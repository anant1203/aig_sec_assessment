      "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\n",
      "Advanced Communications Group, Inc. (\"ACG\") was incorporated in Delaware in September 1997 as a subsidiary of a predecessor company that was ultimately named Advanced Communications Corp. (\"ACC\"). ACC was formed in June 1996 and had previously been named Advanced Communications Group, Inc. By September 1997, ACC had entered into acquisition agreements to acquire a number of companies in various aspects of the telecommunications business. In October 1997, in order to facilitate these acquisitions, ACG entered into new definitive agreements to acquire the stock or assets of six telecommunications service providers, one yellow page publisher, two telephone equipment sales and maintenance companies, ACC, and a 49% interest in a company owning a fiber optic network (collectively, the \"Acquisitions\"). Shortly thereafter, ACG filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"Commission\") with respect to an initial public offering (\"IPO\") of its common stock, par value $.0001 per share (\"Common Stock\"). The Registration Statement, as amended, was declared effective on February 12, 1998. On February 18, 1998, ACG consummated the IPO and the Acquisitions, including a merger of ACC into a subsidiary of ACG pursuant to which ACC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ACG. Hereafter, unless the context otherwise indicates, references herein to (i) \"ACG\" refer to ACG and its predecessor, and (ii) the \"Company\" refer collectively to the entities acquired in the Acquisitions other than the interest in the fiber optic network company (collectively, the \"Acquired Companies\"), ACG and its predecessor company. Prior to February 1998, ACG had not conducted any operations other than those relating to the IPO and the Acquisitions. Consequently, the financial statements included herein relate only to ACG. The Company will file a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q which will include, among other things, financial statements reflecting the operations of the Company from February 18, 1998 through March 31, 1998. The Company will also file an amendment to Current Report on Form 8-K/A by May 4, 1998, to reflect, among other things, results of operations for the Acquired Companies for the year ended December 31, 1997, as well as pro forma combined financial statements as of December 31, 1997. At the time such Form 8-K/A is filed, the Company also intends to amend this Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect the information in such Form 8-K/A.\n",
      "In the Acquisitions, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Great Western Directories, Inc., Valu-Line of Longview, Inc., Feist Long Distance Service, Inc., FirsTel, Inc., and Tele-Systems, Inc., substantially all of the assets of Long Distance Management II, Inc., Long Distance Management of Kansas, Inc., The Switchboard of Oklahoma City, Inc., and National Telecom, a proprietorship, and 49% of the outstanding capital stock of KIN Network, Inc. In the aggregate, the consideration paid by the Company in the Acquisitions included $83.3 million in cash, 3,383,589 shares of Common Stock, $17.4 million in promissory notes, and options and warrants to purchase 1,393,213 shares of Common Stock.\n",

In February 1998, the Company's Board of Directors approved an approximately 1-for-2.645 reverse stock split. At March 27, 1998, 19,615,874 shares of Common Stock and 142,857 shares of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock were outstanding.\n",

      "DIVIDEND POLICY\n",
      "No dividends have been paid on the Common Stock since ACG's inception. It is the Company's current intention to retain its earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of its business and for general corporate purposes and the Company expects that it will not pay any dividends for the foreseeable future. Any future dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including, among others, the Company's financial condition, results of operations, cash flows from operations, current and anticipated cash needs, general business conditions, the income tax laws then in effect, the requirements of Delaware law, any restrictions that may be imposed by any credit facilities or other future indebtedness and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. Any credit facility which the Company may obtain for working capital requirements in the foreseeable future may place limitations on the payment of dividends (except for dividends payable in Common Stock and certain preferred stock). The Company is exploring alternatives with respect to credit facilities.\n",
      "USE OF PROCEEDS OF INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING\n",
      "The Registration Statement on Form S-1 relating to the Common Stock sold in the IPO was declared effective on February 12, 1998. The IPO, for which PaineWebber Incorporated and CIBC Oppenheimer acted as managing underwriters, commenced on that date and has terminated. Pursuant to the Registration Statement, the Company registered the sale of $138,000,000 of Common Stock. In the IPO, the Company sold 8,000,000 shares of Common Stock at an initial public offering price of $14.00 per share, for an aggregate initial public offering price of $112,000,000. The amount of expenses incurred for the Company's account in connection with the IPO for aggregate underwriting discounts and commissions, estimated other expenses and estimated total expenses (including underwriting discounts and commissions) were, respectively, $7,840,000, approximately $4,075,000 (including $500,000 of accounting fees paid prior to the consummation of the IPO) and approximately $11,915,000 (including $500,000 of accounting fees paid prior to the consummation of the IPO). The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the shares of Common Stock in the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, was $100.6 million. Of those net proceeds, $73.3 million was used to pay the\n",
      "aggregate cash portion of the purchase price for the Acquired Companies, $10.0 million was used to make a direct cash investment in KIN Network, Inc., a fiber optic network company, and the remaining net proceeds were used for (i) the repayment of outstanding principal amount of indebtedness and certain other payables of the Acquired Companies (approximately $2.3 million); (ii) the repayment of outstanding principal amount of indebtedness of the Company to CPFF (which until it distributes shares of Common Stock to its interest owners pursuant to its regulations will be the largest holder of Common Stock) (approximately $3.2 million); (iii) a one-time payment to Rod K. Cutsinger, the founder and a director of the Company, as consideration for a five-year non-competition agreement ($1.75 million); and (iv) working capital and other general corporate purposes. Shareholders of the Acquired Companies who became executive officers or directors of the Company upon the consummation of the Acquisitions received approximately $35.6 million of the cash purchase price paid in the Acquisitions.\n",

      "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIOD FROM INCEPTION (JUNE 6, 1996) TO DECEMBER 31, 1996 COMPARED WITH THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997.\n",
      "General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense increased by $2,291,539 from $648,930 during the period from inception (June 6, 1996) to December 31, 1996, to $2,940,469 for the year ended December 31, 1997. During 1997, stock option and warrant compensation expense, consulting expense, employee compensation expense, and legal fees increased by $870,000, $304,520, $410,444, and $425,901, respectively, accounting for $2,010,865 or 88% of the above increase in general and administrative expense. The increase in stock option and warrant compensation expense is primarily attributable to options for 300,000 shares of Common Stock granted to two senior officers of the Company in December 1997. These options are exercisable at a price of $2.50 per share and fully vest over a three month period from the date of grant. The increase in consulting expense is due largely to fees paid to a management recruiting firm for services in connection with placing the Company's senior management team. Employee compensation expense increased primarily as a result of signing bonuses and fourth quarter salaries paid to the Company's new senior officers. The increase in legal fees is attributable to additional legal services performed in connection with the negotiation and preparation of the Company's agreements covering the Acquisitions and related matters.\n",
      "LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n",
      "For the twelve months ended December 31, 1997, net cash used in operating and investing activities was largely offset by net cash provided from financing activities, specifically from borrowings under a note payable to CPFF, a major stockholder of the Company. During 1997, the Company increased its borrowings under this note by $2,309,562 to $2,874,609. Related interest expense increased during the year by $256,217. Drawings under this note represented essentially the Company's sole source of funding pending its initial public offering. The IPO was successfully completed in February 1998, enabling the Company to repay its entire indebtedness to CPFF and to close the Acquisitions.\n",
      "YEAR 2000\n",
      "Many computer software systems, as well as certain hardware and equipment containing date sensitive data, were structured to utilize a two-digit year field, meaning, among other things, that they may not be able to properly recognize dates in the year 2000. This could result in significant system and equipment failures. While the Company believes that its software applications are year 2000 compliant, there can be no assurance until the year 2000 occurs that all systems will then actually function adequately. Further, if the software applications of local exchange carriers, long distance carriers or others on whose services the Company depends are not year 2000 compliant resulting in any loss of such services, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Unanticipated problems in any of the above areas, or the Company's inability to implement solutions in a timely manner or to upgrade existing systems as necessary, could have a material adverse impact on the ability of the Company to reach its objectives and on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. It is not possible to quantify the aggregate cost to\n",

      "Advanced Communications Group, Inc. (\"ACG\") was incorporated in Delaware in September 1997 as a subsidiary of a predecessor company that was ultimately named Advanced Communications Corp. (\"ACC\"). ACC was formed in June 1996 and had previously been named Advanced Communications Group, Inc. By September 1997, ACC had entered into acquisition agreements to acquire a number of companies in various aspects of the telecommunications business. In October 1997, in order to facilitate these acquisitions, ACG entered into new definitive agreements to acquire the stock or assets of six telecommunications service providers, one yellow page publisher, two telephone equipment sales and maintenance companies, ACC, and a 49% interest in a company owning a fiber optic network (collectively, the \"Acquisitions\"). Shortly thereafter, ACG filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"Commission\") with respect to an initial public offering (\"IPO\") of its common stock, par value $.0001 per share (\"Common Stock\"). The Registration Statement, as amended, was declared effective on February 12, 1998. On February 18, 1998, ACG consummated the IPO and the Acquisitions, including a merger of ACC into a subsidiary of ACG pursuant to which ACC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ACG. Hereafter, unless the context otherwise indicates, references to \"ACG\" or the \"Company\" refer to ACG and its predecessor. Prior to February 1998, ACG had not conducted any operations other than those relating to the IPO and the Acquisitions. Consequently, the financial statements included herein relate only to ACG. All intercompany accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.\n",
      "In 1997, the Company signed definitive agreements pursuant to which it agreed to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of Great Western Directories, Inc., Valu-Line of Longview, Inc., Feist Long Distance Service, Inc., FirsTel, Inc. and Tele-Systems, Inc., substantially all of the assets of Long Distance Management II, Inc., Long Distance Management of Kansas, Inc., The Switchboard of Oklahoma City, Inc., and National Telecom, a proprietorship, and 49% of the outstanding capital stock of KIN Network, Inc. (\"Acquisitions\"). The consideration to be paid by the Company in the Acquisitions includes $83.3 million in cash, shares of the Company's Common Stock valued for purposes of computing the estimated purchase price for accounting purposes at $37.9 million, $17.4 million in promissory notes, and options and warrants to purchase 1,393,213 shares of the Company's Common Stock.\n",
      "2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:\n",
      "Deferred acquisition and deferred offering costs -- The Company has deferred certain legal, accounting, appraisal and other costs incurred in connection with the Acquisitions and the IPO. At December 31, 1996 and 1997, deferred acquisition costs amounted to approximately $40,900 and $929,000, respectively, and deferred offering costs amounted to $2,700 and $1,756,800, respectively. At such time as the Acquisitions are completed, deferred acquisition costs will be included in the determination of excess purchase price. Deferred offering costs will be charged to additional paid-in capital upon the closing of the IPO.\n",
      "Office furniture and equipment -- Office furniture and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the respective lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives are as follows:\n",
      "Furniture and fixtures 7 years\n",
      "Computer equipment and software 3 years\n",
      "Income taxes -- No provision for Federal, state and local income taxes has been made because the Company has sustained cumulative losses since its inception in June 1996. A 100% valuation allowance has been established for the related deferred tax asset.\n",
      "Net Loss Per Share - The Company has adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 128, \"Earnings per Share\", which replaces the presentation of primary earnings per share and fully diluted earnings per share with a presentation of basic earnings per share (\"Basic EPS\") and diluted earnings per share (\"Diluted EPS\"). Basic EPS excludes dilution and is determined by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities and other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Adoption of SFAS No. 128 did not change EPS as previously reported for 1996.\n",
      "The weighted average shares outstanding were 8,227,736 for the period from inception (June 6, 1996) through December 31, 1996 and 8,230,006 for the year ended December 31, 1997. In calculating diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 1997, options to purchase 1,525,000 shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from $2.50 to $14.00 per share, and warrants to purchase 1,296,199 shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from $2.50 to $6.61 per share were outstanding during part of 1997 but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS due to their antidilutive effect.\n",
      "Use of Estimates -- The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n",
      "Stock Based Compensation -- SFAS No. 123, \"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,\" allows entities to choose between a new fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options or similar equity instruments and the current intrinsic, value-based method of accounting required by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (\"APB No. 25\"). The Company has elected to remain with the accounting in APB No. 25 and has included in these financial statements pro forma disclosures of net loss and net loss per share as if the fair value method of accounting had been applied. No employee stock options or similar equity instruments were issued by the Company prior to January 1, 1997.\n",
      "3. TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES:\n",
      "COMMON OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT\n",
      "At December 31, 1996 and 1997, a total of 7,986,074 shares and 7,915,192 shares, respectively, of the Company's Common Stock was owned by Consolidation Partners Founding Fund, L.L.C., (\"CPFF\") and by individuals who then served as directors of both the Company and CPFF and who own the controlling interest in CPFF.\n",
      "SUBORDINATED PROMISSORY NOTE IN FAVOR OF CPFF\n",
      "The Company's activities have been financed through a subordinated note agreement with CPFF. In September 1996, the Company executed a Subordinated Promissory Note (the \"Note\") in favor of CPFF in the principal amount of $1,200,000 and bearing an annual interest rate of eight (8%) percent. Under its original terms, the principal and accrued interest under the Note were to be paid in full on the earlier of September 15, 1997, or the date on which the Company's common stock became listed or quoted on a national basis. During 1996 and 1997, the Company incurred interest expense of $9,890 and $256,289, respectively, under the Note. Between September 1997 and February 1998, the Company and CPFF amended the terms of the Note three times to provide for increases in the principal balance to $3,230,000, and to extend the maturity of the Note to the earlier of December 31, 1998 or the consummation of the IPO. At December 31, 1997 and 1996, the principal balance under the Note was approximately $565,000 and $2,875,000, respectively. In connection with the IPO in February 1998, the entire Note balance was repaid.\n",
      "STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS\n",
      "In May 1997 the Company granted to one of its consultants a warrant for the purchase of 7,561 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.65 per share. This warrant is exercisable in whole or in part at any time up to its expiration date in May 2007. In connection with the issuance of this warrant, the Company recorded a non-recurring, non-cash compensation expense of $20,000 reflecting the difference between the exercise price for the shares and the estimated fair value of the warrant at the date of grant.\n",
      "During July 1997, the Company agreed to issue a similar warrant to purchase 7,560 shares of common stock at $6.61 per share to another consultant. No compensation expense was recorded related to this warrant as the estimated fair value of the warrant was equal to the exercise price on the date of grant.\n",
      "In connection with the Great Western Directories, Inc. (\"Great Western\") acquisition agreement, the Company issued warrants to purchase 756,078 shares of common stock at $6.61 per share. Based on an independent appraisal, the fair value of these warrants was determined to be $367,000 on the date of grant, which was recorded as deferred acquisition costs by the Company.\n",
      "In June 1997, the Company granted options for the purchase of 775,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to the fair value of a share of common stock at the date of grant, specifically $2.50 per share, to three individuals. In December 1997, two of these individuals exchanged their options to purchase 525,000 shares of common stock for ten-year, fully vested warrants to purchase a like number of shares of common stock at the same exercise price.\n",
      "EMPLOYEE AND DIRECTOR STOCK OPTIONS\n",
      "In June 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved a Stock Awards Plan (the \"Plan\") which provides for the granting or awarding of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted or deferred stock, dividend equivalents and other incentive awards to directors, officers, and key\n",
      "employees of the Company. The number of shares of common stock authorized and reserved for issuance under the Plan is 3,500,000 shares.\n",
      "During 1997, the Company agreed to make various grants and awards under the Plan to employees and officers of the Acquired Companies, and to certain individuals who became officers of the Company. These options will be exercisable at the initial offering price and have various vesting and termination provisions. In addition, the Company has agreed to compensate each of its outside directors with an option award for 15,000 shares of common stock upon election to the board and an additional option award of 5,000 shares of common stock upon each subsequent re-election of the director. At December 31, 1997, no director options had yet been granted.\n",
      "During December 1997, the Company awarded to three of its officers ten-year options to purchase 1,275,000 shares of common stock, consisting of options for 300,000 shares exercisable at $2.50 per share which vest in full at the end of three months, and options for 975,000 shares of common stock exercisable at the initial public offering price ($14.00) which vest in three equal increments on the first three anniversaries of the date of grant. During the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company recognized $850,000 of compensation expense related to these options.\n",
      "At December 31, 1997, there were 2,225,000 additional shares available for grant under the Plan. The per share weighted-average value of stock options granted during 1997 was $8.63 using the Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions: weighted-average risk-free interest rate of 6.50%, expected life of 10 years, expected volatility of 60%, and an expected dividend yield of zero percent.\n",
      "The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for the Plan. Accordingly, apart from the compensation expense referred to above, the Company has not recognized compensation expense related to the issuance of options for the purchase of its common stock. Had the Company determined compensation expense based on the fair value at the date of grant for its stock options under SFAS No. 123, the Company's net loss would have been increased to the pro forma amounts indicated below:\n",
      "Net loss: As reported $3,200,035 Pro forma $5,972,195 Basic and diluted loss per share: As reported $0.39 Pro forma $0.73\n",
      "At December 31, 1997, the range of exercise prices and weighted-average remaining contractual lives of the options was $2.50 to $14.00 per share and 10 years, respectively. No options were exercisable at December 31, 1997. Stock option activity during the periods indicated is as follows:\n",
      "Weighted- average Number of Exercise Shares price --------- --------- Balance, December 31, 1996 -- $ -- Options granted 1,275,000 11.29 --------- --------- Balance, December 31, 1997 1,275,000 $11.29 ========= =========\n",
      "OTHER COMMITMENTS\n",
      "In January 1997, the Company entered into a four year lease agreement with CPFF pursuant to which the Company leases furniture and office equipment. Under this agreement the Company is obligated to make monthly rental payments to CPFF of $1,163. For the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company recognized approximately $14,000 of rental expense related to this lease agreement.\n",
      "The Company has entered into six-year employment agreements with three officers of the Company. These agreements provide for annual salaries plus potential bonuses and stock option grants as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.\n",
      "5. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS:\n",
      "In January 1998, the Company entered into an agreement with a certain utility company regarding the possible creation of a strategic alliance. Under the terms of the agreement, which was consummated contemporaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, the Company issued 142,857 shares of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (\"Preferred Stock\") with an aggregate liquidation preference of $2 million. The Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of common stock at the initial public offering price ($14.00) eighteen months after the consummation of the initial public offering. The Preferred Stock does not pay dividends and is not entitled to vote in the election of directors. If a strategic alliance has not been entered into by the 13th month after the initial public offering, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Preferred Stock for total proceeds of $1.25 million. The Company has discussed, and continues to discuss, similar strategic alliances with other utility companies.\n",
      "In February 1998, the Company's Board of Directors approved an approximately 1-for-2.645 reverse stock split, subject to stockholder approval. This reverse stock split has been reflected retroactively for all periods presented.\n",
      "In February 1998, the Company completed an initial public offering of 8,000,000 shares of its common stock, and closed on the Acquisitions. Proceeds from the IPO, net of offering costs, were $100.6 million of which $83.3 million was paid to acquire the Acquired Companies, $5.5 million was paid to retire debt of the Company and the Acquired Companies, and $1.75 million was paid to a stockholder for a five-year non-compete agreement. Stockholders of the Acquired Companies who became executive officers or directors of the Company upon the consummation of the Acquisition received approximately $35.6 million of the cash purchase price paid in the Acquisitions.\n",
      "Prior to the pricing of the IPO, Richard O'Neal, the principal shareholder of Great Western, expressed disagreement with the effect of the reverse stock split on certain warrants that had been issued to the stockholders of Great Western at the time of the execution of the initial acquisition agreement between the Company and Great Western (the \"Warrants\"). CPFF and Mr. O'Neal agreed to engage in good faith negotiations to determine the type and amount of any consideration appropriately payable by CPFF to the holders of the Warrants following the consummation of the IPO. As of March 30, 1998, no negotiated settlement had been reached and Mr. O'Neal had delivered to CPFF a demand for binding arbitration. CPFF has agreed not to effect any distribution of the Company's Common Stock to its interest owners prior to the resolution of these matters. The resolution of this matter is solely between CPFF and the principal shareholder of Great Western. The Company shall have no liability with respect to the resolution of this matter and no additional Common Stock or equivalents will be issued in connection therewith. In no event shall any assets of the Company be used too satisfy any negotiated settlement or arbitration award.\n",

BUSINESS\\nAdvanced Communications Group, Inc. (\"ACG\") was incorporated in Delaware in September 1997 as a subsidiary of a predecessor company that was ultimately named Advanced Communications Corp. (\"ACC\"). ACC was formed in June 1996 and had previously been named Advanced Communications Group, Inc. By September 1997, ACC had entered into acquisition agreements to acquire a number of companies in various aspects of the telecommunications business. In October 1997, in order to facilitate these acquisitions, ACG entered into new definitive agreements to acquire the stock or assets of six telecommunications service providers, one yellow page publisher, two telephone equipment sales and maintenance companies, ACC, and a 49% interest in a company owning a fiber optic network (collectively, the \"Acquisitions\"). Shortly thereafter, ACG filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"Commission\") with respect to an initial public offering (\"IPO\") of its common stock, par value $.0001 per share (\"Common Stock\"). The Registration Statement, as amended, was declared effective on February 12, 1998. On February 18, 1998, ACG consummated the IPO and the Acquisitions, including a merger of ACC into a subsidiary of ACG pursuant to which ACC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ACG. Hereafter, unless the context otherwise indicates, references herein to (i) \"ACG\" refer to ACG and its predecessor, and (ii) the \"Company\" refer collectively to the entities acquired in the Acquisitions other than the interest in the fiber optic network company (collectively, the \"Acquired Companies\"), ACG and its predecessor company. Prior to February 1998, ACG had not conducted any operations other than those relating to the IPO and the Acquisitions. Consequently, the financial statements included herein relate only to ACG. The Company will file a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q which will include, among other things, financial statements reflecting the operations of the Company from February 18, 1998 through March 31, 1998. The Company will also file an amendment to Current Report on Form 8-K/A by May 4, 1998, to reflect, among other things, results of operations for the Acquired Companies for the year ended December 31, 1997, as well as pro forma combined financial statements as of December 31, 1997. At the time such Form 8-K/A is filed, the Company also intends to amend this Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect the information in such Form 8-K/A.\\nIn the Acquisitions, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Great Western Directories, Inc., Valu-Line of Longview, Inc., Feist Long Distance Service, Inc., FirsTel, Inc., and Tele-Systems, Inc., substantially all of the assets of Long Distance Management II, Inc., Long Distance Management of Kansas, Inc., The Switchboard of Oklahoma City, Inc., and National Telecom, a proprietorship, and 49% of the outstanding capital stock of KIN Network, Inc. In the aggregate, the consideration paid by the Company in the Acquisitions included $83.3 million in cash, 3,383,589 shares of Common Stock, $17.4 million in promissory notes, and options and warrants to purchase 1,393,213 shares of Common Stock.\\nThe Company was founded to create a regional competitive local exchange carrier that provides an integrated portfolio of telecommunications services principally to business customers in selected service areas of Southwestern Bell Telephone Company and U S WEST Communications, Inc.\\nA copy of the Company\\'s Registration Statement on Form S-1 (Registration No. 333-37671) as amended by Amendment No. 3, in the form it was declared effective by the Commission (the \"Registration Statement\"), without Exhibits, is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1, and the Prospectus included therein is\\nreferred to herein as the \"Prospectus.\" The information appearing in the Prospectus under the captions \"Prospectus Summary,\" \"Risk Factors,\" \"The Company,\" \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Certain Acquired Companies -- Overview of the Acquired Companies\\' Sources of Revenues and Expenses,\" \"Industry Background and Overview,\" and \"Business\" is incorporated herein by reference.\\nITEM 2.\\n\\n## SECTION 2\\nITEM 2.

MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT\\'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS\\nThe Company is authorized to issue 180,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $.0001 per share (the \"Common Stock\") and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.0001 per share (the \"Preferred Stock\"). In February 1998, the Company\\'s Board of Directors approved an approximately 1-for-2.645 reverse stock split. At March 27, 1998, 19,615,874 shares of Common Stock and 142,857 shares of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock were outstanding.\\nThe Company\\'s Common Stock became listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") under the symbol \"ADG\" in February 1998. Prior to that time, there was no trading in the Common Stock.\\nAs of March 27, 1998, there were 75 record owners of the Common Stock. On that date, the closing price of the Common Stock on the NYSE was $16.4375.\\nDIVIDEND POLICY\\nNo dividends have been paid on the Common Stock since ACG\\'s inception. It is the Company\\'s current intention to retain its earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of its business and for general corporate purposes and the Company expects that it will not pay any dividends for the foreseeable future. Any future dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including, among others, the Company\\'s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows from operations, current and anticipated cash needs, general business conditions, the income tax laws then in effect, the requirements of Delaware law, any restrictions that may be imposed by any credit facilities or other future indebtedness and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. Any credit facility which the Company may obtain for working capital requirements in the foreseeable future may place limitations on the payment of dividends (except for dividends payable in Common Stock and certain preferred stock). The Company is exploring alternatives with respect to credit facilities.\\nUSE OF PROCEEDS OF INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING\\nThe Registration Statement on Form S-1 relating to the Common Stock sold in the IPO was declared effective on February 12, 1998. The IPO, for which PaineWebber Incorporated and CIBC Oppenheimer acted as managing underwriters, commenced on that date and has terminated. Pursuant to the Registration Statement, the Company registered the sale of $138,000,000 of Common Stock. In the IPO, the Company sold 8,000,000 shares of Common Stock at an initial public offering price of $14.00 per share, for an aggregate initial public offering price of $112,000,000. The amount of expenses incurred for the Company\\'s account in connection with the IPO for aggregate underwriting discounts and commissions, estimated other expenses and estimated total expenses (including underwriting discounts and commissions) were, respectively, $7,840,000, approximately $4,075,000 (including $500,000 of accounting fees paid prior to the consummation of the IPO) and approximately $11,915,000 (including $500,000 of accounting fees paid prior to the consummation of the IPO). The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the shares of Common Stock in the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, was $100.6 million. Of those net proceeds, $73.3 million was used to pay the\\naggregate cash portion of the purchase price for the Acquired Companies, $10.0 million was used to make a direct cash investment in KIN Network, Inc., a fiber optic network company, and the remaining net proceeds were used for (i) the repayment of outstanding principal amount of indebtedness and certain other payables of the Acquired Companies (approximately $2.3 million); (ii) the repayment of outstanding principal amount of indebtedness of the Company to CPFF (which until it distributes shares of Common Stock to its interest owners pursuant to its regulations will be the largest holder of Common Stock) (approximately $3.2 million); (iii) a one-time payment to Rod K. Cutsinger, the founder and a director of the Company, as consideration for a five-year non-competition agreement ($1.75 million); and (iv) working capital and other general corporate purposes. Shareholders of the Acquired Companies who became executive officers or directors of the Company upon the consummation of the Acquisitions received approximately $35.6 million of the cash purchase price paid in the Acquisitions.\\nRECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES\\nThe information appearing in the final nine paragraphs of Item 15 \"Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities\" in Part II of the Registration Statement is incorporated herein by reference.\\nITEM 6.\\n\\n## SECTION 6\\nITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA\\nThe following selected financial data for ACG has been derived from the audited financial statements of ACG. Because the Acquisitions were not consummated until February 18, 1998, no effect is given to them in the financial statements presented herein.\\n(1) Restated for February 1998 1-for-2.645 reverse stock split.\\nITEM 7.\\n\\n## SECTION 7\\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIOD FROM INCEPTION (JUNE 6, 1996) TO DECEMBER 31, 1996 COMPARED WITH THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997.\\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense increased by $2,291,539 from $648,930 during the period from inception (June 6, 1996) to December 31, 1996, to $2,940,469 for the year ended December 31, 1997. During 1997, stock option and warrant compensation expense, consulting expense, employee compensation expense, and legal fees increased by $870,000, $304,520, $410,444, and $425,901, respectively, accounting for $2,010,865 or 88% of the above increase in general and administrative expense. The increase in stock option and warrant compensation expense is primarily attributable to options for 300,000 shares of Common Stock granted to two senior officers of the Company in December 1997. These options are exercisable at a price of $2.50 per share and fully vest over a three month period from the date of grant. The increase in consulting expense is due largely to fees paid to a management recruiting firm for services in connection with placing the Company\\'s senior management team. Employee compensation expense increased primarily as a result of signing bonuses and fourth quarter salaries paid to the Company\\'s new senior officers. The increase in legal fees is attributable to additional legal services performed in connection with the negotiation and preparation of the Company\\'s agreements covering the Acquisitions and related matters.\\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 1997, net cash used in operating and investing activities was largely offset by net cash provided from financing activities, specifically from borrowings under a note payable to CPFF, a major stockholder of the Company. During 1997, the Company increased its borrowings under this note by $2,309,562 to $2,874,609. Related interest expense increased during the year by $256,217. Drawings under this note represented essentially the Company\\'s sole source of funding pending its initial public offering. The IPO was successfully completed in February 1998, enabling the Company to repay its entire indebtedness to CPFF and to close the Acquisitions.\\nYEAR 2000\\nMany computer software systems, as well as certain hardware and equipment containing date sensitive data, were structured to utilize a two-digit year field, meaning, among other things, that they may not be able to properly recognize dates in the year 2000. This could result in significant system and equipment failures. While the Company believes that its software applications are year 2000 compliant, there can be no assurance until the year 2000 occurs that all systems will then actually function adequately. Further, if the software applications of local exchange carriers, long distance carriers or others on whose services the Company depends are not year 2000 compliant resulting in any loss of such services, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\\'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Unanticipated problems in any of the above areas, or the Company\\'s inability to implement solutions in a timely manner or to upgrade existing systems as necessary, could have a material adverse impact on the ability of the Company to reach its objectives and on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. It is not possible to quantify the aggregate cost to\\nthe Company with respect to customers and suppliers with Year 2000 problems. The Company is currently in the planning stages of developing new data processing systems throughout its organization for management, operating and financial information.\\nOTHER MATTERS\\nThe information in the Prospectus appearing under the captions \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Certain Acquired Companies -- Overview of the Acquired Companies\\' Sources of Revenues and Expenses\" are incorporated herein by reference.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\\nINDEPENDENT AUDITORS\\' REPORT\\nThe Board of Directors Advanced Communications Group, Inc.\\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Advanced Communications Group, Inc. as of December 31, 1996 and 1997, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders\\' deficit, and cash flows for the period from inception (June 6, 1996) through December 31, 1996 and for the year ended December 31, 1997. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\\'s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Advanced Communications Group, Inc. as of December 31, 1996 and 1997, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from inception (June 6, 1996) through December 31, 1996 and for the year ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.\\nKPMG Peat Marwick LLP Houston, Texas March 23, 1998\\nADVANCED COMMUNICATIONS GROUP, INC.\\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\\nADVANCED COMMUNICATIONS GROUP, INC.\\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\\nADVANCED COMMUNICATIONS GROUP, INC.\\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS\\' DEFICIT FOR THE PERIOD FROM INCEPTION (JUNE 6, 1996) THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 1997\\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\\nADVANCED COMMUNICATIONS GROUP, INC.\\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\\nADVANCED COMMUNICATIONS GROUP, INC.\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 1996 AND DECEMBER 31, 1997\\n1. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS:\\nAdvanced Communications Group, Inc. (\"ACG\") was incorporated in Delaware in September 1997 as a subsidiary of a predecessor company that was ultimately named Advanced Communications Corp. (\"ACC\"). ACC was formed in June 1996 and had previously been named Advanced Communications Group, Inc. By September 1997, ACC had entered into acquisition agreements to acquire a number of companies in various aspects of the telecommunications business. In October 1997, in order to facilitate these acquisitions, ACG entered into new definitive agreements to acquire the stock or assets of six telecommunications service providers, one yellow page publisher, two telephone equipment sales and maintenance companies, ACC, and a 49% interest in a company owning a fiber optic network (collectively, the \"Acquisitions\"). Shortly thereafter, ACG filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"Commission\") with respect to an initial public offering (\"IPO\") of its common stock, par value $.0001 per share (\"Common Stock\"). The Registration Statement, as amended, was declared effective on February 12, 1998. On February 18, 1998, ACG consummated the IPO and the Acquisitions, including a merger of ACC into a subsidiary of ACG pursuant to which ACC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ACG. Hereafter, unless the context otherwise indicates, references to \"ACG\" or the \"Company\" refer to ACG and its predecessor. Prior to February 1998, ACG had not conducted any operations other than those relating to the IPO and the Acquisitions. Consequently, the financial statements included herein relate only to ACG. All intercompany accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.\\nIn 1997, the Company signed definitive agreements pursuant to which it agreed to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of Great Western Directories, Inc., Valu-Line of Longview, Inc., Feist Long Distance Service, Inc., FirsTel, Inc. and Tele-Systems, Inc., substantially all of the assets of Long Distance Management II, Inc., Long Distance Management of Kansas, Inc., The Switchboard of Oklahoma City, Inc., and National Telecom, a proprietorship, and 49% of the outstanding capital stock of KIN Network, Inc. (\"Acquisitions\"). The consideration to be paid by the Company in the Acquisitions includes $83.3 million in cash, shares of the Company\\'s Common Stock valued for purposes of computing the estimated purchase price for accounting purposes at $37.9 million, $17.4 million in promissory notes, and options and warrants to purchase 1,393,213 shares of the Company\\'s Common Stock.\\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:\\nDeferred acquisition and deferred offering costs -- The Company has deferred certain legal, accounting, appraisal and other costs incurred in connection with the Acquisitions and the IPO. At December 31, 1996 and 1997, deferred acquisition costs amounted to approximately $40,900 and $929,000, respectively, and deferred offering costs amounted to $2,700 and $1,756,800, respectively. At such time as the Acquisitions are completed, deferred acquisition costs will be included in the determination of excess purchase price. Deferred offering costs will be charged to additional paid-in capital upon the closing of the IPO.\\nOffice furniture and equipment -- Office furniture and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the respective lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives are as follows:\\nFurniture and fixtures 7 years\\nComputer equipment and software 3 years\\nIncome taxes -- No provision for Federal, state and local income taxes has been made because the Company has sustained cumulative losses since its inception in June 1996. A 100% valuation allowance has been established for the related deferred tax asset.\\nNet Loss Per Share - The Company has adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 128, \"Earnings per Share\", which replaces the presentation of primary earnings per share and fully diluted earnings per share with a presentation of basic earnings per share (\"Basic EPS\") and diluted earnings per share (\"Diluted EPS\"). Basic EPS excludes dilution and is determined by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities and other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Adoption of SFAS No. 128 did not change EPS as previously reported for 1996.\\nThe weighted average shares outstanding were 8,227,736 for the period from inception (June 6, 1996) through December 31, 1996 and 8,230,006 for the year ended December 31, 1997. In calculating diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 1997, options to purchase 1,525,000 shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from $2.50 to $14.00 per share, and warrants to purchase 1,296,199 shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from $2.50 to $6.61 per share were outstanding during part of 1997 but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS due to their antidilutive effect.\\nUse of Estimates -- The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\\nStock Based Compensation -- SFAS No. 123, \"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,\" allows entities to choose between a new fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options or similar equity instruments and the current intrinsic, value-based method of accounting required by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (\"APB No. 25\"). The Company has elected to remain with the accounting in APB No. 25 and has included in these financial statements pro forma disclosures of net loss and net loss per share as if the fair value method of accounting had been applied. No employee stock options or similar equity instruments were issued by the Company prior to January 1, 1997.\\n3. TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES:\\nCOMMON OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT\\nAt December 31, 1996 and 1997, a total of 7,986,074 shares and 7,915,192 shares, respectively, of the Company\\'s Common Stock was owned by Consolidation Partners Founding Fund, L.L.C., (\"CPFF\") and by individuals who then served as directors of both the Company and CPFF and who own the controlling interest in CPFF.\\nSUBORDINATED PROMISSORY NOTE IN FAVOR OF CPFF\\nThe Company\\'s activities have been financed through a subordinated note agreement with CPFF. In September 1996, the Company executed a Subordinated Promissory Note (the \"Note\") in favor of CPFF in the principal amount of $1,200,000 and bearing an annual interest rate of eight (8%) percent. Under its original terms, the principal and accrued interest under the Note were to be paid in full on the earlier of September 15, 1997, or the date on which the Company\\'s common stock became listed or quoted on a national basis. During 1996 and 1997, the Company incurred interest expense of $9,890 and $256,289, respectively, under the Note. Between September 1997 and February 1998, the Company and CPFF amended the terms of the Note three times to provide for increases in the principal balance to $3,230,000, and to extend the maturity of the Note to the earlier of December 31, 1998 or the consummation of the IPO. At December 31, 1997 and 1996, the principal balance under the Note was approximately $565,000 and $2,875,000, respectively. In connection with the IPO in February 1998, the entire Note balance was repaid.\\nSTOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS\\nIn May 1997 the Company granted to one of its consultants a warrant for the purchase of 7,561 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.65 per share. This warrant is exercisable in whole or in part at any time up to its expiration date in May 2007. In connection with the issuance of this warrant, the Company recorded a non-recurring, non-cash compensation expense of $20,000 reflecting the difference between the exercise price for the shares and the estimated fair value of the warrant at the date of grant.\\nDuring July 1997, the Company agreed to issue a similar warrant to purchase 7,560 shares of common stock at $6.61 per share to another consultant. No compensation expense was recorded related to this warrant as the estimated fair value of the warrant was equal to the exercise price on the date of grant.\\nIn connection with the Great Western Directories, Inc. (\"Great Western\") acquisition agreement, the Company issued warrants to purchase 756,078 shares of common stock at $6.61 per share. Based on an independent appraisal, the fair value of these warrants was determined to be $367,000 on the date of grant, which was recorded as deferred acquisition costs by the Company.\\nIn June 1997, the Company granted options for the purchase of 775,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to the fair value of a share of common stock at the date of grant, specifically $2.50 per share, to three individuals. In December 1997, two of these individuals exchanged their options to purchase 525,000 shares of common stock for ten-year, fully vested warrants to purchase a like number of shares of common stock at the same exercise price.\\nEMPLOYEE AND DIRECTOR STOCK OPTIONS\\nIn June 1997, the Company\\'s Board of Directors approved a Stock Awards Plan (the \"Plan\") which provides for the granting or awarding of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted or deferred stock, dividend equivalents and other incentive awards to directors, officers, and key\\nemployees of the Company. The number of shares of common stock authorized and reserved for issuance under the Plan is 3,500,000 shares.\\nDuring 1997, the Company agreed to make various grants and awards under the Plan to employees and officers of the Acquired Companies, and to certain individuals who became officers of the Company. These options will be exercisable at the initial offering price and have various vesting and termination provisions. In addition, the Company has agreed to compensate each of its outside directors with an option award for 15,000 shares of common stock upon election to the board and an additional option award of 5,000 shares of common stock upon each subsequent re-election of the director. At December 31, 1997, no director options had yet been granted.\\nDuring December 1997, the Company awarded to three of its officers ten-year options to purchase 1,275,000 shares of common stock, consisting of options for 300,000 shares exercisable at $2.50 per share which vest in full at the end of three months, and options for 975,000 shares of common stock exercisable at the initial public offering price ($14.00) which vest in three equal increments on the first three anniversaries of the date of grant. During the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company recognized $850,000 of compensation expense related to these options.\\nAt December 31, 1997, there were 2,225,000 additional shares available for grant under the Plan. The per share weighted-average value of stock options granted during 1997 was $8.63 using the Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions: weighted-average risk-free interest rate of 6.50%, expected life of 10 years, expected volatility of 60%, and an expected dividend yield of zero percent.\\nThe Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for the Plan. Accordingly, apart from the compensation expense referred to above, the Company has not recognized compensation expense related to the issuance of options for the purchase of its common stock. Had the Company determined compensation expense based on the fair value at the date of grant for its stock options under SFAS No. 123, the Company\\'s net loss would have been increased to the pro forma amounts indicated below:\\nNet loss: As reported $3,200,035 Pro forma $5,972,195 Basic and diluted loss per share: As reported $0.39 Pro forma $0.73\\nAt December 31, 1997, the range of exercise prices and weighted-average remaining contractual lives of the options was $2.50 to $14.00 per share and 10 years, respectively. No options were exercisable at December 31, 1997. Stock option activity during the periods indicated is as follows:\\nWeighted- average Number of Exercise Shares price --------- --------- Balance, December 31, 1996 -- $ -- Options granted 1,275,000 11.29 --------- --------- Balance, December 31, 1997 1,275,000 $11.29 ========= =========\\nOTHER COMMITMENTS\\nIn January 1997, the Company entered into a four year lease agreement with CPFF pursuant to which the Company leases furniture and office equipment. Under this agreement the Company is obligated to make monthly rental payments to CPFF of $1,163. For the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company recognized approximately $14,000 of rental expense related to this lease agreement.\\nThe Company has entered into six-year employment agreements with three officers of the Company. These agreements provide for annual salaries plus potential bonuses and stock option grants as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.\\n5. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS:\\nIn January 1998, the Company entered into an agreement with a certain utility company regarding the possible creation of a strategic alliance. Under the terms of the agreement, which was consummated contemporaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, the Company issued 142,857 shares of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (\"Preferred Stock\") with an aggregate liquidation preference of $2 million. The Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of common stock at the initial public offering price ($14.00) eighteen months after the consummation of the initial public offering. The Preferred Stock does not pay dividends and is not entitled to vote in the election of directors. If a strategic alliance has not been entered into by the 13th month after the initial public offering, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Preferred Stock for total proceeds of $1.25 million. The Company has discussed, and continues to discuss, similar strategic alliances with other utility companies.\\nIn February 1998, the Company\\'s Board of Directors approved an approximately 1-for-2.645 reverse stock split, subject to stockholder approval. This reverse stock split has been reflected retroactively for all periods presented.\\nIn February 1998, the Company completed an initial public offering of 8,000,000 shares of its common stock, and closed on the Acquisitions. Proceeds from the IPO, net of offering costs, were $100.6 million of which $83.3 million was paid to acquire the Acquired Companies, $5.5 million was paid to retire debt of the Company and the Acquired Companies, and $1.75 million was paid to a stockholder for a five-year non-compete agreement. Stockholders of the Acquired Companies who became executive officers or directors of the Company upon the consummation of the Acquisition received approximately $35.6 million of the cash purchase price paid in the Acquisitions.\\nPrior to the pricing of the IPO, Richard O\\'Neal, the principal shareholder of Great Western, expressed disagreement with the effect of the reverse stock split on certain warrants that had been issued to the stockholders of Great Western at the time of the execution of the initial acquisition agreement between the Company and Great Western (the \"Warrants\"). CPFF and Mr. O\\'Neal agreed to engage in good faith negotiations to determine the type and amount of any consideration appropriately payable by CPFF to the holders of the Warrants following the consummation of the IPO. As of March 30, 1998, no negotiated settlement had been reached and Mr. O\\'Neal had delivered to CPFF a demand for binding arbitration. CPFF has agreed not to effect any distribution of the Company\\'s Common Stock to its interest owners prior to the resolution of these matters. The resolution of this matter is solely between CPFF and the principal shareholder of Great Western. The Company shall have no liability with respect to the resolution of this matter and no additional Common Stock or equivalents will be issued in connection therewith. In no event shall any assets of the Company be used too satisfy any negotiated settlement or arbitration award.\\nITEM 9.\\n\\n## SECTION 9\\nITEM 9.

       "'ITEM 1. BUSINESS\\nAdvanced Communications Group, Inc. (\"ACG\") was incorporated in Delaware in September 1997 as a subsidiary of a predecessor company that was ultimately named Advanced Communications Corp. (\"ACC\"). ACC was formed in June 1996 and had previously been named Advanced Communications Group, Inc. By September 1997, ACC had entered into acquisition agreements to acquire a number of companies in various aspects of the telecommunications business. In October 1997, in order to facilitate these acquisitions, ACG entered into new definitive agreements to acquire the stock or assets of six telecommunications service providers, one yellow page publisher, two telephone equipment sales and maintenance companies, ACC, and a 49% interest in a company owning a fiber optic network (collectively, the \"Acquisitions\"). Shortly thereafter, ACG filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"Commission\") with respect to an initial public offering (\"IPO\") of its common stock, par value $.0001 per share (\"Common Stock\"). The Registration Statement, as amended, was declared effective on February 12, 1998. On February 18, 1998, ACG consummated the IPO and the Acquisitions, including a merger of ACC into a subsidiary of ACG pursuant to which ACC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ACG. Hereafter, unless the context otherwise indicates, references herein to (i) \"ACG\" refer to ACG and its predecessor, and (ii) the \"Company\" refer collectively to the entities acquired in the Acquisitions other than the interest in the fiber optic network company (collectively, the \"Acquired Companies\"), ACG and its predecessor company. Prior to February 1998, ACG had not conducted any operations other than those relating to the IPO and the Acquisitions. Consequently, the financial statements included herein relate only to ACG. The Company will file a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q which will include, among other things, financial statements reflecting the operations of the Company from February 18, 1998 through March 31, 1998. The Company will also file an amendment to Current Report on Form 8-K/A by May 4, 1998, to reflect, among other things, results of operations for the Acquired Companies for the year ended December 31, 1997, as well as pro forma combined financial statements as of December 31, 1997. At the time such Form 8-K/A is filed, the Company also intends to amend this Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect the information in such Form 8-K/A.\\nIn the Acquisitions, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Great Western Directories, Inc., Valu-Line of Longview, Inc., Feist Long Distance Service, Inc., FirsTel, Inc., and Tele-Systems, Inc., substantially all of the assets of Long Distance Management II, Inc., Long Distance Management of Kansas, Inc., The Switchboard of Oklahoma City, Inc., and National Telecom, a proprietorship, and 49% of the outstanding capital stock of KIN Network, Inc. In the aggregate, the consideration paid by the Company in the Acquisitions included $83.3 million in cash, 3,383,589 shares of Common Stock, $17.4 million in promissory notes, and options and warrants to purchase 1,393,213 shares of Common Stock.\\nThe Company was founded to create a regional competitive local exchange carrier that provides an integrated portfolio of telecommunications services principally to business customers in selected service areas of Southwestern Bell Telephone Company and U S WEST Communications, Inc.\\nA copy of the Company\\'s Registration Statement on Form S-1 (Registration No. 333-37671) as amended by Amendment No. 3, in the form it was declared effective by the Commission (the \"Registration Statement\"), without Exhibits, is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1, and the Prospectus included therein is\\nreferred to herein as the \"Prospectus.\" The information appearing in the Prospectus under the captions \"Prospectus Summary,\" \"Risk Factors,\" \"The Company,\" \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Certain Acquired Companies -- Overview of the Acquired Companies\\' Sources of Revenues and Expenses,\" \"Industry Background and Overview,\" and \"Business\" is incorporated herein by reference.\\nITEM 2.'"
