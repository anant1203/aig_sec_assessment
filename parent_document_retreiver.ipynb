      "- Ratios: We, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses (which for Commercial Insurance excludes net loss reserve discount), and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. Our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under GAAP, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios.

      "Overview of Loss Reserving Process and Methods\n",
      "Our loss reserves can generally be categorized into two distinct groups. Short-tail reserves consists principally of U.S. and Europe Property and Special Risks, and U.S., Europe and Japan Personal Insurance. Long-tail reserves include U.S. Workers’ Compensation, U.S. Excess Casualty, U.S. Other Casualty, U.S. Financial Lines, Europe Casualty and Financial Lines, and U.S. Run-off Long Tail Insurance Lines.\n",
      "Short-Tail Reserves\n",
      "For our short-tail coverages, such as property, where the nature of claims is generally high frequency but with short reporting periods, with volatility arising from occasional severe events, the process for recording non-catastrophe quarterly loss reserves is geared toward maintaining IBNR based on percentages of net earned premiums for that business, rather than projecting ultimate loss ratios based on reported losses. For example, the IBNR reserve required for the latest accident quarter for a product line of property business such as Personal Lines automobile might be approximately 20 percent of the quarter’s earned premiums. This level of reserve would generally be recorded regardless of the actual losses reported in the current quarter, thus allowing the recognition of severe events as they occur. The percent of premium factor reflects both our expectation of the ultimate loss costs associated with the line of business and the expectation of the percentage of ultimate loss costs that have not yet been reported. The expected ultimate loss costs generally reflect the average loss costs from a period of preceding accident quarters that have been adjusted for changes in rate and loss cost levels, mix of business, known exposure to unreported losses, or other factors affecting the particular line of business. The expected percentage of ultimate loss costs that have not yet been reported would be derived from historical loss emergence patterns. For more mature quarters, loss development methods would be used to determine the IBNR. For other product lines where the nature of claims is high frequency but low severity, methods including loss development, frequency/severity or a multiple of average monthly losses may be used to determine IBNR reserves. IBNR for claims arising from catastrophic events or events of unusual severity would be determined in close collaboration with the claims department’s knowledge of known information, using alternative techniques or expected percentages of ultimate loss cost emergence based on historical loss emergence of similar claim types.\n",
      "Long-Tail Reserves\n",
      "Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss adjustment expenses (net losses) for our long-tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the product line and volume of business, as well as estimates of the reinsurance recoverable. Experience in the more recent accident years generally provides limited statistical credibility of reported net losses on long-tail casualty lines of business. That is because in the more recent accident years, a relatively low proportion of estimated ultimate net incurred losses are reported or paid. Therefore, IBNR reserves constitute a relatively high proportion of net losses.\n",
      "For our longer-tail lines, we generally make actuarial and other assumptions with respect to the following:\n",
      "· Loss cost trend factors are used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on the projected loss ratios for prior accident years.\n",
      "· Expected loss ratios are used for the latest accident year (i.e., accident year 2016 for the year-end 2016 loss reserve analysis) and, in some cases for accident years prior to the latest accident year. The expected loss ratio generally reflects the projected loss ratio from prior accident years, adjusted for the loss cost trend and the effect of rate changes and other quantifiable factors on the loss ratio. For low-frequency, high-severity lines of business such as excess casualty, expected loss ratios generally are used for at least the three most recent accident years.\n",
      "· Loss development factors are used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate basis. Generally, the actual loss development factors observed from prior accident years would be used as a basis to determine the loss development factors for the subsequent accident years.\n",
      "· Tail Factors are development factors used for certain longer tailed lines of business (for example, excess casualty, workers’ compensation and general liability),to project future loss development for periods that extend beyond the available development data. The development of losses to the ultimate loss for a given accident year for these lines may take decades and the projection of ultimate losses for an accident year is very sensitive to the tail factors selected beyond a certain age.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Critical Accounting Estimates\n",
      "We record quarterly changes in loss reserves for each product line of business. The overall change in our loss reserves is based on the sum of the changes for all product lines of business. For most long-tail product lines of business, the quarterly loss reserve changes are based on the estimated current loss ratio for each subset of coverage less any amounts paid. Also, any change in estimated ultimate losses from prior accident years deemed to be necessary based on the results of our latest detailed valuation reviews, large loss analyses, or other analytical techniques, either positive or negative, is reflected in the loss reserve for the current quarter. Differences between actual loss emergence in a given period and our expectations based on prior loss reserve estimates are used to monitor reserve adequacy between detailed valuation reviews and may also influence our judgment with respect to adjusting reserve estimates.\n",
      "Details of the Loss Reserving Process\n",
      "The process of determining the current loss ratio for each product line of business is based on a variety of factors. These include considerations such as: prior accident year and policy year loss ratios; rate changes; and changes in coverage, reinsurance, or mix of business. Other considerations include actual and anticipated changes in external factors such as trends in loss costs, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, inflation, employment rates or unemployment duration, stock market volatility, corporate bond spreads, or in the legal and claims environment. The current loss ratio for each product line of business is intended to represent our best estimate after reflecting all of the relevant factors. At the close of each quarter, the assumptions and data underlying the loss ratios are reviewed to determine whether the loss ratios remain appropriate. This process includes a review of the actual loss experience in the quarter, actual rate changes achieved, actual changes in reinsurance, quantifiable changes in coverage or mix of business, and changes in other factors that may affect the loss ratio. When this review suggests that the previously determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate, the loss ratio is changed to reflect the revised estimates.\n",
      "We conduct a comprehensive loss detailed valuation review at least annually for each product line of business in accordance with Actuarial Standards of Practice. These standards provide that the unpaid loss estimate may be presented in a variety of ways, such as a point estimate, a range of estimates, a point estimate based on the expected value of several reasonable estimates, or a probability distribution of the unpaid loss amount. Our actuarial central estimate for each product line of business represents an expected value generally considering a range of reasonably possible outcomes.\n",
      "The reserve analysis for each product line of business is performed by a credentialed actuarial team in collaboration with claims, underwriting, business unit management, risk management and senior management. Our actuaries consider the ongoing applicability of prior data groupings and update numerous assumptions, including the analysis and selection of loss development and loss trend factors. They also determine and select the most appropriate actuarial or other methods used to estimate reserve adequacy for each business product line, and may employ multiple methods and assumptions for each product line. These data groupings, accident year weights, method selections and assumptions necessarily change over time as business mix changes, development factors mature and become more credible and loss characteristics evolve. In the course of these detailed valuation reviews an actuarial best estimate of the loss reserve is determined. The sum of these estimates for each product line of business yields an overall actuarial best estimate for that line of business.\n",
      "We develop explicit ranges of reasonable estimates around the actuarial best estimate for certain product lines using multiple methodologies and varying assumptions. Where we have ranges, we use them to inform our selection of best estimates of loss reserves by major product line of business. Our range of reasonable estimates is not intended to cover all possibilities or extreme values and is based on known data and facts at the time of estimation.\n",
      "We consult with third party environmental litigation and engineering specialists, third party toxic tort claims professionals, third party clinical and public health specialists, third party workers’ compensation claims adjusters and third party actuarial advisors to help inform our judgments, as needed.\n",
      "A critical component of our detailed valuation reviews is a peer review of our reserving analyses and conclusions, where actuaries independent of the initial review evaluate the reasonableness of assumptions used, methods selected and weightings given to different methods. In addition, each detailed valuation review is subjected to a review and challenge process by specialists in our Enterprise Risk Management group.\n",

      "We consider key factors in performing detailed actuarial reviews, including:\n",
      "· an assessment of economic conditions including real GDP growth, inflation, employment rates or unemployment duration, stock market volatility and changes in corporate bond spreads;\n",
      "· changes in the legal, regulatory, judicial and social environment including changes in road safety, public health and cleanup standards;\n",

      "Actuarial and Other Methods for Major Lines of Business\n",
      "Our actuaries determine the most appropriate actuarial methods and segmentation. This determination is based on a variety of factors including the nature of the losses associated with the product line of business, such as the frequency or severity of the claims. In addition to determining the actuarial methods, the actuaries determine the appropriate loss reserve groupings of data. This determination is a judgmental, dynamic process and refinements to the groupings are made every year. The changes to groupings may be driven by and may change to reflect observed or emerging patterns within and across product lines, or to differentiate different risk characteristics (for example, size of deductibles and extent of third party claims specialists used by our insureds). As an example of reserve segmentation, we write many unique subsets of professional liability. For pricing or other purposes, it is appropriate to evaluate the profitability of each subset individually. However, for purposes of estimating the liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses for many product lines of business, we believe it is appropriate to combine the subsets into larger groups to produce a greater degree of credibility in the loss experience. This determination of data segmentation and related actuarial methods is assessed, reviewed and updated at least annually.\n",
      "The actuarial methods we use most commonly include paid and incurred loss development methods, expected loss ratio methods, including “Bornhuetter Ferguson” and “Cape Cod”, and frequency/severity models. Loss development methods utilize the actual loss development patterns from prior accident years updated through the current year to project the reported losses to an ultimate basis for all accident years. We also use this information to update our current accident year loss selections. Loss development methods are generally most appropriate for classes of business that exhibit a stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next, and for which the components of the product line have similar development characteristics. For example, property exposures would generally not be combined into the same product line as casualty exposures, and primary casualty exposures would generally not be combined into the same product line as excess casualty exposures. We continually refine our loss reserving techniques for the domestic primary casualty product line of business and adopt further segmentations based on our analysis of differing emerging loss patterns for certain product lines. We generally use expected loss ratio methods in cases where the reported loss data lacked sufficient credibility to utilize loss development methods, such as for new product lines of business or for long-tail product lines at early stages of loss development. Frequency/severity models may be used where sufficient frequency counts are available to apply such approaches.\n",
      "Expected loss ratio methods rely on the application of an expected loss ratio to the earned premium for the product line of business to determine the liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses. For example, an expected loss ratio of 70 percent applied to an earned premium base of $10 million for a product line of business would generate an ultimate loss estimate of $7 million. Subtracting any paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve for this product line. Under the Bornhuetter Ferguson methods, the expected loss ratio is applied only to the expected unreported portion of the losses. For example, for a long-tail product line of business for which only 10 percent of the losses are expected to be reported at the end of the accident year, the expected loss ratio would be used to represent the 90 percent of losses still unreported. The actual reported losses at the end of the accident year would be added to determine the total ultimate loss estimate for the accident year. Subtracting the reported paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve. In the example above, the expected loss ratio of 70 percent would be multiplied by 90 percent. The result of 63 percent would be applied to the earned premium of $10 million resulting in an estimated unreported loss of $6.3 million. Actual reported losses would be added to arrive at the total ultimate losses. If the reported losses were $1 million, the ultimate loss estimate under the Bornhuetter Ferguson method would be $7.3 million versus the $7 million amount under the expected loss ratio method described above. Thus, the Bornhuetter Ferguson method gives partial credibility to the actual loss experience to date for the product line of business. Loss development methods generally give full credibility to the reported\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K 43\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Critical Accounting Estimates\n",
      "loss experience to date. In the example above, loss development methods would typically indicate an ultimate loss estimate of $10 million, as the reported losses of $1 million would be estimated to reflect only 10 percent of the ultimate losses.\n",
      "A key advantage of loss development methods is that they respond more quickly to any actual changes in loss costs for the product line of business. Therefore, if loss experience is unexpectedly deteriorating or improving, the loss development method gives full credibility to the changing experience. Expected loss ratio methods would be slower to respond to the change, as they would continue to give more weight to a prior expected loss ratio, until enough evidence emerged to modify the expected loss ratio to reflect the changing loss experience. On the other hand, loss development methods have the disadvantage of overreacting to changes in reported losses if the loss experience is anomalous due to the various key factors described above and the inherent volatility in some of the classes. For example, the presence or absence of large losses at the early stages of loss development could cause the loss development method to overreact to the favorable or unfavorable experience by assuming it is a fundamental shift in the development pattern. In these instances, expected loss ratio methods such as Bornhuetter Ferguson have the advantage of recognizing large losses without extrapolating unusual large loss activity onto the unreported portion of the losses for the accident year.\n",
      "The Cape Cod method is a hybrid between the loss development and Bornhuetter Ferguson methods, where the historic loss data and loss development factor assumptions are used to determine the expected loss ratio estimate in the Bornhuetter Ferguson method.\n",
      "Frequency/severity methods generally rely on the determination of an ultimate number of claims and an average severity for each claim for each accident year. Multiplying the estimated ultimate number of claims for each accident year by the expected average severity of each claim produces the estimated ultimate loss for the accident year. Frequency/severity methods generally require a sufficient volume of claims in order for the average severity to be predictable. Average severity for subsequent accident years is generally determined by applying an estimated annual loss cost trend to the estimated average claim severity from prior accident years. In certain cases, a structural approach may also be used to predict the ultimate loss cost. Frequency/severity methods have the advantage that ultimate claim counts can generally be estimated more quickly and accurately than can ultimate losses. Thus, if the average claim severity can be accurately estimated, these methods can more quickly respond to changes in loss experience than other methods. However, for average severity to be predictable, the product line of business must consist of homogenous types of claims for which loss severity trends from one year to the next are reasonably consistent and where there are limited changes to deductible levels or limits. Generally these methods work best for high frequency, low severity product lines of business such as personal auto. However, frequency and severity metrics are also used to test the reasonability of results for other product lines of business and provide indications of underlying trends in the data. In addition, ultimate claim counts can be used as an alternative exposure measure to earned premiums in the Cape Cod method.\n",
      "Structural driver analytics seek to explain the underlying drivers of frequency/severity. A structural driver analysis of frequency/severity is particularly useful for understanding the key drivers of uncertainty in the ultimate loss cost. For example, for the excess workers’ compensation product line of business, we have attempted to corroborate our judgment by considering the impact on severity of the future potential for deterioration of an injured worker’s medical condition, the impact of price inflation on the various categories of medical expense and cost of living adjustments on indemnity benefits, the impact of injured worker mortality and claim specific settlement and loss mitigation strategies, etc., using the following:\n",

      "• Analysis of the potential for future deterioration in medical condition unlikely to be picked up by a claim file review and associated with potentially costly medical procedures (i.e., increases in both utilization and intensity of medical care) over the course of the injured worker’s lifetime;\n",
      "• Analysis of the cost of medical price inflation for each category of medical spend (services and devices) and for cost of living adjustments in line with statutory requirements;\n",
      "• Portfolio specific mortality level and mortality improvement assumptions based on a mortality study conducted for our primary and excess workers’ compensation portfolios and our opinion of future longevity trends for the open reported cases;\n",
      "• Ground-up consideration of the reinsurance recoveries expected for the product line of business for reported claims with extrapolation for unreported claims; and\n",
      "• The effects of various run-off loss management strategies that have been developed by our run-off unit.\n",

      "In recent years, we have expanded our analysis of structural drivers to additional product lines of business as a means of corroborating our judgments using traditional actuarial techniques. For example, we have explicitly used external estimates of future medical inflation and mortality in estimating the loss development tail for excess of deductible primary workers’ compensation business. Using external forecasts for items such as these can improve the accuracy and stability of our estimates.\n",
      "The estimation of liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental pollution losses on insurance policies written many years ago is typically subject to greater uncertainty than other types of losses. This is due to inconsistent court decisions, as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies or have expanded theories of liability. In addition, reinsurance recoverable balances relating to asbestos and environmental loss reserves are subject to greater uncertainty due to the underlying age of the claim, underlying legal issues surrounding the nature of the coverage, and determination of proper policy period. For these reasons, these balances tend to be subject to increased levels of disputes and legal collection activity when actually billed. The insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures.\n",
      "We continue to receive claims asserting injuries and damages from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged claims to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites, referred to collectively as environmental claims, and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. The vast majority of these asbestos and environmental losses emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained absolute exclusions for pollution-related damage and asbestos. The current environmental policies that we specifically price and underwrite for environmental risks on a claims-made basis have been excluded from the analysis.\n",
      "The majority of our exposures for asbestos and environmental losses are related to excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. The litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity amounts, with litigation expenses included within the limits of the liability we incur. Individual significant loss reserves, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case-by-case basis.\n",

U.S. Workers’ Compensation is a long-tail class of business, and our business reflects a very significant volume of losses, particularly in more recent accident years.\n",
      "The loss cost trend assumption is not believed to be material with respect to our loss reserves. This is primarily because our actuaries are generally able to use loss development projections for all but the most recent accident year’s reserves, so there is limited need to rely on loss cost trend assumptions for primary workers’ compensation business.\n",
      "The tail factor is typically the most critical assumption, and small changes in the selected tail factor can have a material effect on our carried reserves. For example, the tail factors beyond twenty years for guaranteed cost business could vary by one percent above or below those actually indicated in the 2016 loss reserve review. For excess of deductible business, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that tail factors beyond twenty years could vary by five percent above or below those actually indicated in the 2016 loss reserve review.\n",

      "Key Assumptions\n",
      "U.S. Excess Casualty\n",
      "We utilize various loss cost trend assumptions for different segments of the portfolio. After evaluating the historical loss cost trends from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss cost trends applicable to the year-end 2016 loss reserve review for U.S. Excess Casualty may range five percent lower or higher than this estimated loss trend. The loss cost trend assumption is critical for the U.S. Excess Casualty class of business due to the long-tail nature of the losses, and is applied across many accident years. Thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years (the expected loss ratio years) to be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends that were initially relied upon in setting the loss reserves. These changes in loss trends could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.\n",
      "U.S. Excess Casualty is a long-tail class of business and any deviation in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. Mass tort claims in particular may develop over a very extended period and impact multiple accident years, so we usually select a separate pattern for them. Thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years to be significantly affected by changes in loss development factors that were initially relied upon in setting the reserves.\n",
      "After evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the actual loss development factors could vary by an amount equivalent to a six month shift from those actually utilized in the year-end 2016 reserve review. This would impact projections both for accident years where the selections were directly based on loss development methods as well as the a priori loss ratio assumptions for accident years with selections based on Bornhuetter-Ferguson or Cape Cod methods. Similar to loss cost trends, these changes in loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.\n",
      "U.S. Other Casualty\n",
      "The key uncertainties for other casualty lines are similar to excess casualty, as the underlying business is long-tailed and can be subject to variability in loss cost trends and changes in loss development factors. These may differ significantly by line of business as coverages such as general liability, medical malpractice and environmental may be subject to different risk drivers.\n",
      "U.S. Financial Lines\n",
      "The loss cost trends for U.S. D&O business vary by year and subset, but for the most recent accident years, it is assumed to have been generally close to zero. After evaluating the historical loss cost levels from prior accident years since the early 1990s, including the potential effect of losses relating to the credit crisis, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the actual variation in loss cost levels for these subsets could vary by approximately 15 percent lower or higher on a year-over-year basis than the assumptions actually utilized in the year-end 2016 reserve review. Because U.S. D&O business has exhibited highly volatile loss trends from one accident year to the next, there is the possibility of an exceptionally high deviation. In our analysis, the effects of loss cost trend assumptions affect the results through the a priori loss ratio assumptions used for the Bornhuetter-Ferguson and Cape Cod methods, which impact the projections for the two most recent two accident years.\n",
      "The assumed loss development factors are also an important assumption, but are less critical than for U.S. Excess Casualty. Because these classes are written on a claims made basis, the loss reporting and development tail is much shorter than for U.S. Excess Casualty. However, the high severity nature of the losses does create the potential for significant deviations in loss development patterns from one year to the next. Similar to Excess Casualty, after evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss development factors could change by an amount equivalent to a shift by six months from those actually utilized in the year-end 2016 reserve review.\n",
      "Europe Casualty and Financial Lines\n",
      "Similar to U.S. business, European Casualty and Financial Lines can be significantly impacted by loss cost trends and changes in loss development factors. The variation in such factors can differ significantly by product and region.\n",
      "U.S. and Europe Property and Special Risks\n",
      "For short-tail lines such as Property and Special Risks, variance in outcomes for individual large claims or events can have a significant impact on results. These outcomes generally relate to unique characteristics of events such as catastrophes or losses with significant business interruption claims.\n",
      "U.S., Europe, and Japan Personal Insurance\n",
      "Personal Insurance is short -tailed in nature similar to Property and Special Risks but less volatile. Variance in estimates can result from unique events such as catastrophes. In addition, some subsets of this business, such as auto liability, can be impacted by changes in loss development factors and loss cost trends.\n",

      "Key Assumptions\n",
      "U.S. Run-off Long Tail Insurance lines\n",
      "We historically have used a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for excess workers’ compensation and other run-off segments. For environmental claims, we have utilized a variety of methods including traditional loss development approaches, claim department and other expert evaluations of the ultimate costs for certain claims and survival ratio metrics.\n",
      "U.S. Run-off Long Tail Insurance lines is an extremely long-tail class of business, with a much greater than normal uncertainty as to the appropriate loss development factors for the tail of the loss development. Specifically for excess workers’ compensation, after evaluating the historical loss development factors for prior accident years since the 1980s as well as the development over the past several years of the ground up loss projections utilized to help select the loss development factors in the tail for this class of business, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the tail factor beyond 30 years could vary by 10 percent above or below that actually indicated in the 2016 loss reserve review.\n",
      "Other Reserve Items\n",
      "Loss adjustment expenses (LAE) are separated into two broad categories, allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE), also referred to as legal defense and cost containment or “legal” and unallocated loss adjustment expenses (ULAE), which includes certain claims adjuster fees and other internal claim management costs.\n",
      "We determine loss adjustment expenses reserves for legal expenses for each class of business by one or more actuarial or structural driver methods. For the majority of segments, legal costs are analyzed in conjunction with losses. For segments where they are separately analyzed the methods used generally include development methods comparable to those described for loss development methods. The development could be based on either the paid loss adjustment expenses or the ratio of paid loss adjustment expenses to paid losses, or both. Other methods include the utilization of expected ultimate ratios of paid loss expense to paid losses, based on actual experience from prior accident years or from similar product lines of business.\n",
      "The bulk of adjuster expenses are allocated and charged to individual claim files. For these expenses, we generally determine reserves based on calendar year ratios of adjuster expenses paid to losses paid for the particular product line of business. For other internal claim costs, which generally relate to specific claim department expenses that are not specifically allocated to claim files such as technology costs and other broad initiatives, we look at historic and expected expenditures for these items and project these into the future.\n",
      "The incidence of LAE are directly related to the frequency, complexity and level of underlying claims. As a result, key drivers of variability in LAE is the variability in the overall claims, particularly for long tail lines.\n",
      "The following sensitivity analysis table summarizes the effect on the loss reserve position of using certain alternative loss cost trend (for accident years where we use expected loss ratio methods) or loss development factor assumptions rather than the assumptions actually used in determining our estimates in the year-end loss reserve analyses in 2016.\n",

      "Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health Insurance Contracts\n",
      "Long-duration traditional products include whole life insurance, term life insurance, accident and health insurance, long-term care insurance, and certain payout annuities for which the payment period is life-contingent, which include certain of our single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements.\n",
      "For long-duration traditional business, a “lock-in” principle applies. The assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. The assumptions include mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses, and investment returns. These assumptions are typically consistent with pricing inputs. The assumptions also include margins for adverse deviation, principally for key assumptions such as mortality and interest rates used to discount cash flows, to reflect uncertainty given that actual experience might deviate from these assumptions. Establishing margins at contract inception requires management judgment. The extent of the margin for adverse deviation may vary depending on the uncertainty of the cash flows, which is affected by the volatility of the business and the extent of our experience with the product.\n",
      "Loss recognition occurs if observed changes in actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses under loss recognition testing. To determine whether loss recognition exists, we determine whether a future loss is expected based on updated current assumptions. If loss recognition exists, we recognize the loss by first reducing DAC through amortization expense, and, if DAC is depleted, record additional liabilities through a charge to policyholder benefit expense. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on loss recognition. Because of the long-term nature of many of our liabilities subject to the “lock-in” principle, small changes in certain assumptions may cause large changes in the degree of reserve adequacy. In particular, changes in estimates of future invested asset returns have a large effect on the degree of reserve deficiency.\n",
      "Groupings for loss recognition testing are consistent with our manner of acquiring, servicing, and measuring the profitability of the business and are applied by product groupings. We perform separate loss recognition tests for traditional life products, payout annuities, and long-term care insurance. Once loss recognition has been recorded for a block of business, the old assumption set is replaced and the assumption set used for the loss recognition would then be subject to the lock-in principle. Key judgments made in loss recognition testing include the following:\n",
      "• To determine investment returns used in loss recognition tests, we typically segregate assets that match the duration of our liabilities with assets of comparable duration, to the extent practicable, and then project future cash flows on those assets. Assets supporting insurance liabilities are primarily comprised of a diversified portfolio of high quality fixed maturity securities, and may also include, to a lesser extent, alternative investments. Our projections include a reasonable allowance for investment expenses and expected credit losses over the projection horizon. A critical assumption in the projection of expected investment income is the assumed net rate of investment return at which excess cash flows are to be reinvested. For products in which asset and liability durations are matched relatively well, this is less of a consideration since interest on excess cash flows are not a significant component of future cash flows. For the reinvestment rate assumption, anticipated future changes to the yield curves could have a large effect. Given the interest rate environment applicable at the date of our most recent loss recognition tests, we assumed a modest and gradual increase in long-term interest rates over time.\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K 48\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Critical Accounting Estimates\n",
      "• For mortality assumptions, key judgments include the extent of industry versus own experience to base future assumptions as well as the extent of expected mortality improvements in the future. The latter judgment is based on a combination of historical mortality trends and advice from industry, public health and demography specialists that were consulted by AIG’s actuaries and published industry information.\n",
      "• For surrender rates, a key judgment involves the correlation between expected increases/decreases in interest rates and increases/decreases in surrender rates. To support this judgment, we compare crediting rates on our products relative to expected rates on competing products under different interest rate scenarios.\n",
      "• For in-force long-term care insurance, rate increases are allowed but must be approved by state insurance regulators. Consequently, the extent of rate increases that may be assumed requires judgment. In establishing our assumption for rate increases for long-term care insurance, we consider historical experience as to the frequency and level of rate increases approved by state regulators.\n",
      "Significant unrealized appreciation on investments in a prolonged low interest rate environment may cause DAC to be adjusted and additional future policy benefit liabilities to be recorded through a charge directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (“shadow loss recognition”). These charges are included, net of tax, with the change in net unrealized appreciation of investments. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on shadow loss recognition. In applying shadow loss recognition, the Company overlays unrealized gains onto loss recognition tests without revising the underlying test. Accordingly, there is limited additional judgment in this process.\n",
      "Guaranteed Benefit Features of Variable Annuity Products\n",
      "Variable annuity products offered by our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement product lines offer guaranteed benefit features. These guaranteed features include guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) that are payable in the event of death or other instances, and living benefits that are payable in the event of annuitization, or, in other instances, at specified dates during the accumulation period. Living benefits include guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB) and guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB). See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these features.\n",
      "The liabilities for GMDB and GMIB, which are recorded in Future policyholder benefits, represent the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account value, with the excess recognized ratably through Policyholder benefits and losses incurred over the accumulation period based on total expected fee assessments. The liabilities for GMWB, which are recorded in Policyholder contract deposits, are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value of the liabilities recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses).\n",
      "Our exposure to the guaranteed amounts is equal to the amount by which the contract holder’s account balance is below the amount provided by the guaranteed feature. A variable annuity contract may include more than one type of guaranteed benefit feature; for example, it may have both a GMDB and a GMWB. However, a policyholder can generally only receive payout from one guaranteed feature on a contract containing a death benefit and a living benefit, i.e. the features are generally mutually exclusive, so the exposure to the guaranteed amount for each feature is independent of the exposure from other features (except a surviving spouse who has a rider to potentially collect both a GMDB upon their spouse’s death and a GMWB during his or her lifetime). A policyholder cannot purchase more than one living benefit on one contract. Declines in the equity markets, increased volatility and a sustained low interest rate environment increase our exposure to potential benefits under the guaranteed features, leading to an increase in the liabilities for those benefits. See Estimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products (Life Insurance Companies) below for sensitivity analysis which includes the sensitivity of reserves for guaranteed benefit features to changes in the assumptions for interest rates, equity market returns, volatility, and mortality.

See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on how we reserve for variable annuity products with guaranteed benefit features.\n",

      "• Interest rates, which vary by year of issuance and products\n",
      "• Mortality rates, which are based upon actual experience modified to allow for variations in policy form\n",

      "GMWB\n",
      "GMWB living benefits are embedded derivatives that are required to be bifurcated from the host contract and carried at fair value. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on how we reserve for variable annuity products with guaranteed benefit features, and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on fair value measurement of these embedded derivatives, including how we incorporate our own non-performance risk.\n",

      "• Interest rates\n",
      "• Equity market returns\n",

      "• Allocation of fees between the embedded derivative and host contract.\n",
      "Estimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products\n",
      "Policy acquisition costs and policy issuance costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal of existing insurance contracts related to universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) are generally deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over a period that approximates the estimated lives of the contracts, except in instances where significant negative gross profits are expected in one or more periods. Estimated gross profits include net investment income and spreads, net realized capital gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses, and mortality gains and losses. In estimating future gross profits, lapse assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on DAC amortization. For fixed deferred annuity contracts, the future spread between investment income and interest credited to policyholders is a significant judgment, particularly in a low interest rate environment.\n",
      "If the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC and related reserves, including VOBA, SIA, guaranteed benefit reserves and unearned revenue reserve (URR), are recalculated using the new assumptions, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. Updating such assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.\n",
      "In estimating future gross profits for variable annuity products as of December 31, 2016, a long-term annual asset growth assumption of 7.5 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected) was applied to estimate the future growth in assets and related asset-based fees. In determining the asset growth rate, the effect of short-term fluctuations in the equity markets is partially mitigated through the use of a reversion to the mean methodology, whereby short-term asset growth above or\n",

      "below the long-term annual rate assumption impacts the growth assumption applied to the five-year period subsequent to the current balance sheet date. The reversion to the mean methodology allows us to maintain our long-term growth assumptions, while also giving consideration to the effect of actual investment performance. When actual performance significantly deviates from the annual long-term growth assumption, as evidenced by growth assumptions for the five-year reversion to the mean period falling below a certain rate (floor) or above a certain rate (cap) for a sustained period, judgment may be applied to revise or “unlock” the growth rate assumptions to be used for both the five-year reversion to the mean period as well as the long-term annual growth assumption applied to subsequent periods. The use of a reversion to the mean assumption is common within the industry; however, the parameters used in the methodology are subject to judgment and vary within the industry. See Insurance Reserves - Life and Annuity Reserves and DAC - Reversion to the Mean for additional discussion.\n",
      "The following table summarizes the sensitivity of changes in certain assumptions for DAC and SIA, embedded derivatives and other reserves related to guaranteed benefits and URR, measured as the related hypothetical impact on December 31, 2016 balances and the resulting hypothetical impact on pre-tax income, before hedging.\n",

      "• In August 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our 100 percent interest in United Guaranty Corporation (UGC) and certain related companies to Arch Capital Group Ltd. (Arch). The sale of UGC and its subsidiaries closed on December 31, 2016, and we received proceeds of approximately $3.3 billion. Concurrent with the closing, we entered into reinsurance agreements with Arch, including an amended and restated 50 percent quota share reinsurance agreement and an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement, pursuant to which we will continue to be exposed to certain UGC policies written between 2009 and 2016. We expect the results of these reinsurance arrangements to continue to be reported in Commercial Insurance.\n",
      "• In August 2016, we sold our controlling interest in NSM, a managing general agent, to ABRY Partners for consideration of $201 million. We retained an equity interest in a newly formed joint venture and we continue to provide underwriting capacity to NSM.\n",
      "• In September 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our 20 percent interest in Ascot Underwriting Holdings Ltd. and our 100 percent interest in the related syndicate-funding subsidiary Ascot Corporate Name Ltd. to Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB). Total consideration for the transaction was $1.1 billion, inclusive of CPPIB’s recapitalization of Syndicate 1414’s Funds at Lloyd’s (FAL) capital requirements. The transaction closed on November 18, 2016, and we received approximately $244 million in net cash proceeds.\n",
      "• On November 17, 2016, an AIG sponsored Fund (the Korea Fund), completed the sale of a mixed-use commercial complex in Seoul, South Korea commonly known as the Seoul International Finance Center to Brookfield Properties for a total consideration of $2.5 billion, of which $1.2 billion was used to repay the fund’s debt. The remaining cash proceeds were allocated between AIG and the noncontrolling interests in accordance with the Korea Fund’s partnership agreement.\n",
      "• On December 30, 2016, we sold a portion of our life settlements portfolio with face value (death benefits) of approximately $4.5 billion, which was 30 percent of the face value of the life settlements portfolio. As of December 31, 2016, our life settlements portfolio carrying value was $2.5 billion, with a face value (death benefits) of $9.8 billion.\n",
      "Pending Divestitures\n",
      "• In October 2016, we entered into an agreement with Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited (Fairfax), as part of a strategic partnership that we believe will further focus and streamline our global insurance operations. We agreed to sell to Fairfax our country subsidiary operations in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay, Venezuela, as well as insurance operations in Turkey. Fairfax will also acquire renewal rights for the portfolios of local business written by our operations in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia, and assume certain of our operating assets and employees.

      "Reinsurance Transactions\n",
      "• Effective January 1, 2016, we entered into a two-year reinsurance arrangement with the Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd., under which we ceded a proportional share of our new and renewal U.S. Casualty portfolio.\n",
      "• Effective July 1, 2016, we entered into a reinsurance agreement with Hannover Life Reassurance Company of America, involving certain whole life and universal life businesses of one of our domestic life insurance subsidiaries. This transaction uses deposit accounting for purposes of U.S. GAAP, reduced certain statutory reserves that were above economic requirements, which released excess statutory capital of approximately $1.0 billion that was included in 2016 dividend payments to AIG Parent.\n",
      "• Effective December 31, 2016, our domestic life insurance subsidiary amended the July 1, 2016 reinsurance agreement discussed above to also cede certain statutory reserves for term and universal life products that are above economic requirements, which were previously managed through affiliated reinsurance. This transaction is expected to result in a tax sharing payment by the Life Insurance Companies to AIG Parent in 2017.\n",
      "• Our catastrophe reinsurance program includes coverage for natural catastrophes and some coverage for terrorism events. It consists of a large North American occurrence cover (without reinstatement) to protect against large North America losses, and Japan covers to protect against losses in Japan. Effective January 1, 2017, the attachment point for this reinsurance program is at $1.5 billion for the North American cover ($3 billion in 2016) and varies for the Japan covers. The North American cover has reduced the U.S. Hurricane (1-in-100) OEP net of reinsurance from $3.1 billion under the 2016 reinsurance program to $2.0 billion under the 2017 program.\n",
      "• In January 2017, we announced that we have entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with National Indemnity Company (NICO), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., under which we transferred to NICO 80 percent of reserve risk on substantially all of our U.S. Commercial long-tail exposures for accident years 2015 and prior. Under this agreement, we ceded to NICO 80 percent of net paid losses on subject business on or after January 1, 2016 in excess of $25 billion of net paid losses, up to an aggregate limit of $25 billion. At NICO’s 80 percent share, NICO’s limit of liability under the contract is $20 billion. We will account for this transaction as retroactive reinsurance. The consideration for this agreement is $9.8 billion plus interest at four percent per annum from January 1, 2016 to the date of payment, which was paid in full as of February 17, 2017. The consideration paid to NICO will be placed into a collateral trust account as security for NICO’s claim payment obligations, and Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. has provided a parental guarantee to secure NICO’s obligations under the agreement.\n",

      "Our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit and equity market conditions, catastrophic claims events, regulation, tax policy, competition, and general economic, market and political conditions. We continued to operate under difficult market conditions in 2016, characterized by factors such as historically low interest rates, instability in the global equity markets, volatile energy markets, slowing growth in China and Euro-Zone economies, and the United Kingdom (the UK) advisory referendum in which a majority voted for the UK to withdraw its membership in the European Union (the EU) (commonly referred to as Brexit). The Brexit vote has also affected the U.S. dollar/British pound exchange rate, increased the volatility of exchange rates among the euro, British pound and the Japanese yen (the Major Currencies), and created volatility in the financial markets, which may continue for some time.\n",
      "Impact of Changes in the Interest Rate Environment\n",
      "Interest rates increased late in 2016, but have remained at historically low levels. Certain markets in which we operate have experienced negative interest rates. A sustained low interest rate environment negatively affects sales of interest rate sensitive products in our industry and may negatively impact the profitability of our existing business as we reinvest cash flows from investments, including increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolios. We actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through asset-liability management including spread management strategies for our investment-oriented products and economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable and fixed index annuities.\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K 59\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Executive Summary\n",
      "Annuity Sales and Surrenders\n",
      "The sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry. Low long-term interest rates put pressure on investment returns, which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products. However, our disciplined rate setting has helped to mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. As long as the low interest rate environment continues, conditions will be challenging for the fixed annuity market. Rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased sales, but may also drive higher surrenders. Customers are, however, currently buying fixed annuities with longer surrender periods in pursuit of higher returns, which may help mitigate the rate of increase in surrenders in a rapidly rising rate environment. In addition, older contracts that have higher minimum interest rates and continue to be attractive to the contract holders are driving better than expected persistency, although the reserves for such contracts have continued to decrease over time in amount and as a percentage of the total annuity portfolio. Low interest rates have also driven growth in our fixed index annuity products, which provide additional interest crediting tied to favorable performance in certain equity market indices and the availability of guaranteed living benefits. Changes in interest rates significantly impact the valuation of our liabilities for guaranteed products with income features and the value of the related hedging portfolio.\n",
      "Reinvestment and Spread Management\n",
      "We actively monitor fixed income markets, including the level of interest rates, credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve. We also frequently review our interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for new and in-force business. Business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a historically low interest rate environment. The low interest rate environment makes it more difficult to profitably price many of our products and puts margin pressure on existing products, due to the challenge of investing recurring premiums and deposits and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows in the low rate environment while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity. In addition, there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain in-force business. Specifically, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities.\n",
      "The contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in products may reduce spreads in a sustained low interest rate environment and thus reduce future profitability. Although this interest rate risk is partially mitigated through the asset-liability management process, product design elements and crediting rate strategies, a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability.\n",
      "The following table presents Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement base net investment spread:\n",
      "In Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement, average interest crediting rates decreased slightly in 2016 and 2015 compared to the preceding years due to active crediting rate management. However, the decline in base investment yields, driven by investment purchases and investment of portfolio cash flows at rates below the weighted average yield of the existing portfolio in the sustained low interest rate environment, resulted in base spread compression. See Investments for additional information on our investment and asset-liability management strategies.\n",
      "For investment-oriented products in our Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance and Institutional Markets businesses, our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business, modifying or limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads, using asset-liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable, and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. Renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals in accordance with state and federal laws and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. We will continue to adjust crediting rates on in-force business to mitigate the pressure on spreads from declining base yields, but our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by the competitive environment, contractual minimum crediting rates, and provisions that allow rates to be reset only at pre-established intervals. For example, competitors including private equity-held annuity writers are currently offering higher crediting rates. As a result, the timing and extent of crediting rate decreases may differ from the corresponding declines in investment yields, which could reduce our spreads and future profitability.\n",
      "As shown in the table below, 73 percent of the fixed account values of our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement annuity products in the aggregate were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at December 31, 2016. As a result of disciplined pricing on new business and the run-off of older business with higher crediting rates, the percentage of fixed account values of our annuity products that are currently crediting at rates above one percent decreased to 70 percent at December 31, 2016,\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Executive Summary\n",
      "compared to 74 percent at December 31, 2015 and 79 percent at December 31, 2014. These businesses continue to focus on pricing discipline and strategies to reduce the minimum guaranteed interest crediting rates offered on new sales. In the Core universal life business in our Life Insurance segment, 70 percent of the account values were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at December 31, 2016.\n",

      "* Individual Retirement and Group Retirement amounts shown include fixed options within variable annuity products.\n",
      "Assumption Updates and Loss Recognition\n",
      "Spreads and surrender rates are important components of the future profit assumptions that drive the rate we use to amortize DAC and related reserves for investment-oriented products. If future profit assumptions change significantly, we may be required to recalculate DAC and related reserves, and reflect any resulting adjustments in current period income. In addition to investment-oriented products, certain traditional long-duration products for which we do not have the ability to adjust interest rates, such as structured settlements and payout annuities, are exposed to reduced earnings and potential loss recognition reserve increases in a sustained low interest rate environment. See Insurance Reserves - Life and Annuity Reserves and DAC - Update of Actuarial Assumptions for discussion of such adjustments recorded in 2016, 2015 and 2014 in our Consumer Insurance and Legacy Life Insurance Run-Off Lines.\n",
      "Commercial Insurance\n",
      "The impact of low interest rates on our Commercial Insurance segment is primarily on our long-tail Casualty line of business. We expect limited impacts on our existing long-tail Casualty business as the duration of our assets is slightly longer than that of our liabilities. We do expect sustained low interest rates will impact new and renewal business for the long-tail Casualty line as we may\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K 61\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Executive Summary\n",
      "not be able to adjust our future pricing consistent with our profitability objectives to fully offset the impact of investing at lower rates. However, we will continue to maintain pricing discipline and risk selection.\n",
      "In addition, for our Commercial Insurance segment and run-off insurance lines reported within the Legacy Portfolio, sustained low interest rates may unfavorably affect the net loss reserve discount for workers’ compensation, and to a lesser extent could favorably impact assumptions about future medical costs; the combined net effect of which could result in higher net loss reserves.\n",
      "Additionally, sustained low interest rates on discounting of projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans may result in higher pension expense.\n",
      "Department of Labor Fiduciary Rule\n",
      "Our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement operating segments provide products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, including the requirements of the DOL Fiduciary Rule. For additional information about the DOL Fiduciary Rule, see Part I, Item 1. Business - Regulation. We have been analyzing the DOL Fiduciary Rule’s potential impact on our customers, distribution partners, financial advisors and our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement businesses, and preparing to implement the necessary adjustments to achieve compliance with the DOL Fiduciary Rule. Overall, the DOL Fiduciary Rule as currently promulgated would result in increased compliance costs and, as currently promulgated, may create increased exposure to legal claims under certain circumstances, including class actions. The DOL has also issued interpretive guidance on the DOL Fiduciary Rule, and we are evaluating whether or not this guidance would affect the actions we would need to take to comply with the DOL Fiduciary Rule.\n",
      "On February 3, 2017, the new administration issued a memo requiring the DOL to review the DOL Fiduciary Rule and determine whether the DOL Fiduciary Rule will adversely impact the ability of retirement savers to access information and financial advice. Accordingly, the DOL announced that it would consider legal options for postponing the applicability date of the DOL Fiduciary Rule while the DOL considers the issues raised in the referenced memo. We are closely following the DOL’s pronouncements about further delays to the DOL Fiduciary Rule’s effective date.\n",
      "Impact of Currency Volatility\n",
      "Currency volatility in 2016 and 2015 was acute compared to recent years, as the British pound weakened considerably against the U.S. dollar in 2016, although the Japanese yen strengthened against the U.S. dollar. The euro also weakened modestly against the U.S. dollar. Such volatility affected line item components of income for those businesses with substantial international operations. In particular, growth trends in net premiums written reported in U.S. dollars can differ significantly from those measured in original currencies. The net effect on underwriting results, however, is significantly mitigated, as both revenues and expenses are similarly affected.\n",
      "These currencies may continue to fluctuate, in either direction, especially as a result of the UK’s expected exit from the EU, and such fluctuations will affect net premiums written growth trends reported in U.S. dollars, as well as financial statement line item comparability.\n",

These earnings relate to ongoing operations and have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. Further, we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund U.S. operations. As a result, U.S. deferred taxes have not been provided on $2 billion of accumulated earnings, including accumulated other comprehensive income, of these non-U.S. affiliates. Potential U.S. income tax liabilities related to such earnings would be offset, in whole or in part, by allowable foreign tax credits resulting from foreign taxes paid to foreign jurisdictions in which such operations are located. As a result, we currently believe that any incremental U.S. income tax liabilities relating to indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings would not be significant.

      "COMPETITION and challenges\n",
      "Operating in a highly competitive industry, Commercial Insurance competes against several hundred companies, specialty insurance organizations, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations in the U.S. In international markets, we compete for business with the foreign insurance operations of large global insurance groups and local companies in specific market areas and product types. Insurance companies compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product pricing, service and terms and conditions. Commercial Insurance seeks to distinguish itself in the insurance industry primarily based on its well-established brand, global franchise, multinational capabilities, financial and capital strength, innovative products, claims expertise to handle complex claims, expertise in providing specialized coverages and customer service.\n",
      "We serve our business and individual customers on a global basis - from the largest multinational corporations to local businesses and individuals. Our clients benefit from our substantial underwriting expertise.\n",
      "Our challenges include:\n",
      "• information technology infrastructure modernization, which puts pressure on our efforts to reduce operating expenses;\n",
      "• long-tail exposures create added challenges to pricing and risk management;\n",
      "• over capacity in certain lines of business creates downward market pressure on pricing;\n",
      "• tort environment volatility in certain jurisdictions and lines of business; and\n",
      "• volatility in claims arising from natural and man-made catastrophes.\n",
      "OUTLOOK-INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC FACTORS\n",
      "Below is a discussion of the industry and economic factors impacting our specific business:\n",
      "Liability and Financial Lines\n",
      "We have observed an increase in frequency of severity of losses, particularly in Auto, which is impacting not only the primary books, but also having leverage impacts on excess layers. Loss cost trend rates across U.S. casualty lines in general are increasing with the exception of U.S. workers’ compensation. The market is still challenging in terms of the level of capacity, which is continuing to impact the rate environment. The overall rates we have achieved have been positive across most business lines (in particular in auto where we have seen a large number of double digit increases as we have remediated underpriced business through a combination of product exits and use of reinsurance). The current accident year deterioration has seen partial offsets as a result of actions taken in 2016 to grow higher value lines such as M&A and Cyber.\n",
      "Liability and Financial Lines has large international exposure within the total Commercial Insurance portfolio and will therefore remain sensitive to volatility in foreign currencies.\n",
      "Property and Special Risks\n",
      "In 2016, Property and Special Risks experienced growth in certain strategic high value businesses that led to positive results that met or exceeded our expectations, including U.S. middle market property, and we expect such growth to continue in 2017. The U.S. large limit property business continues to be a profitable investment area, and remains at volumes consistent with 2015. Property and Special Risks also expects that expansion in certain growth economies will continue at a faster pace than in developed countries, but at levels lower than those previously expected due to revised economic assumptions. Rates in more commoditized lines of business such as U.S. Excess and Surplus lines continue to be unsatisfactory and we intend to continue to reduce our net premiums written in these areas.\n",
      "Overall, Property and Special Risks experienced rate pressure in 2016, which is expected to continue in the near term, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Property and Special Risks continues to differentiate its underwriting capacity from its peers by leveraging its global footprint, diverse product offering, risk engineering expertise and significant underwriting experience.\n",
      "Primarily due to reductions in the Property portfolio driven by actions to address accounts with inadequate price and/or terms and conditions, catastrophe exposures have declined.\n",

      "Business and Financial Highlights\n",
      "The net premiums written decrease in 2016 was driven by the Swiss Re quota share treaty, portfolio optimization and execution on our pricing strategy, partially offset by growth in targeted lines of business. The increase in net losses was driven by net adverse prior year reserve development. The acquisition expense decrease was primarily related to the 2016 Swiss Re quota share treaty. The general operating expense decrease was driven by lower employee-related expenses and other expense savings initiatives. Lower net investment income was driven primarily by lower alternative investment returns due to weaker performance in equity markets compared to prior years.\n",
      "We continue to reduce the relative size of our U.S. casualty portfolio within Liability and Financial Lines and consequently expect that net premiums written will continue to decline through 2017, in large part driven by the impact of our continued strategy on risk selection, disciplined underwriting and execution of our reinsurance strategy to further reduce risk.\n",
      "As discussed in the Executive Summary, in January 2017, we entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO, which covers 80 percent of up to $9 billion of potential future prior year development on substantially all of our U.S. Casualty and Financial Lines exposures for accident years 2015 and prior. Under U.S. GAAP, any potential future prior year development would be recognized immediately as losses are incurred; however, the related recoveries under the reinsurance agreement would be deferred and recognized over the expected recovery period.\n",

      "Increasing life expectancy and reduced expectations for traditional retirement income from defined benefit programs and fixed income securities are leading Americans to seek additional financial security as they approach retirement. The strong demand for individual variable and fixed index annuities with guaranteed income features has attracted increased competition in this product space. In response to the continued low interest rate environment, which has added pressure to profit margins, we have developed guaranteed income benefits for both variable and fixed index annuities with margins that are less sensitive to the level of interest rates.\n",
      "Changes in the interest rate environment have a significant impact on sales, surrender rates, investment returns, guaranteed income features, and spreads in the annuity industry. See AIG’s Outlook - Industry and Economic Factors - Changes in the Interest Rate Environment for additional discussion of the impact of market interest rate movement on our Individual Retirement business.\n",
      "Individual Retirement provides products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to the requirements of the DOL Fiduciary Rule. For additional information on the DOL Fiduciary Rule, including the recent decision by the new administration to request a further review of the DOL Fiduciary Rule, see Part I, Item 1.

      "Group Retirement\n",
      "Group Retirement competes in the defined contribution market under its VALIC brand. VALIC is a leading retirement plan provider in the U.S. for K-12 schools and school districts, higher education, healthcare, government and other not-for-profit institutions. The defined contribution market is a highly efficient and competitive market that requires support for both plan sponsors and individual participants. To meet this challenge, VALIC is investing in a client-focused technology platform to support improved compliance and self-service functionality. VALIC’s service model pairs self-service tools with its career financial advisors who provide individual plan participants with enrollment support and comprehensive financial planning services.\n",

      "Life Insurance\n",
      "Consumers have increased needs for financial protection for beneficiaries, estate planning and wealth creation. Life Insurance addresses the need for protection against the risk of premature death through a broad spectrum of products that include both term and permanent life insurance. In addition, Life Insurance offers products and benefits that offset other risks such as chronic and critical illness.\n",
      "In response to a sustained low interest rate environment, Life Insurance has been actively re-pricing products and shifting its focus away from products with long-duration interest rate guarantees by introducing new products with shorter guarantees as well as indexed universal life products. See AIG’s Outlook -Industry and Economic Factors - Changes in the Interest Rate Environment for additional discussion of the impact of market interest rate movement on our Life Insurance business.\n",
      "Personal Insurance\n",
      "The need for full life cycle products and coverage, increases in personal wealth accumulation, and awareness of insurance protection and risk management continue to support the growth of the Personal Insurance industry. Personal Insurance focuses on group and corporate clients, together with individual customers within national markets. We expect the demand for multinational cross-border coverage and services to increase due to the internationalization of clients and customers. We believe our global presence provides Personal Insurance a distinct competitive advantage.\n",
      "In Japan, the competition for auto insurance has intensified, in part driven by a decline in new car sales and the existence of fewer but larger insurers. In addition, the overall market size in homeowners insurance contracted after the duration restriction on long-term fire insurance became effective in October 2015. In the U.S., we compete in the high net worth market and will continue to expand our innovative products and services to distribution partners and clients. Outside of Japan and the U.S., our Personal Insurance module continues to invest selectively in markets, which we believe have higher potential for sustainable profitability.\n",

      "The Individual Retirement, Group Retirement and Life Insurance modules review and update estimated gross profit assumptions used to amortize deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) and related items for investment-oriented products, as well as other actuarial assumptions, at least annually. As a result, the pre-tax operating earnings of these businesses include adjustments to policy fees, policyholder benefits, interest credited and DAC amortization to reflect such assumption updates, which may be significant. See Insurance Reserves - Life and Annuity Reserves and DAC - Update of Actuarial Assumptions for the amount of adjustments recorded to reflect such assumption updates in 2016, 2015 and 2014 by product line and financial statement line item and for related discussion of the assumption changes that resulted in these adjustments.\n",

      "Business and Financial Highlights\n",
      "A diverse product portfolio enabled Individual Retirement to maintain industry-leading positions in annuity sales despite a challenging environment, which included an industry-wide slowdown primarily driven by uncertainty about the DOL Fiduciary Rule, compared to strong Variable and Index Annuity sales growth in 2015 and 2014. Our total sales of Index Annuities slowed in 2016 but continued to outpace the industry. Fixed Annuities sales increased in 2016 as customers chose the safety of fixed returns in a period of equity volatility, but the sustained low interest rate environment, together with aggressive pricing by private equity-backed annuity writers, resulted in a modest decline in market share in 2016 and negative net flows for Fixed Annuities in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Reinvestment in the low interest rate environment contributed to spread compression in Fixed Annuities, and net investment income results included volatility from alternative investments, mortgage loan prepayments, and fair value option assets. Pre-tax operating income also included adjustments in each year to update actuarial assumptions, particularly from lower surrenders across all product lines. Excluding such adjustments, net growth in average assets for Variable and Index Annuities drove higher fee income, partially offset by increased DAC amortization. The sale of AIG Advisor Group in May 2016 resulted in decreases in advisory fee income, advisory fee expense and general operating expenses in 2016 compared to 2015, but did not result in a significant decrease in pre-tax operating income.\n",

For Variable and Index Annuities, the increase in reserves with higher surrender charges during these periods was due to positive net flows from these product lines during 2016.

Approximately $6 billion came from external sales and internal securitizations of Legacy Investments to the insurance companies. The most significant transactions in 2016 were as follows:\n",
      "• On November 17, 2016, an AIG sponsored Fund (the Korea Fund) completed the sale of a mixed-use commercial complex in Seoul, South Korea commonly known as the Seoul International Finance Center, to Brookfield Properties for total consideration of $2.5 billion, of which $1.2 billion was used to repay the fund’s debt. The remaining cash proceeds were allocated between AIG and the noncontrolling interests in accordance with the Korea Fund’s partnership agreement.\n",
      "• On December 30, 2016, we sold a portion of our life settlements portfolio with face value (death benefits) of approximately $4.5 billion.\n",
      "• For certain attractive, high-yielding assets, a series of internal securitizations were completed with the insurance companies over the last two years.\n",
      "In addition, the Legacy Run-Off Insurance business distributed to AIG Parent approximately $1.1 billion in the form of dividends and tax sharing payments resulting from reinsurance transactions. These transactions have helped to reduce the relative size of the Legacy portfolio.\n",

      "• lower Legacy Life earnings in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower returns on alternative investments in hedge funds and lower bond call and tender income.

      "Overview\n",
      "Our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the respective business modules and AIG Parent. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products. The majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of fixed maturity securities.\n",
      "Investment Highlights in 2016\n",
      "• Narrowing of credit spreads more than offset the rise in interest rates, resulting in a net unrealized gain position in our investment portfolio. Net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio increased to approximately $9.7 billion as of December 31, 2016 from approximately $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2015.\n",
      "• We continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities and increased lending activities in mortgage loans with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income.\n",
      "• During 2016, we reduced our hedge fund portfolio by $3.2 billion as a result of redemptions consistent with our planned reduction of exposure. Our alternative investments portfolio performance also experienced a decline in 2016 due to increased volatility in equity markets, primarily in the first quarter of 2016.\n",
      "• Blended investment yields on new investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called.\n",
      "• Other-than-temporary impairments decreased due to lower impairments in our equity securities, available for sale.\n",
      "• We recognized gains on sales of securities in 2016, primarily due to the sale of a portion of our PICC Investment.\n",
      "• The U.S. election and Brexit vote have created increased volatility in credit markets and exchange rates as well as within the equity markets, which may continue for some time.\n",
      "Investment Strategies\n",
      "Investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local and general market conditions, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification.\n",
      "Some of our key investment strategies are as follows:\n",
      "• Fixed maturity securities held by the U.S. insurance companies included in Property Casualty Insurance Companies consist of a mix of instruments that meet our current risk-return, tax, liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectives.\n",
      "• Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by Property Casualty Insurance Companies consist primarily of high-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.\n",
      "• While more of a focus is placed on asset-liability management in Life Insurance Companies, our fundamental strategy across all of our investment portfolios is to optimize the duration characteristics of the assets within a target range based on comparable liability characteristics, to the extent practicable.\n",
      "• AIG Parent, included in Other Operations, actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities. Based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchases publicly traded, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity.\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K 103\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Investments\n",
      "The following table presents the components of Net Investment Income:\n",
      "(a) Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, the presentation of income on alternative investments has been refined to include only income from hedge funds, private equity funds and affordable housing partnerships. Prior period disclosures have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. Hedge funds for which we elected the fair value option are recorded as of the balance sheet date. Other hedge funds are generally reported on a one-month lag, while private equity funds are generally reported on a one-quarter lag.\n",
      "(b) Includes changes in fair value of certain fixed maturity securities where the fair value option has been elected and which are used to economically hedge interest rate and other risks related to our variable annuity guaranteed living benefits. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the net investment income (loss) recorded on these securities was $120 million, $(43) million and $260 million, respectively.\n",
      "Net investment income in 2016 was marginally higher than 2015 as lower income on alternative investments and lower reinvestment yields were approximately offset by an increase in income on life settlements and higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected.\n",
      "Net investment income decreased for 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower income on alternative investments, primarily related to hedge fund performance, lower income on assets for which the fair value option was elected, and lower reinvestment yields.\n",
      "Attribution of Net Investment Income to Product Lines\n",
      "Net investment income is attributed to our businesses based on internal models consistent with the nature of the underlying businesses.\n",
      "For Commercial Insurance - Liability and Financial Lines, Property and Special Risks and Consumer Insurance - Personal Insurance, we estimate investable funds based primarily on loss reserves and unearned premiums. The allocation of net investment income of the Property Casualty Insurance Companies to modules is calculated based on these estimated investable funds, consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities and the capital allocation for each module.\n",
      "For Consumer Insurance - Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, and Life Insurance, Other Operations - Institutional Markets and Legacy Life Insurance Run-Off Lines, net investment income is attributed based on invested assets from segregated product line portfolios held in our Life Insurance Companies. All invested assets of the Life Insurance Companies in excess of liabilities are allocated based on estimates of required economic capital for each product line.\n",
      "Asset Liability Measurement\n",
      "For the Property Casualty Insurance Companies, the duration of liabilities for long-tail casualty lines is greater than that of other lines. As a result, the investment strategy within the Property Casualty Insurance Companies focuses on growth of surplus and preservation of capital, subject to liability and other business considerations.\n",
      "The Property Casualty Insurance Companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies and also invest in structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans. While invested assets backing reserves of the Property Casualty Insurance Companies are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities, we have continued to allocate a portion of our investment activity into asset classes that offer higher yields, particularly in the domestic operations. In addition, we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset-backed investments for their risk-return attributes, as well as to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates. This asset diversification has maintained stable average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity securities were largely unchanged. We expect to continue to pursue this investment strategy to meet the Property Casualty Insurance Companies’ liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives.\n",
      "In addition, the Property Casualty Insurance Companies seek to enhance returns through selective investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio.\n",
      "Fixed maturity investments of the Property Casualty Insurance Companies domestic operations, with an average duration of 4.7 years, are currently comprised primarily of tax-exempt securities, which provide attractive risk-adjusted after-tax returns, as well as\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K 104\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Investments\n",
      "taxable municipal bonds, government and agency bonds, and corporate bonds. The majority of these high quality investments are rated A or higher based on composite ratings.\n",
      "Fixed maturity investments held in the Property Casualty Insurance Companies foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated A or higher based on composite ratings, with an average duration of 3.5 years.\n",
      "The investment strategy of the Life Insurance Companies is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value, subject to liquidity requirements, capital constraints, diversification requirements, asset-liability management and available investment opportunities.\n",
      "The Life Insurance Companies use asset-liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses. The Life Insurance Companies' fundamental investment strategy is to maintain a diversified, high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities that, to the extent practicable, complements the characteristics of liabilities, including duration, which is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities, and as a result, certain portfolios are shorter in duration and others are longer in duration. An extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses, which may require us to further extend the duration of the investment portfolio.\n",
      "The Life Insurance Companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans.\n",
      "In addition, the Life Insurance Companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields. While a diversified portfolio of alternative investments remains a fundamental component of the investment strategy of the Life Insurance Companies, we intend to reduce the overall size of the hedge fund portfolio, in light of changing market conditions and perceived market opportunities, and to continue reducing the size of the private equity portfolio.\n",
      "Fixed maturity investments of the Life Insurance Companies domestic operations, with an average duration of 6.8 years, are comprised primarily of taxable corporate bonds, as well as taxable municipal and government bonds, and agency and non-agency structured securities. The majority of these investments are held in the available for sale portfolio and are rated investment grade based on its composite ratings.\n",
      "Fixed maturity investments held in the Life Insurance Companies foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated A or higher based on composite ratings, with an average duration of 21.2 years.\n",
      "NAIC Designations of Fixed Maturity Securities\n",
      "The Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the National Association of Insurance Companies (NAIC) evaluates the investments of U.S. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called ‘NAIC Designations.’ In general, NAIC Designations of ‘1’ highest quality, or ‘2’ high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while NAIC Designations of ‘3’ through ‘6’ generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade. The NAIC has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities, including non-agency RMBS and CMBS, which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses to better determine the appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities. These methodologies result in an improved NAIC Designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. The following tables summarize the ratings distribution of U.S. Insurance Companies fixed maturity security portfolio by NAIC Designation, and the distribution by composite AIG credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies. See Investments - Credit Ratings herein for a full description of the composite AIG credit ratings.\n",

      "Credit Ratings\n",
      "At December 31, 2016, approximately 92 percent of our fixed maturity securities were held by our domestic entities. Approximately 17 percent of these securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies, and approximately 17 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated. Our investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services’ ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis.\n",
      "Moody’s Investors’ Service Inc. (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&P Global Inc. (S&P), or similar foreign rating services rate a significant portion of our foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio. Rating services are not available for some foreign-issued securities. Our Credit Risk Management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio’s non-rated fixed maturity securities. At December 31, 2016, approximately 19 percent of such investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of our internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated AAA, and approximately 8 percent were below investment grade or not rated. Approximately 36 percent of the foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio is comprised of sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance.\n",

In addition, our updated assumptions for bad-faith claims and unallocated loss adjustment expenses disproportionately impacted these years.\n",
      "• Accident years 2006 to 2010 - adverse development of $846 million were largely impacted by updated loss development selections in U.S. Financial Lines and revised estimates on expected future recoveries from risk-sharing policies in the U.S. Workers’ Compensation business.\n",
      "• Accident years 2005 and prior - adverse development of $1.7 billion was driven by U.S. Excess Casualty revised tail factor selections, updated loss development selections for various U.S. Run-off Casualty Insurance Lines, including updated industry experience for asbestos and revised estimates on expected future recoveries from risk-sharing policies.\n",

The net positive adjustment in 2016 included a net negative adjustment of approximately $24 million in connection with the conversion to a more robust modeling platform for variable annuities, primarily due to refinements to assumptions for guaranteed minimum interest rates and investment fees, partially offset by the impact of other refinements identified during the conversion. In 2015, there were offsetting updates to assumed investment fees, modeled expenses, and terminations, resulting in no net adjustment to pre-tax operating income in Variable and Index Annuities compared to a $4 million net positive adjustment in 2014, which reflected the update of estimated gross profit assumptions.\n",

The update to Life Insurance assumptions also included lower yield and interest credited assumptions.\n",
      "In 2015, the net negative adjustment of $118 million related to the update of actuarial assumptions in Life Insurance was primarily due to lower assumed surrender rates for certain later-duration universal life with secondary guarantees. The net negative adjustment also reflected lower investment spread assumptions, partially offset by more favorable than expected mortality.\n",
      "A net negative adjustment of $32 million in Life Insurance in 2014 was primarily due to additions to reserves for universal life with secondary guarantees, as a result of lower investment spread and mortality assumptions which, while higher than previously assumed, were still within pricing assumptions.\n",

The mortality assumption update did not impact reserves for structured settlements and terminal funding annuities written after April 2012, which are in the Institutional Markets business.\n",
      "Legacy Life Insurance Run-Off Lines recorded loss recognition expense of $28 million and $87 million to increase reserves for certain long-term care business in 2015 and 2014, respectively, which reduced pre-tax operating income in those periods.

      "Differences in Valuation of Embedded Derivatives and Economic Hedge Target\n",
      "The variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents an estimate of the underlying economic risks in our GMWB riders. The economic hedge target differs from the U.S. GAAP valuation of the GMWB embedded derivatives due to the following:\n",
      "• The economic hedge target includes 100 percent of rider fees in present value calculations; the U.S. GAAP valuation reflects only those fees attributed to the embedded derivative such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero;\n",
      "• The economic hedge target uses best estimate actuarial assumptions and excludes explicit risk margins used for U.S. GAAP valuation, such as margins for policyholder behavior, mortality, and volatility; and\n",
      "• The economic hedge target excludes the non-performance or “own credit” risk adjustment (NPA) used in the U.S. GAAP valuation, which reflects a market participant’s view of our claims-paying ability by incorporating an additional spread (the NPA spread) to the swap curve used to discount projected benefit cash flows. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our valuation methodology for embedded derivatives within policyholder contract deposits. Because the discount rate includes the NPA spread and other explicit risk margins, the U.S. GAAP valuation is generally less sensitive to movements in interest rates and other market factors, and to changes from actuarial assumption updates, than the economic hedge target.\n",
      "The market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting. In addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program, the Life Insurance Companies have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees. The primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include:\n",
      "• Basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns, which may be either positive or negative;\n",
      "• Realized volatility versus implied volatility;\n",
      "• Actual versus expected changes in the hedge target driven by assumptions not subject to hedging, particularly policyholder behavior; and\n",
      "• Risk exposures that we have elected not to explicitly or fully hedge.\n",
      "The following table presents a reconciliation between the fair value of the U.S. GAAP embedded derivatives and the value of our economic hedge target:\n",
      "Impact on Pre-tax Income (Loss)\n",
      "The impact on our pre-tax income (loss) of the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits and related hedging results include changes in the fair value of the GMWB embedded derivatives, and changes in the fair value of related derivative hedging instruments, both of which are recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses). Realized capital gains (losses), as well as net investment income from changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities used in the hedging program, are excluded from pre-tax operating income of Individual Retirement and Group Retirement.\n",
      "The change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and the change in the value of the hedging portfolio are not expected to be fully offsetting, primarily due to the differences in valuation between the economic hedge target, the U.S. GAAP embedded derivatives, and changes in the fair value of the hedging portfolio, as discussed above. When corporate credit spreads widen, the change in the NPA spread generally reduces the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a gain, and when corporate credit spreads narrow or tighten, the change in the NPA spread generally increases the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a loss. In addition to changes driven by credit market-related movements in the NPA spread, the NPA balance also reflects changes in business activity and in the net amount at risk from the underlying guaranteed living benefits.\n",

      "The following table presents the net increase (decrease) to consolidated pre-tax income (loss) from changes in the fair value of the GMWB embedded derivatives and related hedges, excluding related DAC amortization:\n",
      "The net impact on pre-tax income from the GMWB and related hedges in 2016 (excluding related DAC amortization) was primarily driven by actuarial assumption updates to surrender and mortality assumptions. The 2015 and 2014 net impacts were primarily driven by changes in the NPA spread. In addition, the impact of rising interest rates and equity markets late in the fourth quarter of 2016 resulted in fair value losses in the hedging portfolio, which were not offset by decreases in the embedded derivative liabilities, because risk margins and other assumptions used for U.S. GAAP valuation cause the embedded derivatives to be less sensitive to changes in market rates than the hedge portfolio. The changes in the economic hedge target and the largely offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedge portfolio were primarily driven by changes in equity markets and interest rates, as discussed below.\n",
      "Change in Economic Hedge Target\n",
      "The increase in the economic hedge target in 2016 was primarily due to the update of actuarial assumptions offset by reductions from positive equity markets and increases in market interest rates, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2016. A decrease in market interest rates, lower equity market performance and the update of actuarial assumptions in 2015 resulted in increases in economic hedge target, which were significantly offset by changes in the value of the hedging portfolio. The increases in the economic hedge target in 2014 were primarily due to declines in interest rates and the update of actuarial assumptions, partially offset by higher equity market returns.\n",
      "Change in Fair Value of the Hedging Portfolio\n",
      "The changes in the fair value of the economic hedge target and, to a lesser extent, the embedded derivatives, were offset in part by the following changes in the fair value of the variable annuity hedging portfolio:\n",
      "• Changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities, for which the fair value option has been elected, are used as a capital-efficient way to economically hedge interest rate and credit spread-related risk. Effective June 30, 2015, we discontinued our U.S. Treasury bond interest rate hedging program and initiated a corporate bond hedging program, which is intended to provide the same capital efficiency as the previous U.S. Treasury bond hedging program. The change in the fair value of the corporate bond hedging program in 2016 included gains, primarily due to credit spreads tightening and decreases in market interest rates in the first nine months of 2016, partially offset by an increase in rates in the fourth quarter of 2016. The change in the fair value of the corporate bond hedging program in 2015 reflected losses, primarily due to increases in market interest rates in the first six months of 2015 and credit spreads widening. The gains in 2014 from the change in the fair value of the fixed maturities securities were due to decreases in market interest rates in 2014. The change in the fair value of the hedging bonds, which is excluded from the pre-tax operating income of the Individual Retirement and Group Retirement segments, is reported in net investment income on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).\n",
      "• Changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative contracts, which included swaps, swaptions and futures, resulted in net losses in 2016 as increases in rates in the fourth quarter of 2016 more than offset the impact of interest rate declines in the first nine months of 2016. The net gains in 2015 on interest rate contracts reflected decreases in market interest rates in the latter half of 2015, partially offset by the impact of increases in rates in the first six months of 2015. In 2014, rates declined throughout the year, resulting in gains from interest rate derivative contracts.\n",
      "• The change in the fair value of equity derivative contracts, which included futures and options, resulted in losses in 2016, 2015 and 2014, which varied based on the relative growth in equity market returns in the respective years.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Insurance Reserves\n",
      "Change in NPA Spread\n",
      "In 2016, tightening of credit spreads resulted in a negative impact on pre-tax income from the change in the NPA spread. In 2015, the impact of widening credit spreads resulted in a significant gain from the change in NPA spread, which was the primary driver of the net positive impact on pre-tax income, compared to a less significant gain from the change in NPA spread in 2014.\n",
      "Update of Actuarial Assumptions\n",
      "The change in embedded derivatives included increases in 2016 due to the update of actuarial assumptions, which primarily reflected lower surrender and mortality assumptions, partially offset by a decrease due to updated assumptions for utilization of withdrawal benefits. The impact of these updated assumptions, which were based on experience studies, was less significant to the embedded derivative liabilities than to the economic hedge target, because the discount rates used to value the embedded derivatives include the additional adjustment for the NPA spread, as well as other explicit risk margins. In addition, the increase in the embedded derivative liabilities from the assumption updates was largely offset by a reduction due to an update of these risk margins. See Update of Actuarial Assumptions for the amount of adjustments included in net capital realized gains (losses) related to the update of actuarial assumptions for GMWB.\n",

      "The net adjustments to DAC amortization from the update of actuarial assumptions for estimated gross profits, including those reported within change in DAC related to net realized capital gains (losses), represented four percent and one percent of the DAC balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n",
      "Reversion to the Mean\n",
      "In 2016, we updated the long-term annual growth assumption applied to subsequent periods used in our reversion to the mean methodology for estimating future estimated gross profits for variable annuity products, from 8.5 percent to 7.5 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected). The five-year reversion to the mean period has not met the criteria for adjustment in 2016, 2015 or 2014; however, sustained favorable equity market performance in excess of long-term assumptions could result in unlocking in the Individual Retirement or Group Retirement variable annuity product lines in the future, with a positive effect on pre-tax income in the period of the unlocking. See Critical Accounting Estimates - Estimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products (Life Insurance Companies) for additional discussion of assumptions related to our reversion to the mean methodology.\n",

      "DAC and Reserves Related to Unrealized Appreciation of Investments\n",
      "DAC for universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the change in DAC as if securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (shadow DAC). Shadow DAC generally moves in the opposite direction of the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, reducing the reported DAC balance when market interest rates decline. Market interest rates as of December 31, 2016 decreased compared to December 31, 2015 as a result of narrowing spreads in 2016. As a result, the unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity securities held in the Life Insurance Companies that support the Core Portfolio businesses at December 31, 2016 increased by $2.1 billion compared to December 31, 2015, which resulted in a decrease in DAC to reflect the shadow DAC adjustment.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Liquidity and Capital Resources\n",
      "Liquidity and Capital Resources\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "Liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet our payment obligations. It is defined as cash and unencumbered assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost. We manage our liquidity prudently through various risk committees, policies and procedures, and a stress testing and liquidity risk framework established by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Our liquidity risk framework is designed to manage liquidity at both AIG Parent and subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six-months under a liquidity stress scenario. See Enterprise Risk Management - Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement and Enterprise Risk Management - Liquidity Risk Management below for additional information.\n",
      "Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. Our primary source of ongoing capital generation is the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. We must comply with numerous constraints on our minimum capital positions. These constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy for both AIG and the individual businesses and are based on internally-defined risk tolerances, regulatory requirements, rating agency and creditor expectations and business needs. Actual capital levels are monitored on a regular basis, and using ERM’s stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital impact of potential macroeconomic, financial and insurance stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraints of both AIG and our insurance subsidiaries.\n",
      "We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events.\n",
      "Nevertheless, some circumstances may cause our cash or capital needs to exceed projected liquidity or readily deployable capital resources as was the case in 2008. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash or capital needs and loss of sources of liquidity and capital. In addition, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.\n",
      "Depending on market conditions, regulatory and rating agency considerations and other factors, we may take various liability and capital management actions. Liability management actions may include, but are not limited to, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers. Capital management actions may include, but are not limited to, paying dividends to our shareholders and share repurchases.\n",

The tax sharing payments may continue to be subject to adjustment in future periods.\n",
      "The dividends and tax sharing payments from our Property Casualty Companies and Life Insurance Companies were funded, in part, by proceeds from the sale of 740 million ordinary H shares of PICC Property & Casualty Company Limited for approximately $1.25 billion in May 2016 and by the sale of AIG Advisor Group in May 2016.\n",

AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. Based upon an assessment of funding needs, the liquidity sources can be readily monetized through sales, repurchase agreements or contributed as admitted assets to regulated insurance companies. AIG Parent liquidity is monitored through the use of various internal liquidity risk measures. AIG Parent’s primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from subsidiaries and credit facilities.

However, our ability to borrow under the Facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the Facility. These include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the Facility would restrict our access to the Facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We expect to borrow under the Facility from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.\n",

Our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of AIG’s major risk positions. Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM. ERM supports our businesses and management in the embedding of risk management in our key day-to-day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing, monitoring and reporting, and mitigating the risks taken by us and our businesses.

Accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit. We review our governance and committee structure on a regular basis and make changes as appropriate to continue to effectively manage and govern our risks and risk-taking.\n",
      "Our Board of Directors oversees the management of risk through its Risk and Capital Committee (RCC) and Audit Committee. Those committees regularly interact with other committees of the Board of Directors. Our Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reports to both the RCC and our Chief Executive Officer (CEO).\n",
      "The Group Risk Committee (GRC): The GRC is the senior management group responsible for assessing all significant risk issues on a global basis to protect our financial strength, optimize our intrinsic value, and protect our reputation. The GRC is chaired by our CRO. Its membership includes our CEO, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and other executives from across our corporate functions and business units. Our CRO reports periodically on behalf of the GRC to both the RCC and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

It primarily focuses on establishing the firm-wide framework for identifying, measuring, quantifying, and managing and mitigating technology and operational risks, and monitoring our controls. The TORCC addresses firm-wide, rather than business-specific issues and is mandated to prioritize technology and operational improvements that are significant and transformational.

      "Business Unit Risk Committees: Each of our major insurance businesses has established a risk committee that serves as the senior management committee responsible for risk oversight at the individual business unit level. The risk committees are responsible for the identification, assessment and monitoring of all sources of risk within their respective portfolios. Specific responsibilities include setting risk tolerances, reviewing the capital allocation framework, insurance portfolio optimization, and providing oversight of risk-adjusted metrics. In addition, each business unit has established subordinate committees at the legal entity level and working groups in place that support these committees in executing their duties, such as ensuring policies are adhered to, and transactions are completed with risk appetite in mind. Together, these committees provide comprehensive risk oversight throughout the organization.\n",

      "Our Risk Appetite Framework integrates stakeholder interests, strategic business goals and available financial resources. We balance these by seeking to take measured risks that are expected to generate repeatable, sustainable earnings and create long-term value for our shareholders. The framework includes our risk appetite statement approved by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof and a set of supporting tools, including risk tolerances, risk limits and policies, which we use to manage our risk profile and financial resources.\n",
      "We articulate our aggregate risk-taking by setting risk tolerances and thresholds on capital and liquidity measures. These measures are set at the AIG Parent level as well as the legal entity level and cover consolidated and insurance company capital and liquidity ratios. We must comply with standards for capital adequacy and maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all our obligations as they come due in accordance with our internal capital management and liquidity policies. Our risk tolerances take into consideration regulatory requirements, rating agency expectations, and business needs. The GRC routinely reviews the level of risk taken by the consolidated\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "organization in relation to the established risk tolerances. A consolidated risk report is also presented periodically, as required, to the RCC by our CRO.\n",
      "Risk Limits\n",
      "A key component of our Risk Appetite Framework is having a process in place that establishes and maintains appropriate limits on the material risks identified for our core businesses and facilitates monitoring and meeting of both internal and external stakeholder expectations. Our objectives include:\n",
      "• Establishing risk monitoring, provide early warning indicators, and ensure timely oversight and enforceability of limits;\n",
      "• Defining a consistent and transparent approach to limits governance; and\n",
      "• Aligning our business activities with our risk appetite statement.\n",
      "To support the monitoring and management of AIG’s and its business units’ material risks, ERM has an established limits framework that employs a three-tiered hierarchy:\n",
      "• Board level risk tolerances are AIG’s aggregate capital and liquidity limits. They define the minimum level of capital and liquidity that we should maintain. These board level risk tolerances require our RCC approval.\n",
      "• AIG management level limits are risk type specific limits at the AIG consolidated level. These limits are defined and calibrated to constrain our concentration in specific risk types, and to protect against taking risks that exceed the amount of overall capital AIG has available. These limits are approved by our CRO with consultation from the GRC.\n",
      "• BU level limits are set to address key risks identified by ERM for the business unit/module and/or meet business unit/module specific requirements by regulators and rating agencies. These limits are defined by the business unit risk officers.\n",
      "All limits are reviewed by the FRG, GRC or relevant business unit risk committees on a periodic basis and revisions, if applicable, are approved by those committees.\n",
      "The business units are responsible for measuring and monitoring their risk exposures. ERM is responsible for monitoring compliance with limits and providing regular, timely reporting to our senior management and risk committees. Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner and are documented and escalated in accordance with their level of severity or materiality.\n",
      "Risk Identification and Measurement\n",
      "One tool we use to inform our Risk Appetite Framework is risk identification. We conduct risk identification through a number of processes at the business unit and corporate level focused on capturing our material risks and key areas of focus for follow-up risk management actions. A key initiative is our integrated bottom-up risk identification and assessment process down to the product-line level. These processes are used as a critical input to enhance and develop our analytics for measuring and assessing risks across the organization.\n",
      "We employ various approaches to measure, monitor, and manage risk exposures, including the utilization of a variety of metrics and early warning indicators. We use a proprietary stress testing framework to measure our quantifiable risks. This framework is built on our existing ERM stress testing methodology for both insurance and non-insurance operations.\n",
      "The framework measures risk over multiple time horizons and under different levels of stress. We develop a range of stress scenarios based both on internal experience and regulatory guidance. The stress tests are intended to ensure that sufficient resources are available under both idiosyncratic and systemic market stress conditions.\n",
      "The stress testing framework assesses our aggregate exposure to our most significant financial and insurance risks, including the risk in each of our key insurance company subsidiaries in relation to its capital needs under stress, risks inherent in our non-insurance company subsidiaries, and risks to AIG consolidated capital. We use this information to determine the resources needed at the AIG Parent level to support our subsidiaries and capital resources required to maintain consolidated company target capitalization levels.\n",

      "We devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures. These exposures may arise from, but are not limited to, fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees and letters of credit.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Our credit risks are managed by a team of investment professionals, subject to ERM oversight and various control processes. ERM is assisted by credit functions headed by highly experienced credit professionals. Their primary role is to assure appropriate credit risk management in accordance with our credit policies and procedures relative to our credit risk parameters. Our Chief Credit Officer (CCO) and credit executives are primarily responsible for the development, implementation and maintenance of a risk management framework, which includes the following elements related to our credit risks:\n",
      "• developing and implementing our company-wide credit policies and procedures;\n",
      "• approving delegated credit authorities to our credit executives and qualified investment professionals;\n",
      "• developing methodologies for quantification and assessment of credit risks, including the establishment and maintenance of our internal risk rating process;\n",
      "• managing a system of credit and program limits, as well as the approval process for credit transactions, above limit exposures, and concentrations of risk that may exist or be incurred;\n",
      "• evaluating, monitoring, reviewing and reporting of credit risks and concentrations regularly with senior management; and\n",
      "• approving appropriate credit reserves, credit-related other-than-temporary impairments and corresponding methodologies for all credit portfolios.\n",
      "We monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require mitigants, such as third-party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, including commercial bank-issued letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. We treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, and letters of credit as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data. We also monitor closely the quality of any trust collateral accounts.\n",

      "Market Risk Management\n",
      "Market risk is defined as the risk of adverse impact due to systemic movements in one or more of the following market risk drivers: equity and commodity prices, residential and commercial real estate values, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange, inflation, and their levels of volatility.\n",
      "We are engaged in a variety of insurance, investment and other financial services businesses that generate market risk, directly and indirectly. We are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities, on both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet through on and off-balance sheet exposures. The chief risk officer within each business is responsible for creating a framework to properly identify these risks, then ensuring that they are appropriately measured, monitored and managed in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the Chief Market Risk Officer (CMRO).\n",
      "The scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner consistent with our risk appetite statement.

      "Equity prices. We are exposed to changes in equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments. Changes in equity prices can affect the valuation of publicly-traded equity shares, investments in private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other equity-linked capital market instruments as well as equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance.\n",
      "Residential and commercial real estate values. Our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments. Changes in residential/commercial real estate prices can affect the valuation of residential/commercial mortgages, residential/commercial mortgage-backed securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential/commercial mortgages, trusts that include residential/commercial real estate and/or mortgages, residential mortgage insurance contracts and commercial real estate investments.\n",
      "Interest rates. Interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities. Lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and make certain of our product offerings less attractive to investors. Conversely, higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons. However, when rates rise quickly, there can be a temporary asymmetric GAAP accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income, and the offsetting decrease in the value of related liabilities may not be recognized. Changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, financial liabilities, insurance contracts including but not limited to fixed rate annuities, variable annuities and derivative contracts.\n",
      "Credit spreads. Credit spreads measure an instrument’s risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default-free instrument. Changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including but not limited to corporate bonds, ABS, mortgage-backed securities, AIG-issued debt obligations, credit derivatives and derivative credit valuation adjustments. Much like higher interest rates, wider credit spreads with unchanged default losses mean more investment income in the long-term. In the short term, quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income. A precipitous widening of credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the credit-worthiness of bond obligors, potentially resulting in default losses.\n",
      "Foreign exchange (FX) rates. We are a globally diversified enterprise with income, assets and liabilities denominated in, and capital deployed in, a variety of currencies. Changes in FX rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of balance sheet and income statement items as well as the settlement of cash flows exchanged in specific transactions.\n",
      "Commodity Prices. Changes in commodity prices (the value of commodities) can affect the valuation of publicly-traded commodities, commodity indices and derivatives on commodities and commodity indices. We are exposed to commodity prices primarily through their impact on the prices and credit quality of commodity producers’ debt and equity securities in our investment portfolio.\n",
      "Inflation. Changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including AIG-issued debt obligations, derivatives and other contracts explicitly linked to inflation indices, and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly, via indexing, or implicitly, through medical costs or wage levels.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Market risk is overseen at the corporate level within ERM through the CMRO, who reports directly to the AIG CRO. The CMRO is supported by a dedicated team of professionals within ERM. Market Risk is managed by our finance, treasury and investment management corporate functions, collectively, and in partnership with ERM. The CMRO is primarily responsible for the development and maintenance of a risk management framework that includes the following key components:\n",
      "• written policies that define the rules for our market risk-taking activities and provide clear guidance regarding their execution and management;\n",
      "• a limit framework that aligns with our Board-approved risk appetite statement;\n",
      "• independent measurement, monitoring and reporting for line of business, business unit and enterprise-wide market risks; and\n",
      "• clearly defined authorities for all individuals and committee roles and responsibilities related to market risk management.\n",
      "• These components facilitate the CMRO’s identification, measurement, monitoring, reporting and management of our market risks.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "Risk Measurement\n",
      "Our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures. At the firm-wide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with AIG’s risk appetite statement. This is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework. Our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital and liquidity levels. At the market risk level, the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change on an economic basis.\n",
      "In addition, we continue to use enhanced economic, GAAP accounting and statutory capital-based risk measures at the market risk level, business-unit level and firm-wide levels. This process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures.\n",
      "We use a number of approaches to measure our market risk exposure, including:\n",
      "Sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input. Examples of such sensitivities include a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity securities, a one basis point increase in credit spreads of fixed maturity securities, and a one percent increase in prices of equity securities.\n",
      "Scenario analysis. Scenario analysis uses historical, hypothetical, or forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures. Examples of hypothetical scenarios include a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve or a 20 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in world-wide equity markets. Scenarios may also utilize a stochastic framework to arrive at a probability distribution of losses.\n",
      "Stress testing. Stress testing is a special form of scenario analysis in which the scenarios are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome. Examples of such scenarios include the stock market crash of October 1987 or the widening of yields or spreads of RMBS or CMBS during 2008.\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K 150\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "Market Risk Sensitivities\n",
      "The following table provides estimates of our sensitivity to changes in yield curves, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates:\n",
      "(a) At December 31, 2016, the analysis covered $276.9 billion of $292.5 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded were $8.1 billion of loans and $2.5 billion of investments in life settlements. In addition, $5.0 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations. At December 31, 2015, the analysis covered $279.6 billion of $298.7 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded were $10.7 billion of loans and $3.6 billion of investments in life settlements. In addition, $4.8 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations.\n",
      "(b) The majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag.\n",
      "Foreign currency-denominated net asset position reflects our consolidated non-U.S. dollar assets less our consolidated non-U.S dollar liabilities on a GAAP basis, with certain adjustments. We use a bottom-up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory capital at the regulated insurance entity level. At the AIG Parent level, we monitor our single foreign currency exposures and limit the risk of the aggregate currency portfolio.\n",
      "Our foreign currency-denominated net asset position at December 31, 2016, decreased by $830 million compared to December 31, 2015. The decrease was mostly due to a $1.6 billion decrease in our Hong Kong dollar position, primarily resulting from the sale of our Property Casualty Insurance Companies’ PICC Investment, partially offset by a $600 million increase in our Japanese yen position primarily due to hedging activities, unrealized appreciation, and strengthening of the yen against the U.S. dollar.\n",
      "For illustrative purposes, we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The estimated results presented in the table above should not be taken as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events.\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K 151\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "The sensitivity factors utilized for 2016 and presented above were selected based on historical data from 1996 to 2016, as follows (see the table below):\n",
      "• a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve is consistent with a one standard deviation movement of the benchmark ten-year treasury yield;\n",
      "• a 20 percent drop for equity and alternative investments is broadly consistent with a one standard deviation movement in the S&P 500; and\n",
      "• a 10 percent depreciation of foreign currency exchange rates is consistent with a one standard deviation movement in the U.S. dollar (USD)/Japanese yen (JPY) exchange rate.\n",
      "Risk Monitoring and Limits\n",
      "The risk monitoring responsibilities, owned by the business units, include ensuring compliance with market risk limits and escalation and remediation of limit breaches. Such activities must be reported to the ERM Market Risk team by the relevant business unit. This monitoring approach is aligned with our overall risk limits framework.\n",
      "To control our exposure to market risk, we rely on a three-tiered hierarchy of limits that the CMRO closely monitors and reports to our CRO, senior management and risk committees.\n",
      "See Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement - Risk Limits herein for further information on our three-tiered hierarchy of limits.\n",
      "Liquidity Risk Management\n",
      "Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations. Failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in insolvency, reduced operating flexibility, increased costs, reputational harm and regulatory action.\n",
      "AIG and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity during both the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash will be available to meet the obligations as they come due.\n",
      "AIG Parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are designed to allow it to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six- months under a liquidity stress scenario. We maintain liquidity limits and minimum coverage ratios designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions. If we project that we will breach these tolerances, we will assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions. However, the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements.\n",
      "Risk Identification\n",
      "The following sources of liquidity and funding risks could impact our ability to meet short-term financial obligations as they come due.\n",
      "• Market/Monetization Risk: Assets may not be readily transformed into cash due to unfavorable market conditions. Market liquidity risk may limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs.\n",
      "• Cash Flow Mismatch Risk: Discrete and cumulative cash flow mismatches or gaps over short-term horizons under both expected and adverse business conditions may create future liquidity shortfalls.\n",
      "• Event Funding Risk: Additional funding may be required as the result of a trigger event. Event funding risk comes in many forms and may result from a downgrade in credit ratings, a market event, or some other event that creates a funding obligation or limits existing funding options.\n",
      "• Financing Risk: We may be unable to raise additional cash on a secured or unsecured basis due to unfavorable market conditions, AIG-specific issues, or any other issue that impedes access to additional funding.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Liquidity risk is overseen at the corporate level within ERM. The AIG CRO has responsibility for the oversight of the Liquidity Risk Management Framework and delegates the day-to-day implementation of this framework to the AIG Treasurer. Our corporate treasury function manages liquidity risk, subject to ERM oversight and various control processes.\n",
      "The Liquidity Risk Management Framework is guided by the liquidity risk tolerance as set forth in the Board-approved risk appetite statement. The principal objective of this framework is to establish minimum liquidity requirements that protect our long-term viability and ability to fund our ongoing business, and to meet short-term financial obligations in a timely manner in both normal and stressed conditions.\n",
      "Our Liquidity Risk Management Framework includes a number of liquidity and funding policies and monitoring tools to address AIG-specific, broader industry and market related liquidity events.\n",
      "Risk Measurement\n",
      "Comprehensive cash flow projections under normal conditions are the primary component for identifying and measuring liquidity risk. We produce comprehensive liquidity projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows. In addition, we perform stress testing by identifying liquidity stress scenarios and assessing the effects of these scenarios on our cash flow and liquidity.\n",
      "We use a number of approaches to measure our liquidity risk exposure, including:\n",
      "Minimum Liquidity Limits: Minimum Liquidity Limits specify the amount of assets required to be maintained in specific liquidity portfolios to meet obligations as they arise over a specified time horizon under stressed liquidity conditions.\n",
      "Coverage Ratios: Coverage Ratios measure the adequacy of available liquidity sources, including the ability to monetize assets to meet the forecasted cash flows over a specified time horizon. The portfolio of assets is selected based on our ability to convert those assets into cash under the assumed market conditions and within the specified time horizon.\n",
      "Cash Flow Forecasts: Cash Flow Forecasts measure the liquidity needed for a specific legal entity over a specified time horizon.\n",
      "Stress Testing: Asset liquidity and Coverage Ratios are re-measured under defined liquidity stress scenarios that will impact net cash flows, liquid assets and/or other funding sources.\n",
      "Relevant liquidity reporting is produced and reported regularly to AIG Parent and business unit risk committees. The frequency, content, and nature of reporting will vary for each business unit and legal entity, based on its complexity, risk profile, activities and size.\n",
      "Operational Risk Management\n",
      "Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss, or other adverse consequences, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or from external events. Operational risk includes legal, regulatory and compliance risks, and excludes business and strategy risks.\n",
      "Operational risk is inherent in each of our business units. Operational risks can have many impacts, including but not limited to: unexpected economic losses or gains, reputational harm due to negative publicity, regulatory action from supervisory agencies, operational and business disruptions, and/or damage to customer relationships.\n",
      "ORM oversees the Operational Risk policy and framework, which includes risk identification, assessment, prioritization, measurement, monitoring, and reporting of operational risk. As part of the framework, we deploy a series of operational risk programs to support our business units with the identification, monitoring and reporting of operational risks. The ORM programs include, but are not limited to, several key components as outlined below:\n",
      "• The Risk Event Capture process enables each employee to identify, document, and escalate operational risk impacts, with a view to enhancing, processes and promoting lessons learned.\n",
      "• The Vulnerability Identification (VID) process identifies emerging risks, which we consider to be risks that have not yet fully manifested themselves but could become significant over time.\n",
      "• The Ordinal Risk Ranking effort provides an ordinal ranking of AIG’s most significant operational risks at the Enterprise, Segment or Regional levels, with the goal of prioritizing assessment and remediation activity.\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K 153\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "• The Risk and Control Self-Assessments (RCSAs) allow for the identification and assessment of the key operational risks within our respective business units and a determination as to whether the related controls are effective.\n",
      "• Scenario Analyses are executed to identify the remote, but plausible, potential risks that could result in severe financial losses.\n",
      "ORM, working together with other second lines of defense functions (e.g., Model Validation and the Technology Risk office, as well as Compliance, Sarbanes Oxley, and Global Business Continuity), provides an independent view of Operational Risk for each business, and works with the business to facilitate implementation of the above programs. This includes coverage of operational risks related to core insurance activities, investing, model risk, technology (including cyber security, access, data privacy and data security), third-party providers, as well as compliance and regulatory matters. Based on the results of the risk identification and assessment efforts above, business leaders are accountable for tracking and remediating identified issues in line with our risk monitoring procedures. Governance committees support these efforts and promote transparency and management decision making.\n",
      "An integrated risk and control framework facilitates the identification and mitigation of operational risk issues. To accomplish this, our integrated risk and control framework is designed to:\n",
      "• ensure first line accountability and ownership of risks and controls;\n",
      "• promote role clarity among the business and risk and control functions;\n",
      "• enhance transparency, risk management governance and culture;\n",
      "• foster greater consistency in identifying and ranking material risks;\n",
      "• pro-actively address potential risk issues and assign clear ownership and accountability for addressing identified risk issues; and\n",
      "• accelerate the development of technology solutions that support the objectives above.\n",
      "Insurance Risks\n",
      "Except as described above, we manage our business risk oversight activities through our insurance operations. A primary goal in managing our insurance operations is to achieve an acceptable risk-adjusted return on equity. To achieve this goal, we must be disciplined in risk selection, premium adequacy, and appropriate terms and conditions to cover the risk accepted.\n",
      "We operate our insurance businesses on a global basis, and we are exposed to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. We manage these risks throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of procedures:\n",
      "• pre-launch approval of product design, development and distribution;\n",
      "• underwriting approval processes and authorities;\n",
      "• exposure limits with ongoing monitoring;\n",
      "• management of relationship between assets and liabilities, including hedging;\n",
      "• enhanced pricing models;\n",
      "• modeling and reporting of aggregations and limit concentrations at multiple levels (policy, line of business, product group, country, individual/group, correlation and catastrophic risk events);\n",
      "• compliance with financial reporting and capital and solvency targets;\n",
      "• use of reinsurance, both internal and third-party; and\n",
      "• review and challenge of reserves to ensure comprehensive analysis with established escalation procedures to provide appropriate transparency in reserving decisions and judgments made in the establishment of reserves.\n",
      "We closely manage insurance risk by monitoring and controlling the nature and geographic location of the risks in each line of business underwritten, the terms and conditions of the underwriting and the premiums we charge for taking on the risk. We analyze concentrations of risk using various modeling techniques, including both probability distributions (stochastic) and/or single-point estimates (deterministic) approaches.\n",
      "Risk Identification\n",
      "• Property Casualty Insurance Companies - risks covered include property, casualty, fidelity/surety, accident and health, aviation, and management liability. We manage risks in the general insurance business through aggregations and limitations of concentrations at multiple levels: policy, line of business, geography, industry and legal entity.\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K 154\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "• Life Insurance Companies - risks include mortality and morbidity in the insurance-oriented products and insufficient cash flows to cover contract liabilities and longevity risk in the retirement savings-oriented products. We manage risks through product design, sound medical and non-medical underwriting, and external reinsurance programs.\n",
      "We purchase reinsurance for our insurance operations. Reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. We may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis. Pooling of our reinsurance risks enables us to purchase reinsurance more efficiently at a consolidated level, manage global counterparty risk and relationships and manage global catastrophe risks.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Insurance risks are monitored at the business unit level within ERM and overseen by the business unit chief risk officer, who reports directly to our CRO. The framework includes the following key components:\n",
      "• written policies that define the rules for our insurance risk-taking activities;\n",
      "• a limit framework focused on key insurance risks that aligns with our Board-approved risk appetite statement; and\n",
      "• clearly defined authorities for all individuals and committee roles and responsibilities related to insurance risk management.\n",
      "Risk Measurement, Monitoring and Limits\n",
      "We use a number of approaches to measure our insurance risk exposure, including:\n",
      "Stochastic methods. Stochastic methods are used to measure and monitor risks including natural catastrophe, reserve and premium risk. We develop probabilistic estimates of risk based on our exposures, historical observed volatility or industry-recognized models in the case of catastrophe risk.\n",
      "Scenario analysis. Scenario or deterministic analysis is used to measure and monitor risks such as terrorism or to estimate losses due to man-made catastrophic scenarios.\n",
      "In addition, we monitor concentrations of exposure through insurance limits aggregated along dimensions such as geography, industry, or counterparty.\n",
      "The risk monitoring responsibilities of the business units include ensuring compliance with insurance risk limits and escalation and remediation of limit breaches. Such activities are reported to management by the relevant business unit for informative decision-making on a regular basis. This monitoring approach is aligned with our overall risk limits framework.\n",
      "Risk limits have a consistent framework used across AIG, its business units, and legal entities. This includes escalation thresholds in cases where measurement is particularly challenging.\n",
      "See Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement - Risk Limits herein for further information on our three-tiered hierarchy of limits\n",
      "Property Casualty Insurance Companies Key Insurance Risks\n",
      "We manage insurance risks through risk review and selection processes, exposure limitations, exclusions, deductibles, self-insured retentions, coverage limits, attachment points, and reinsurance. This management is supported by sound underwriting practices, pricing procedures and the use of actuarial analysis to help determine overall adequacy of provisions for insurance. Underwriting practices and pricing procedures incorporate historical experience, changes in underlying exposure, current regulation and judicial decisions as well as proposed or anticipated regulatory changes.\n",
      "For Property Casualty Insurance Companies, insurance risks primarily include the following:\n",
      "• Loss Reserves - The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the Property Casualty Insurance Companies. There is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. We manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. See Item 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates - Insurance Liabilities - Loss Reserves herein for further information.\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K 155\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "• Underwriting - The potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the Property Casualty Insurance Companies’ ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. This may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, worse than expected prepayment of policies, investment results, or unexpected or increased costs or expenses.\n",
      "• Catastrophe Exposure - Our business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect our operating results. Other risks, such as man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n",
      "• Single Risk Loss Exposure - Our business is exposed to loss events that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. Events such as fires or explosions can result in loss activity for our clients. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by our GRC through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance. Furthermore, single risk loss exposure is managed and monitored on both a segregated and aggregated basis.\n",
      "• Reinsurance - Since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers either due to an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event, or that actual reinsurance coverage is different than anticipated. The inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n",
      "Natural Catastrophe Risk\n",
      "We manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate Probable Maximum Loss (PML) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.\n",
      "We use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. We apply a proprietary multi-model approach to account for relative strengths and weaknesses of vendor models, and make adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.\n",
      "We perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model weaknesses, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. Lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts that allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.\n",
      "We recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policy to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. For example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. In addition, we are committed to providing innovative insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change, including expanding natural disaster resilience, promoting adaptation, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Our internal product development, underwriting, modeling, and sustainability practices will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.\n",
      "Our natural catastrophe exposure is primarily driven by the U.S. and Japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries. For example, we have exposures to additional perils such as European windstorms and floods and seismic events across the Pacific Rim. Within the U.S., we have significant hurricane exposure in Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, Northeast U.S. and mid-Atlantic regions. Events impacting the Northeast U.S. and the mid-Atlantic may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in those regions. Within the U.S., we have significant earthquake exposure in California, the Pacific Northwest and New Madrid regions. Earthquakes impacting the Pacific Northwest and New Madrid regions may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in these regions.\n",
      "The estimates below are the Occurrence Exceedance Probability (OEP) losses, which reflect losses that may occur in any single event due to the defined peril. The 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 PMLs are the probable maximum losses from a single natural catastrophe event with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent in a year, respectively.\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K 156\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "The following table presents an overview of OEP modeled losses for top perils and countries:\n",
      "(a) The U.S. hurricane amount includes losses to Property from hurricane hazards of wind and storm surge.\n",
      "(b) U.S. earthquake loss estimates represent exposure to Property, Workers’ Compensation (U.S.) and A&H business lines.\n",
      "(c) Japan Earthquake represents exposure to Property and A&H business lines.\n",
      "The OEP estimates provided above reflect our in-force portfolios at September 30, 2016, for both U.S. and Japan exposures. The catastrophe reinsurance program is as of January 1, 2017.\n",
      "AIG, along with other property casualty insurance and reinsurance companies, uses industry-recognized catastrophe models and applies proprietary modeling processes and assumptions to arrive at loss estimates. The use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially change the projected losses. Since there is no industry standard for assumptions and preparation of insured data for use in these models, our modeled losses may not be comparable to estimates made by other companies.\n",
      "Also, the modeled results are based on the assumption that all reinsurers fulfill their obligations to us under the terms of the reinsurance arrangements and all catastrophe bonds attach and pay as modeled. However, reinsurance recoverable may not be fully collectible. In particular, the use of catastrophe bonds may not provide commensurate levels of protection compared to traditional reinsurance transactions. Therefore, these estimates are inherently uncertain and may not accurately reflect our exposure to these events.\n",
      "Our 2017 catastrophe reinsurance program includes coverage for natural catastrophes and some coverage for terrorism events. It consists of a large North American occurrence cover (without reinstatement) to protect against large North America losses, and Japan covers to protect against losses in Japan. The attachment point for this reinsurance program is at $1.5 billion for the North American cover ($3 billion in 2016) and varies for the Japan covers. The North American cover has reduced the U.S. Hurricane (1-in-100) OEP net of reinsurance from $3.1 billion under the 2016 reinsurance program to $2.0 billion under the 2017 program.\n",
      "Actual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios. The occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors - Reserves and Exposures for additional information.\n",
      "Terrorism Risk\n",
      "We actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. We have set risk limits based on modeled losses from certain terrorism attack scenarios. Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model and various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the Property Casualty Insurance Companies exposures. Examples of modeled scenarios are conventional bombs of different sizes, anthrax attacks and nuclear attacks.\n",
      "Our largest terrorism exposures are in New York City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers’ Compensation lines of business.

In 2017, TRIPRA covers 83 percent of insured losses above a deductible, decreasing by one percent each year to 80 percent in 2020. The current estimate of our deductible is approximately $2.5 billion for 2016.\n",

      "Reinsurance Activities\n",
      "Reinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss exposure related to certain events such as natural and man-made catastrophes. Our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.\n",
      "Reinsurance markets include:\n",
      "• Traditional local and global reinsurance markets including those in the United States, Bermuda, London and Europe, accessed directly and through reinsurance intermediaries;\n",
      "• Capital markets through insurance-linked securities and collateralized reinsurance transactions, such as catastrophe bonds, sidecars and similar vehicles; and\n",
      "• Other insurers that engage in both direct and assumed reinsurance.\n",
      "The form of reinsurance we may choose from time to time will generally depend on whether we are seeking:\n",
      "• proportional reinsurance, whereby we cede a specified percentage of premiums and losses to reinsurers;\n",
      "• non-proportional or excess of loss reinsurance, whereby we cede all or a specified portion of losses in excess of a specified amount on a per risk, per occurrence (including catastrophe reinsurance) or aggregate basis; or\n",
      "• facultative contracts that reinsure individual policies.\n",
      "We continually evaluate the relative attractiveness of different forms of reinsurance contracts and different markets that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives.\n",
      "Reinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. However, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.\n",
      "In certain markets, we are required to participate on a proportional basis in reinsurance pools based on our relative share of direct writings in those markets. Such mandatory reinsurance generally covers higher-risk consumer exposures such as assigned-risk automobile and earthquake, as well as certain commercial exposures such as workers’ compensation.\n",
      "Reinsurance Recoverable\n",
      "AIG’s reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of:\n",
      "• Paid losses recoverable - balances due from reinsurers for losses and loss adjustment expenses paid by our subsidiaries and billed, but not yet collected.\n",
      "• Ceded loss reserves - ultimate ceded reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, including reserves for claims reported but not yet paid and estimates for IBNR.\n",
      "• Ceded reserves for unearned premiums.\n",
      "At December 31, 2016, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $21.9 billion. These assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $1.1 billion, ceded loss reserves of $15.7 billion including reserves for IBNR, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $3.4 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverables of $1.7 billion. The methods used to estimate IBNR and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. These methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments are reflected in income. We believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at December 31, 2016 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. Actual losses may, however, differ, perhaps materially, from the reserves currently ceded.\n",
      "The Reinsurance Credit Department (RCD) conducts periodic detailed assessments of the financial strength and condition of current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic. The RCD monitors the financial condition of reinsurers as well as the total reinsurance recoverable ceded to reinsurers, and sets limits with regard to the amount and type of exposure we are willing to cede to reinsurers. As part of these assessments, the RCD assesses the financial capacity and liquidity of reinsurers; and evaluates the local economic and financial environment in which foreign reinsurers operate. The RCD reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for measures, including collateral to mitigate credit risk. For example, in our treaty reinsurance contracts, we frequently include provisions that allow us to require a reinsurer to post collateral or use other measures to reduce exposure when a referenced event occurs. Furthermore, we limit our unsecured exposure to reinsurers through the use of credit triggers such as insurer financial strength rating downgrades, declines in regulatory capital, or specified declines in risk-based capital (RBC) ratios. We also set maximum limits for reinsurance recoverable exposure, which in some cases is the recoverable amount plus an estimate of the\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "maximum potential exposure from unexpected loss events that could be ceded to a reinsurer. In addition, credit executives within ERM review reinsurer exposures and credit limits and approve reinsurer credit limits above specified levels. Finally, even where we conclude that uncollateralized credit risk is acceptable, we require collateral from active reinsurance counterparties where it is necessary for our subsidiaries to recognize the reinsurance recoverable assets for statutory accounting purposes. At December 31, 2016, we held $8.1 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or evergreen letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers. We believe that no exposure to a single reinsurer represents an inappropriate concentration of risk to us.\n",

We entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO, discussed in Item 7. MD&A - Insurance Reserves - Reinsurance Activities. Based on reserves as of December 31, 2016, this agreement will increase the gross reinsurance assets and collateral held from the Berkshire Hathaway Group of Companies by approximately $12.8 billion and $10.2 billion, respectively.\n",
      "At December 31, 2016, we had no significant general reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. Reinsurer capital levels remained stable in 2016, and the industry’s robust underwriting capacity resulted in continued competition and attractive rates for 2017 renewals. Reduced profitability associated with lower rates could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. The RCD, in conjunction with the credit executives within ERM, reviews these developments, monitors credit triggers that may require the reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.\n",

      "Our Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance and Institutional Markets businesses manage risk through product design, experience monitoring, pricing actions, risk limitations, reinsurance and active monitoring and management of the relationships between assets and liabilities, including hedging.\n",
      "For our Individual and Group Retirement and Life Insurance products offered by the Life Insurance Companies, key insurance risks include the following:\n",
      "• Mortality risk - represents the risk of loss arising from actual mortality rates being higher than expected mortality rates. This risk could arise from pandemics or other events, including longer-term societal changes that cause higher than expected mortality. This risk exists in a number of our product lines, but is most significant for our life insurance products.\n",
      "• Longevity risk - represents the risk of a change in value of a policy or benefit as a result of actual mortality rates being lower than the expected mortality rates. This risk could arise from longer-term societal health changes as well as other factors. This risk exists in a number of our product lines but is most significant for our retirement, institutional and annuity products.\n",
      "• Policyholder behavior risk including surrender/lapse risk - represents the risk that actual policyholder behavior differs from expected behavior in a manner that has an adverse effect on our results of operations. There are many assumptions made when products are sold, including how long the contracts will persist. Actual experience can vary significantly from these assumptions. This risk is impacted by a number of factors including changes in market conditions, especially interest rate and equity market changes, tax law, regulations and policyholder preferences. This risk exists in the majority of our product lines.\n",
      "• Interest rate risk - represents the potential for loss due to a change in interest rates. Interest rate risk is measured with respect to assets, liabilities (both insurance-related and financial) and derivatives. This risk manifests itself when interest rates move significantly in a short period of time. Rapidly rising interest rates create the potential for increased surrenders. Interest rate risk\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K 159\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "can also manifest itself over a longer period of time, such as in a persistent low interest rate environment. Low long-term interest rates put pressure on investment returns, which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce, or eliminate future profits on certain existing fixed rate products.\n",
      "• Equity risk - represents the potential for loss due to changes in equity prices. It affects equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities (and associated guaranteed living and death benefits, as discussed below), universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance. In addition, changes in the volatility of equity prices can affect the valuation of insurance features that are accounted for as embedded derivatives and the related economic hedges.\n",
      "The emergence of significant adverse experience compared to the initial assumptions at policy issuance or updated assumption would require an adjustment to DAC and benefit reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for a particular period. For additional discussion of the impact of actual and expected experience on DAC and benefit reserves, see Critical Accounting Estimates - Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health (Life Insurance Companies) and Critical Accounting Estimates - Guaranteed Benefit Features of Variable Annuity Products (Life Insurance Companies). For additional discussion of business risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Business and Operations.\n",
      "Variable Annuity Risk Management and Hedging Programs\n",
      "Our Individual and Group Retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with GMWB riders that guarantee a certain level of benefits. GMWB guaranteed living benefits are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses). GMWB features subject the Life Insurance Companies to market risk, including exposure to changes in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility.\n",
      "Variable annuity product design is the first step in managing our exposure to these market risks. Risk mitigation features of our variable annuity product design include GMWB rider fees indexed to an equity market volatility index, which can provide additional fee assessments in periods of increased market volatility, required minimum allocations to fixed accounts to reduce overall equity exposure, and the utilization of volatility control funds, which reduce equity exposure in the funds in response to changes in market volatility, even under sudden or extreme market movements.\n",
      "After reflecting our product risk-mitigating features, we hedge our remaining economic exposure to market risk within GMWB features through our variable annuity hedging program, which is designed to offset certain changes in the economic value of these GMWB embedded derivatives, within established thresholds. The hedging program is designed to provide additional protection against large and combined movements in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility under multiple scenarios.\n",
      "Our hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents our estimate of the underlying economic risks in our GMWB riders, based on the present value of the future expected benefit payments for the GMWB, less the present value of future rider fees, over numerous stochastic scenarios. This stochastic projection method uses best estimate assumptions for policyholder behavior (including mortality, lapses, withdrawals and benefit utilization) in conjunction with market scenarios calibrated to observable equity and interest rate option prices. Policyholder behaviors are regularly evaluated to compare current assumptions to actual experience and, if appropriate, changes are made to the policyholder behavior assumptions. The risk of changes in policyholder behavior is not explicitly hedged and such differences between expected and actual policyholder behaviors may result in hedge ineffectiveness.\n",
      "Due to differences between the calculation of the economic hedge target and U.S. GAAP valuation of the embedded derivative, which include differences in the treatment of rider fees and exclusion of certain risk margins and other differences in discount rates, we expect relative movements in the economic hedge target and the U.S. GAAP embedded derivative valuation will vary over time with changes in equity markets, interest rates and credit spreads. See Insurance Reserves - Life and Annuity Reserves and DAC - Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefits and Hedging Results for information on the impact on our consolidated pre-tax income from the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives and the hedging portfolio, as well as additional discussion of differences between the economic hedge target and the valuation of the embedded derivatives.\n",
      "In designing our hedging portfolio for our variable annuity hedging program, we make assumptions and projections about the future performance of the underlying contract holder funds. To project future account value changes, we make assumptions about how each of the underlying funds will perform. We map the contract holder funds to a set of publicly traded indices that we believe best represent the liability to be hedged. Basis risk exists due to the variance between these assumptions and actual fund returns, which may result in variances between changes in the hedging portfolio and changes in the economic hedge target. Net hedge results and the cost of hedging are also impacted by differences between realized volatility and implied volatility.\n",
      "For index annuity and universal life products, we have a hedging program designed to manage the index crediting strategies associated with index annuity and index life products. This hedging program is designed to offset the economic risk with respect to the index returns for the current crediting rate reset period, and utilizes derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity index\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "options and futures contracts. Similarly as with the variable annuities, there are differences between the calculation of the economic hedge target and U.S. GAAP valuation of the index annuity and index life embedded derivatives, which can lead to variances in their relative movements.\n",
      "To manage the capital market exposures embedded within the economic hedge target, we identify and hedge market sensitivities to changes in equity markets, interest rates, volatility and for variable annuities, credit spreads. Each hedge program purchases derivative instruments or securities having sensitivities that offset those in the economic hedge target, within internally defined threshold levels. Since the relative movements of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target vary over time or with market changes, the net exposure can be outside the threshold limits, and adjustments to the hedging portfolio are made periodically to return the net exposure to within threshold limits.\n",
      "Our hedging programs utilize various derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts, interest rate swaps and swaption contracts, as well as other hedging instruments. In addition, for variable annuities, we purchase certain fixed income securities and elect the fair value option as a capital efficient way to manage interest rate and credit spread exposures. To minimize counterparty credit risk, the majority of our derivative instrument hedges are implemented using exchange-traded futures and options, cleared through global exchanges. Over the counter derivatives are highly collateralized.\n",
      "The hedging programs are monitored on a daily basis to ensure that the economic hedge target and derivative portfolio are within the threshold limits, pursuant to the approved hedge strategy. Daily risk monitoring verifies that the net risk exposures, as measured through sensitivities to a large set of market shocks, are within the approved net risk exposure threshold limits. In addition, monthly stress tests are performed to determine the program’s effectiveness relative to the applicable limits, under an array of combined severe market stresses in equity prices, interest rates, volatility and credit spreads. Finally, hedge strategies are reviewed regularly to gauge their effectiveness in managing our market exposures in the context of our overall risk appetite.\n",

      "Derivative Transactions\n",
      "We utilize derivatives principally to enable us to hedge exposure to interest rates, currencies, credit, commodities, equities and other risks. Credit risk associated with derivative counterparties exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to us. The maximum potential exposure will increase or decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions. All derivative transactions must be transacted within counterparty limits that have been approved by ERM.\n",
      "We evaluate counterparty credit quality by internal analysis consistent with the AIG Credit Policy. We utilize various credit enhancements, including letters of credit, guarantees, collateral, credit triggers, credit derivatives, margin agreements and subordination to reduce the credit risk relating to outstanding financial derivative transactions. We require credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties, and transaction size and maturity. Furthermore, we enter into certain agreements that have the benefit of set-off and close-out netting provisions, such as ISDA Master Agreements. These provisions provide that, in the case of an early termination of a transaction, we can set off receivables from a counterparty against payables to the same counterparty arising out of all covered transactions. As a result, where a legally enforceable netting agreement exists, the fair value of the transaction with the counterparty represents the net sum of estimated fair values.\n",

      "Book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re’s Funds Withheld Assets and deferred tax assets (DTA) (Adjusted book value per common share) is used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-common share basis after eliminating items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period including changes in fair value of AIG’s available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and U.S. tax attribute deferred tax assets. This measure also eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. In addition, we adjust for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re’s Funds Withheld Assets since these fair value movements are economically transferred to Fortitude Re. We exclude deferred tax assets representing U.S. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. Amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. As net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the DTA utilized is included in these book value per common share metrics. Adjusted book value per common share is derived by dividing total AIG common shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re’s Funds Withheld Assets, and DTA (Adjusted Common Shareholders’ Equity), by total common shares outstanding. The reconciliation to book value per common share, the most comparable GAAP measure, is presented in the Executive Summary section of this MD&A.\n",

We believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and U.S. tax attribute deferred tax assets. This measure also eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities.

APTI is a GAAP measure for our segments. For the period ended December 31, 2018, we have excluded changes in the fair value of equity securities from adjusted pre-tax income to be consistent with our elected prospective treatment beginning in the first quarter of 2019 due to a change in accounting principle.

      "- Ratios: We, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses (which for General Insurance excludes net loss reserve discount), and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. Our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under GAAP, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios.\n",
      "- Accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted: both the accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. Natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on AIG in excess of $10 million each and man-made catastrophe losses, such as terrorism and civil disorders that exceed the $10 million threshold. We believe that as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of management’s control. We also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results.\n",

      "Insurance Liabilities\n",
      "Loss Reserves\n",
      "The estimate of the loss reserves relies on several key judgments:\n",

      " the relative weights given to these models by product line;\n",
      " the underlying assumptions used in these models; and\n",
      " the determination of the appropriate groupings of similar product lines and, in some cases, the disaggregation of dissimilar losses within a product line.\n",
      "We use numerous assumptions in determining the best estimate of reserves for each line of business. The importance of any specific assumption can vary by both line of business and accident year. Because actual experience can differ from key assumptions used in establishing reserves, there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves. This is particularly true for long-tail classes of business.\n",
      "All of our methods to calculate net reserves include assumptions about estimated reinsurance recoveries and their collectability. Reinsurance collectability is evaluated independently of the reserving process and appropriate allowances for uncollectible reinsurance are established.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Critical Accounting Estimates\n",
      "Overview of Loss Reserving Process and Methods\n",
      "Our loss reserves can generally be categorized into two distinct groups. Short-tail reserves consists principally of U.S. Property and Special Risks, Europe Property and Special Risks, U.S. Personal Insurance, and Europe and Japan Personal Insurance. Long-tail reserves include U.S. Workers’ Compensation, U.S. Excess Casualty, U.S. Other Casualty, U.S. Financial Lines, Europe Casualty and Financial Lines, and U.S. Run-Off Long Tail Insurance Lines.\n",
      "Short-Tail Reserves\n",
      "For our short-tail coverages, such as property, where the nature of claims is generally high frequency with short reporting periods, with volatility arising from occasional severe events, the process for recording non-catastrophe quarterly loss reserves is geared toward maintaining IBNR based on percentages of net earned premiums for that business, rather than projecting ultimate loss ratios based on reported losses. For example, the IBNR reserve required for the latest accident quarter for a product line such as homeowners might be approximately 20 percent of the quarter’s earned premiums. This level of reserve would generally be recorded regardless of the actual losses reported in the current quarter, thus recognizing severe events as they occur. The percent of premium factor reflects both our expectation of the ultimate loss costs associated with the line of business and the expectation of the percentage of ultimate loss costs that have not yet been reported. The expected ultimate loss costs generally reflect the average loss costs from a period of preceding accident quarters that have been adjusted for changes in rate and loss cost levels, mix of business, known exposure to unreported losses, or other factors affecting the particular line of business. The expected percentage of ultimate loss costs that have not yet been reported would be derived from historical loss emergence patterns. For more mature quarters, specific loss development methods would be used to determine the IBNR. For other product lines where the nature of claims is high frequency but low severity, methods including loss development, frequency/severity or a multiple of average monthly losses may be used to determine IBNR reserves. IBNR for claims arising from catastrophic events or events of unusual severity would be determined in close collaboration with the claims department’s knowledge of known information, using alternative techniques or expected percentages of ultimate loss cost emergence based on historical loss emergence of similar claim types.\n",
      "Long-Tail Reserves\n",
      "Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss adjustment expenses (net losses) for our long-tail Casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the product line and volume of business, as well as estimates of reinsurance recoveries. Experience in the more recent accident years generally provides limited statistical credibility of reported net losses on long-tail Casualty lines of business. That is because in the more recent accident years, a relatively low proportion of estimated ultimate net incurred losses are reported or paid. Therefore, IBNR reserves constitute a relatively high proportion of net losses.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Critical Accounting Estimates\n",
      "We record quarterly changes in loss reserves for each product line of business. The overall change in our loss reserves is based on the sum of the changes for all product lines of business. For most long-tail product lines of business, the quarterly loss reserve changes are based on the estimated current loss ratio for each subset of coverage less any amounts paid. Also, any change in estimated ultimate losses from prior accident years deemed to be necessary based on the results of our latest detailed valuation reviews, large loss analyses, or other analytical techniques, either positive or negative, is reflected in the loss reserve and incurred losses for the current quarter. Differences between actual loss emergence in a given period and our expectations based on prior loss reserve estimates are used to monitor reserve adequacy between detailed valuation reviews and may also influence our judgment with respect to adjusting reserve estimates.\n",
      "Details of the Loss Reserving Process\n",
      "The process of determining the current loss ratio for each product line of business is based on a variety of factors. These include considerations such as: prior accident year and policy year loss ratios; rate changes; and changes in coverage, reinsurance, or mix of business. Other considerations include actual and anticipated changes in external factors such as trends in loss costs, inflation, employment rates or unemployment duration or in the legal and claims environment. The current loss ratio for each product line of business is intended to represent our best estimate after reflecting all of the relevant factors. At the close of each quarter, the assumptions and data underlying the loss ratios are reviewed to determine whether the loss ratios remain appropriate. This process includes a review of the actual loss experience in the quarter, actual rate changes achieved, actual changes in reinsurance, quantifiable changes in coverage or mix of business, and changes in other factors that may affect the loss ratio. When this review suggests that the previously determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate, the loss ratio is changed to reflect the revised estimates.\n",
      "We conduct a comprehensive loss detailed valuation review at least annually for each product line of business in accordance with Actuarial Standards of Practice. These standards provide that the unpaid loss estimate may be presented in a variety of ways, such as a point estimate, a range of estimates, a point estimate based on the expected value of several reasonable estimates, or a probability distribution of the unpaid loss amount. Our actuarial best estimate for each product line of business represents an expected value generally considering a range of reasonably possible outcomes.\n",
      "The reserve analysis for each product line of business is performed by a credentialed actuarial team in collaboration with claims, underwriting, business unit management, risk management and senior management. Our actuaries consider the ongoing applicability of prior data groupings and update numerous assumptions, including the analysis and selection of loss development and loss trend factors. They also determine and select the appropriate actuarial or other methods used to estimate reserve adequacy for each business product line, and may employ multiple methods and assumptions for each product line. These data groupings, accident year weights, method selections and assumptions necessarily change over time as business mix changes, development factors mature and become more credible and loss characteristics evolve. In the course of these detailed valuation reviews an actuarial best estimate of the loss reserve is determined. The sum of these estimates for each product line of business yields an overall actuarial best estimate for that line of business.\n",
      "For certain product lines, we measure sensitivities and determine explicit ranges around the actuarial best estimate using multiple methodologies and varying assumptions. Where we have ranges, we use them to inform our selection of best estimates of loss reserves by major product line of business. Our range of reasonable estimates is not intended to cover all possibilities or extreme values and is based on known data and facts at the time of estimation.\n",
      "We consult with third-party environmental litigation and engineering specialists, third-party toxic tort claims professionals, third-party clinical and public health specialists, third-party workers’ compensation claims adjusters and third-party actuarial advisors to help inform our judgments, as needed.\n",
      "A critical component of our detailed valuation reviews is an internal peer review of our reserving analyses and conclusions, where actuaries independent of the initial review evaluate the reasonableness of assumptions used, methods selected and weightings given to different methods. In addition, each detailed valuation review is subjected to a review and challenge process by specialists in our Enterprise Risk Management group.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Critical Accounting Estimates\n",
      "Actuarial and Other Methods for Major Lines of Business\n",
      "Our actuaries determine the appropriate actuarial methods and segmentation. This determination is based on a variety of factors including the nature of the losses associated with the product line of business, such as the frequency or severity of the claims. In addition to determining the actuarial methods, the actuaries determine the appropriate loss reserve groupings of data. This determination is a judgmental, dynamic process and refinements to the groupings are made every year. The changes to groupings may be driven by and may change to reflect observed or emerging patterns within and across product lines, or to differentiate different risk characteristics (for example, size of deductibles and extent of third-party claims specialists used by our insureds). As an example of reserve segmentation, we write many unique subsets of professional liability, which cover different products, industry segments, and coverage structures. While for pricing or other purposes, it may be appropriate to evaluate the profitability of each subset individually, we believe it is appropriate to combine the subsets into larger groups for reserving purposes to produce a greater degree of credibility in the loss experience. This determination of data segmentation and related actuarial methods is assessed, reviewed and updated at least annually.\n",
      "The actuarial methods we use most commonly include paid and incurred loss development methods, expected loss ratio methods, including “Bornhuetter Ferguson” and “Cape Cod”, and frequency/severity models. Loss development methods utilize the actual loss development patterns from prior accident years updated through the current year to project the reported losses to an ultimate basis for all accident years. We also use this information to update our current accident year loss selections. Loss development methods are generally most appropriate for classes of business that exhibit a stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next, and for which the components of the product line have similar development characteristics. For example, property exposures would generally not be combined into the same product line as casualty exposures, and primary casualty exposures would generally not be combined into the same product line as excess casualty exposures. We continually refine our loss reserving techniques and adopt further segmentations based on our analysis of differing emerging loss patterns for certain product lines. We generally use expected loss ratio methods in cases where the reported loss data lacked sufficient credibility to utilize loss development methods, such as for new product lines of business or for long-tail product lines at early stages of loss development. Frequency/severity models may be used where sufficient frequency counts are available to apply such approaches.\n",
      "Expected loss ratio methods rely on the application of an expected loss ratio to the earned premium for the product line of business to determine the liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses. For example, an expected loss ratio of 70 percent applied to an earned premium base of $10 million for a product line of business would generate an ultimate loss estimate of $7 million. Subtracting any paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve for this product line. Under the Bornhuetter Ferguson methods, the expected loss ratio is applied only to the expected unreported portion of the losses. For example, for a long-tail product line of business for which only 10 percent of the losses are expected to be reported at the end of the accident year, the expected loss ratio would be used to represent the 90 percent of losses still unreported. The actual reported losses at the end of the accident year would be added to determine the total ultimate loss estimate for the accident year. Subtracting the reported paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve. In the example above, the expected loss ratio of 70 percent would be multiplied by 90 percent. The result of 63 percent would be applied to the earned premium of $10 million resulting in an estimated unreported loss of $6.3 million. Actual reported losses would be added to arrive at the total ultimate losses. If the reported losses were $1 million, the ultimate loss estimate under the Bornhuetter Ferguson method would be $7.3 million versus the $7 million amount under the expected loss ratio method described above. Thus, the Bornhuetter Ferguson method gives partial credibility to the actual loss experience to date for the product line of business. Loss development methods generally give full credibility to the reported loss experience to date. In the example above, loss development methods would typically indicate an ultimate loss estimate of $10 million, as the reported losses of $1 million would be estimated to reflect only 10 percent of the ultimate losses.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Critical Accounting Estimates\n",
      "A key advantage of loss development methods is that they respond more quickly to any actual changes in loss costs for the product line of business. Therefore, if loss experience is unexpectedly deteriorating or improving, the loss development method gives full credibility to the changing experience. Expected loss ratio methods would be slower to respond to the change, as they would continue to give more weight to a prior expected loss ratio, until enough evidence emerged to modify the expected loss ratio to reflect the changing loss experience. On the other hand, loss development methods have the disadvantage of overreacting to changes in reported losses if the loss experience is anomalous due to the various key factors described above and the inherent volatility in some of the classes. For example, the presence or absence of large losses at the early stages of loss development could cause the loss development method to overreact to the favorable or unfavorable experience by assuming it is a fundamental shift in the development pattern. In these instances, expected loss ratio methods such as Bornhuetter Ferguson have the advantage of recognizing large losses without extrapolating unusual large loss activity onto the unreported portion of the losses for the accident year.\n",
      "The Cape Cod method is a hybrid between the loss development and Bornhuetter Ferguson methods, where the historic loss data and loss development factor assumptions are used to determine the expected loss ratio estimate in the Bornhuetter Ferguson method.\n",
      "Frequency/severity methods generally rely on the determination of an ultimate number of claims and an average severity for each claim for each accident year. Multiplying the estimated ultimate number of claims for each accident year by the expected average severity of each claim produces the estimated ultimate loss for the accident year. Frequency/severity methods generally require a sufficient volume of claims in order for the average severity to be predictable. Average severity for subsequent accident years is generally determined by applying an estimated annual loss cost trend to the estimated average claim severity from prior accident years. In certain cases, a structural approach may also be used to predict the ultimate loss cost. Frequency/severity methods have the advantage that ultimate claim counts can generally be estimated more quickly and accurately than can ultimate losses. Thus, if the average claim severity can be accurately estimated, these methods can more quickly respond to changes in loss experience than other methods. However, for average severity to be predictable, the product line of business must consist of homogenous types of claims for which loss severity trends from one year to the next are reasonably consistent and where there are limited changes to deductible levels or limits. Generally these methods work best for high frequency, low severity product lines of business such as personal auto. However, frequency and severity metrics are also used to test the reasonability of results for other product lines of business and provide indications of underlying trends in the data. In addition, ultimate claim counts can be used as an alternative exposure measure to earned premiums in the Cape Cod method.\n",
      "Structural driver analytics seek to explain the underlying drivers of frequency/severity. A structural driver analysis of frequency/severity is particularly useful for understanding the key drivers of uncertainty in the ultimate loss cost. For example, for the excess workers’ compensation product line of business, we have attempted to corroborate our judgment by considering the impact on severity of the future potential for deterioration of an injured worker’s medical condition, the impact of price inflation on the various categories of medical expense and cost of living adjustments on indemnity benefits, the impact of injured worker mortality and claim specific settlement and loss mitigation strategies, etc., using the following:\n",
      " Claim by claim reviews, often facilitated by third-party specialists, to determine the stability and likelihood of settling an injured worker’s indemnity and medical benefits;\n",
      " Analysis of the potential for future deterioration in medical condition unlikely to be picked up by a claim file review and associated with potentially costly medical procedures (i.e., increases in both utilization and intensity of medical care) over the course of the injured worker’s lifetime;\n",
      " Analysis of the cost of medical price inflation for each category of medical spend (services and devices) and for cost of living adjustments in line with statutory requirements;\n",
      " Portfolio specific mortality level and mortality improvement assumptions based on a mortality study conducted for our primary and excess workers’ compensation portfolios and our opinion of future longevity trends for the open reported cases;\n",

      "The estimation of liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental pollution losses on insurance policies written many years ago is typically subject to greater uncertainty than other types of losses. This is due to inconsistent court decisions, as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies or have expanded theories of liability. In addition, reinsurance recoverable balances relating to asbestos and environmental loss reserves are subject to greater uncertainty due to the underlying age of the claim, underlying legal issues surrounding the nature of the coverage, and determination of proper policy period. For these reasons, these balances tend to be subject to increased levels of disputes and legal collection activity when actually billed. The insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures.\n",
      "We continue to receive claims asserting injuries and damages from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged claims to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites, referred to collectively as environmental claims, and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. The vast majority of these asbestos and environmental losses emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained absolute exclusions for pollution-related damage and asbestos. The current environmental policies that we specifically price and underwrite for environmental risks on a claims-made basis have been excluded from the analysis.\n",
      "The majority of our exposures for asbestos and environmental losses are related to excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. The litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity amounts, with litigation expenses included within the limits of the liability we incur. Individual significant loss reserves, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case-by-case basis.\n",

      "We generally use a combination of loss development and expected loss ratio methods for U.S. Workers’ Compensation as this line of business is long-tail.\n",
      "The loss cost trend assumption is not believed to be material with respect to our guaranteed cost loss reserves. This is primarily because our actuaries are generally able to use loss development projections for all but the most recent accident year’s reserves, so there is limited need to rely on loss cost trend assumptions for primary workers’ compensation business.\n",
      "The tail factor is typically the most critical assumption, and small changes in the selected tail factor can have a material effect on our carried reserves. For example, the tail factors beyond twenty years for guaranteed cost business could vary by one and one-half percent below to two percent above those actually indicated in the 2020 loss reserve review. For excess of deductible business, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that tail factors beyond twenty years could vary by four percent below to six percent above those actually indicated in the 2020 loss reserve review.\n",

      "Key Assumptions\n",
      "U.S. Excess Casualty\n",
      "We utilize various loss cost trend assumptions for different segments of the portfolio. After evaluating the historical loss cost trends from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss cost trends applicable to the year-end 2020 loss reserve review for U.S. Excess Casualty may range five percent lower or higher than this estimated loss trend. The loss cost trend assumption is critical for the U.S. Excess Casualty class of business due to the long-tail nature of the losses, and is applied across many accident years. Thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years (the expected loss ratio years) to be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends that were initially relied upon in setting the loss reserves. These changes in loss trends could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.\n",
      "U.S. Excess Casualty is a long-tail class of business and any deviation in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. Mass tort claims in particular may develop over a very extended period and impact multiple accident years, so we usually select a separate pattern for them. Thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years to be significantly affected by changes in loss development factors that were initially relied upon in setting the reserves.\n",
      "After evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the actual loss development factors could vary by an amount equivalent to a six month shift from those actually utilized in the year-end 2020 reserve review. This would impact projections both for accident years where the selections were directly based on loss development methods as well as the a priori loss ratio assumptions for accident years with selections based on Bornhuetter-Ferguson or Cape Cod methods. Similar to loss cost trends, these changes in loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.\n",
      "U.S. Other Casualty\n",
      "The key uncertainties for other casualty lines are similar to excess casualty, as the underlying business is long-tailed and can be subject to variability in loss cost trends and changes in loss development factors. These may differ significantly by line of business as coverages such as general liability, medical malpractice and environmental may be subject to different risk drivers.\n",
      "U.S. Financial Lines\n",
      "The loss cost trends for U.S. Directors and Officers (D&O) liability business vary by year and subset, but for the most recent accident years, it is assumed to have been generally close to zero. After evaluating the historical loss cost levels from prior accident years since the early 1990s, including the potential effect of losses relating to the credit crisis, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the actual variation in loss cost levels for these subsets could vary by approximately 10 percent lower or higher on a year-over-year basis than the assumptions actually utilized in the year-end 2020 reserve review. Because U.S. D&O business has exhibited highly volatile loss trends from one accident year to the next, there is the possibility of an exceptionally high deviation. In our analysis, the effects of loss cost trend assumptions affect the results through the a priori loss ratio assumptions used for the Bornhuetter-Ferguson and Cape Cod methods, which impact the projections for the more recent accident years.\n",
      "The selected loss development factors are also an important assumption, but are less critical than for U.S. Excess Casualty. Because these classes are written on a claims made basis, the loss reporting and development tail is much shorter than for U.S. Excess Casualty. However, the high severity nature of the losses does create the potential for significant deviations in loss development patterns from one year to the next. Similar to U.S. Excess Casualty, after evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss development factors could change by an amount equivalent to a shift by six months from those actually utilized in the year-end 2020 reserve review.\n",

      "U.S. Run-Off Long Tail Insurance lines\n",
      "We historically have used a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for excess workers’ compensation and other run-off insurance lines. For environmental claims, we have utilized a variety of methods including traditional loss development approaches, claim department and other expert evaluations of the ultimate costs for certain claims and survival ratio metrics.\n",
      "U.S. Run-Off Long Tail Insurance lines is an extremely long-tail class of business, with a much greater than normal uncertainty as to the appropriate loss development factors for the tail of the loss development. Specifically for excess workers’ compensation, after evaluating the historical loss development factors for prior accident years since the 1980s as well as the development over the past several years of the ground up loss projections utilized to help select the loss development factors in the tail for this class of business, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the tail factor beyond 30 years could vary by 10 percent above or below that actually indicated in the 2020 loss reserve review.\n",
      "Other Reserve Items\n",
      "Loss adjustment expenses (LAE) are separated into two broad categories: allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE), also referred to as legal defense and cost containment or “legal” and unallocated loss adjustment expenses, which includes certain claims adjuster fees and other internal claim management costs.\n",
      "We determine reserves for legal expenses for each class of business by one or more actuarial or structural driver methods. For the majority of lines of business, legal costs are analyzed in conjunction with losses. For lines of business where they are separately analyzed the methods used generally include development methods comparable to those described for loss development methods. The development could be based on either the paid loss adjustment expenses or the ratio of paid loss adjustment expenses to paid losses, or both. Other methods include the utilization of expected ultimate ratios of paid loss expense to paid losses, based on actual experience from prior accident years or from similar product lines of business.\n",
      "The bulk of adjuster expenses are allocated and charged to individual claim files. For these expenses, we generally determine reserves based on calendar year ratios of adjuster expenses paid to losses paid for the particular product line of business. For other internal claim costs, which generally relate to specific claim department expenses that are not allocated to individual claim files such as technology costs and other broad initiatives, we look at historic and expected expenditures for these items and project these into the future.\n",
      "The incidence of LAE is directly related to the frequency, complexity and level of underlying claims. As a result, a key driver of variability in LAE is the variability in the overall claims, particularly for long tail lines.\n",
      "The following sensitivity analysis table summarizes the effect on the loss reserve position of using certain alternative loss cost trend (for accident years where we use expected loss ratio methods) or loss development factor assumptions rather than the assumptions actually used in determining our estimates in the year-end loss reserve analyses in 2020:\n",

      "Long-duration traditional products include whole life insurance, term life insurance, accident and health insurance, long-term care insurance, and certain payout annuities for which the payment period is life-contingent, which include certain of our single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements.\n",
      "For long-duration traditional business, a “lock-in” principle applies. The assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. The assumptions include mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses, and investment returns. These assumptions are typically consistent with pricing inputs. The assumptions also include margins for adverse deviation, principally for key assumptions such as mortality and interest rates used to discount cash flows, to reflect uncertainty given that actual experience might deviate from these assumptions. Establishing margins at contract inception requires management judgment. The extent of the margin for adverse deviation may vary depending on the uncertainty of the cash flows, which is affected by the volatility of the business and the extent of our experience with the product.\n",
      "Loss recognition occurs if observed changes in actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses under loss recognition testing. To determine whether loss recognition exists, we determine whether a future loss is expected based on updated current assumptions. If loss recognition exists, we recognize the loss by first reducing DAC through amortization expense, and, if DAC is depleted, record additional liabilities through a charge to policyholder benefit expense. Because of the long-term nature of many of our liabilities subject to the “lock-in” principle, small changes in certain assumptions may cause large changes in the degree of reserve adequacy. In particular, changes in estimates of future invested asset returns have a large effect on the degree of reserve deficiency.\n",
      "For additional information on loss recognition see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "Groupings for loss recognition testing are consistent with our manner of acquiring, servicing, and measuring the profitability of the business and are applied by product groupings, including traditional life, payout annuities and long-term care insurance. Once loss recognition has been recorded for a block of business, the old assumption set is replaced and the assumption set used for the loss recognition would then be subject to the lock-in principle. For the business ceded to Fortitude Re, 100 percent of the risk is transferred and no additional loss recognition will occur. Key judgments made in loss recognition testing include the following:\n",
      " To determine investment returns used in loss recognition tests, we typically match liabilities with assets of comparable duration, to the extent practicable, and then project future cash flows on those assets. Assets supporting insurance liabilities are primarily comprised of a diversified portfolio of high to medium quality fixed maturity securities, and may also include, to a lesser extent, alternative investments. Our projections include a reasonable allowance for investment expenses and expected credit losses over the projection horizon. A critical assumption in the projection of expected investment income is the assumed net rate of investment return at which excess cash flows are to be reinvested. For products in which asset and liability durations are matched relatively well, this is less of a consideration since interest on excess cash flows are not a significant component of future cash flows. For the reinvestment rate assumption, anticipated future changes to the yield curves could have a large effect. Given the interest rate environment applicable at the date of our most recent loss recognition tests, we assumed a modest and gradual increase in long-term interest rates over time.\n",
      " For mortality assumptions, key judgments include the extent of industry versus own experience to base future assumptions as well as the extent of expected mortality improvements in the future. The latter judgment is based on a combination of historical mortality trends and advice from industry, public health and demography specialists that were consulted by AIG’s actuaries and published industry information.\n",
      " For surrender rates, a key judgment involves the correlation between expected increases/decreases in interest rates and increases/decreases in surrender rates. To support this judgment, we compare crediting rates on our products to expected rates on competing products under different interest rate scenarios.\n",
      " For in-force long-term care insurance, rate increases are allowed but must be approved by state insurance regulators. Consequently, the extent of rate increases that may be assumed requires judgment. In establishing our assumption for rate increases for long-term care insurance, we consider historical experience as to the frequency and level of rate increases approved by state regulators.\n",

In applying shadow loss recognition, the Company overlays unrealized gains and other shadow adjustments onto loss recognition tests without revising the underlying test. Accordingly, there is limited additional judgment in this process.\n",

      "Guaranteed Benefit Features of Variable Annuity Products\n",
      "Variable annuity products offered by our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement product lines offer guaranteed benefit features. These guaranteed features include guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) that are payable in the event of death or other instances, and living benefits that are payable in the event of annuitization, or, in other instances, at specified dates during the accumulation period. Living benefits primarily include guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB).\n",

The liabilities for GMWB, which are recorded in Policyholder contract deposits, are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value of the liabilities recorded in realized capital gains (losses).\n",
      "Our exposure to the guaranteed amounts is equal to the amount by which the contract holder’s account balance is below the amount provided by the guaranteed feature. A variable annuity contract may include more than one type of guaranteed benefit feature; for example, it may have both a GMDB and a GMWB. However, a policyholder can generally only receive payout from one guaranteed feature on a contract containing a death benefit and a living benefit, i.e., the features are generally mutually exclusive (except a surviving spouse who has a rider to potentially collect both a GMDB upon their spouse’s death and a GMWB during his or her lifetime). A policyholder cannot purchase more than one living benefit on one contract. Declines in the equity markets, increased volatility and a sustained low interest rate environment increase our exposure to potential benefits under the guaranteed features, leading to an increase in the liabilities for those benefits.\n",

Estimated gross profits include current and expected interest rates, net investment income and spreads, net realized capital gains and losses, fees, surrender rates, mortality experience and equity market returns and volatility. In estimating future gross profits, lapse assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on DAC amortization.

      "In estimating future gross profits for variable annuity products as of December 31, 2020, a long-term annual asset growth assumption of 7.0 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected) was applied to estimate the future growth in assets and related asset-based fees. In determining the asset growth rate, the effect of short-term fluctuations in the equity markets is partially mitigated through the use of a reversion to the mean methodology, whereby short-term asset growth above or below the long-term annual rate assumption impacts the growth assumption applied to the five-year period subsequent to the current balance sheet date. The reversion to the mean methodology allows us to maintain our long-term growth assumptions, while also giving consideration to the effect of actual investment performance. When actual performance significantly deviates from the annual long-term growth assumption, as evidenced by growth assumptions for the five-year reversion to the mean period falling below a certain rate (floor) or above a certain rate (cap) for a sustained period, judgment may be applied to revise or “unlock” the growth rate assumptions to be used for both the five-year reversion to the mean period as well as the long-term annual growth assumption applied to subsequent periods. The use of a reversion to the mean assumption is common within the industry; however, the parameters used in the methodology are subject to judgment and vary within the industry.\n",

      "Reinsurance Recoverable\n",
      "The estimation of reinsurance recoverable involves a significant amount of judgment, particularly for latent exposures, such as asbestos, due to their long-tail nature. Reinsurance assets include reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses that are estimated as part of our loss reserving process and, consequently, are subject to similar judgments and uncertainties as the estimation of gross loss reserves. Similarly, Other assets include reinsurance recoverable for contracts which are accounted for as deposits.\n",
      "We assess the collectability of reinsurance recoverable balances, at minimum on an annual basis, through either comparison with historical trends of disputes and credit events or financial analysis of the credit quality of the reinsurer. We record adjustments to reflect the results of these assessments through an allowance for credit losses and disputes on uncollectable reinsurance that reduces the carrying amount of reinsurance and other assets on the balance sheet (collectively, the reinsurance recoverable balances). This estimate requires significant judgment for which key considerations include:\n",
      " paid and unpaid amounts recoverable;\n",
      " whether the balance is in dispute or subject to legal collection;\n",
      " the relative financial health of the reinsurer as determined by the Obligor Risk Ratings (ORRs) we assign to each reinsurer based upon our financial reviews; reinsurers that are financially troubled (i.e., in run-off, have voluntarily or involuntarily been placed in receivership, are insolvent, are in the process of liquidation or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction) are assigned ORRs that will generate significant allowance; and\n",
      " whether collateral and collateral arrangements exist.\n",
      "An estimate of the reinsurance recoverable’s lifetime expected credit losses is established utilizing a probability of default and loss given default method, which reflects the reinsurer’s ORR rating. The allowance for credit losses excludes disputed amounts. An allowance for disputes is established for a reinsurance recoverable using the losses incurred model for contingencies.\n",
      "At December 31, 2020, the allowance for credit losses and disputes on reinsurance recoverable was $375 million, or less than one percent of the consolidated reinsurance recoverable.\n",
      "Risk transfer\n",
      "All insurance contracts, including reinsurance contracts, must meet risk transfer requirements in order to use insurance accounting, principally resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract as premiums and losses. If risk transfer requirements are not met, a contract is to be accounted for as a deposit, typically resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract through a deposit asset or liability and not as revenue or expense. To meet risk transfer requirements, all insurance and reinsurance contracts must include insurance risk, consisting of underwriting and timing risk; in addition, reinsurance contracts must also include a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity. We have entered into certain insurance and reinsurance contracts, primarily in our General Insurance companies, that do not contain sufficient insurance risk to be accounted for as insurance or reinsurance and are therefore subject to deposit accounting.\n",

      "If we intend to sell a fixed maturity security, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and the fair value of the security is below amortized cost, an impairment has occurred and the amortized cost is written down to current fair value, with a corresponding charge to realized capital losses. No allowance is established in these situations and any previously recorded allowance is reversed. When assessing our intent to sell a fixed maturity security, or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, management evaluates relevant facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, decisions to reposition our investment portfolio, sales of securities to meet cash flow needs and sales of securities to take advantage of favorable pricing.\n",
      "For fixed maturity securities for which a decline in the fair value below the amortized cost is due to credit related factors, an allowance is established for the difference between the estimated recoverable value and amortized cost with a corresponding charge to realized capital losses. The allowance for credit losses is limited to the difference between amortized cost and fair value. The estimated recoverable value is the present value of cash flows expected to be collected, as determined by management. The difference between fair value and amortized cost that is not associated with credit related factors is presented in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of fixed maturity securities on which an allowance for credit losses was previously recognized (a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income). Accrued interest is excluded from the measurement of the allowance for credit losses.\n",
      "Commercial and residential mortgage loans\n",
      "At the time of origination or purchase, an allowance for credit losses is established for mortgage and other loan receivables and is updated each reporting period. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded in realized capital losses. This allowance reflects the risk of loss, even when that risk is remote, and reflects losses expected over the remaining contractual life of the loan. The allowance for credit losses considers available relevant information about the collectability of cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. We revert to historical information when we determine that we can no longer reliably forecast future economic assumptions.\n",
      "The allowances for the commercial mortgage loans and residential mortgage loans are estimated utilizing a probability of default and loss given default model. Loss rate factors are determined based on historical data and adjusted for current and forecasted information. The loss rates are applied based on individual loan attributes and considering such data points as loan-to-value ratios, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, and debt service coverage.\n",
      "The estimate of credit losses also reflects management’s assumptions on certain macroeconomic factors that include, but are not limited to, gross domestic product growth, employment, inflation, housing price index, interest rates and credit spreads.\n",

In 2020, 2019 and 2018, for substantially all of the reporting units we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment of whether goodwill impairment may exist and, therefore, performed quantitative assessments that supported a conclusion that the fair value of all of the reporting units tested exceeded their book value. To determine fair value, we primarily use a discounted expected future cash flow analysis that estimates and discounts projected future distributable earnings. Such analysis is principally based on our business projections that inherently include judgments regarding business trends.\n",

In order to demonstrate the predictability and sufficiency of future taxable income necessary to support the realizability of the net operating losses and foreign tax credit carryforwards, we have considered forecasts of future income for each of our businesses, including assumptions about future macro-economic and AIG-specific conditions and events, and any impact these conditions and events may have on our prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.

We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, based on technical merits, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recognized in the financial statements.

      "AIG’s Outlook - Industry and economic factors\n",
      "Our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit and equity market conditions, catastrophic claims events, regulation, tax policy, competition, and general economic, market and political conditions. We continued to operate under difficult market conditions in 2020, characterized by factors such as the impact of COVID-19 and the related governmental and societal responses, historically low interest rates, global economic contraction, global trade tensions and Brexit. Brexit has also affected the U.S. dollar/British pound exchange rate and increased the volatility of exchange rates among the Euro, British pound and the Japanese yen (the Major Currencies), which may continue for some time.\n",
      "On October 26, 2020, AIG announced its intention to separate its Life and Retirement business from AIG. No decisions have yet been made regarding the structure of the initial disposition of up to a 19.9% interest in the Life and Retirement business. In addition, any separation transaction will be subject to the satisfaction of various conditions and approvals, including approval by the AIG Board of Directors, receipt of insurance and other required regulatory approvals, and satisfaction of any applicable requirements of the SEC. No assurance can be given regarding the form that a separation transaction may take or the specific terms or timing thereof, or that a separation will in fact occur.\n",
      "For additional information please see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Business and Operations - No assurances can be given that the separation of our Life and Retirement business will occur or as to the specific terms or timing thereof. In addition, the separation could cause the emergence or exacerbate the effects of other risks to which AIG is exposed.\n",
      "Impact of COVID-19\n",
      "We are continually assessing the impact on our business, operations and investments of COVID-19 and the resulting ongoing and severe economic and societal disruption. These impacts, including a global economic contraction, disruptions in financial markets, increased market volatility and declines in certain equity and other asset prices have had and may continue to have negative effects on our investments, our access to liquidity, our ability to generate new sales and the costs associated with claims. In addition, in response to the crisis, new governmental, legislative and regulatory actions have been taken and continue to be developed that have resulted and could continue to result in additional restrictions and requirements, or court decisions rendered, relating to or otherwise affecting our policies that may have a negative impact on our business, operations and capital.\n",
      "General Insurance offers numerous products for which we are monitoring claims activity and assessing adverse impact on future new and renewal business in relation to the COVID-19 crisis. General Insurance had $2.4 billion of pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, in 2020, which included $1.1 billion of estimated COVID-19 losses primarily related to Commercial Property, Validus Re, contingency and travel. The remainder of the catastrophe losses were primarily weather-related. We are continually reassessing our exposures in light of unfolding developments in the U.S. and globally and evaluating coverage by our reinsurance arrangements.\n",
      "In our Life and Retirement business, the most significant impacts relating to COVID-19 have been the impact of interest rate and equity market levels on spread and fee income, deferred acquisition cost amortization and adverse mortality. We are actively monitoring our claims activity and the potential direct and indirect impacts that COVID-19 may have across our portfolio of Life and Retirement businesses.\n",
      "We have a diverse investment portfolio with material exposures to various forms of credit risk. To date, the far reaching economic impacts of COVID-19 have been largely offset, to date, by intervention taken by governments and monetary authorities and equity market rebound resulting in a minimal impact on the value of the portfolio. At this point in time, uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of the COVID-19 crisis makes the long-term financial impact difficult to quantify.\n",
      "For additional information please see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - COVID-19 is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our global business, financial condition and results of operations, and its ultimate impact will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope, severity and duration of the crisis, and the governmental, legislative and regulatory actions taken and court decisions rendered in response thereto.\n",
      "Impact of Changes in the Interest Rate Environment\n",
      "In 2020, interest rates declined in response to COVID-19 and related impacts with key benchmark rates in the U.S. and in many developed markets close to historic lows and, in some international jurisdictions, negative. The low interest rate environment negatively affects sales of interest rate sensitive products in our industry and negatively impacts the profitability of our existing business as we reinvest cash flows from investments, including increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolios. The severe market impacts in 2020 have, however, resulted in an increase in certain credit spreads that partially offset the decrease in benchmark rates. On the other hand, if rates rise, some of these impacts may abate while there may be different impacts, some of which are highlighted below. We actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through portfolio selection and asset-liability management, including spread management\n",

      "strategies for our investment-oriented products and economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable and fixed index annuities.\n",
      "Additionally, sustained low interest rates may result in higher pension expense due to the impact on discounting of projected benefit cash flows.\n",
      "Annuity Sales and Surrenders\n",
      "The sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry. Low long-term interest rates put pressure on investment returns, which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products. However, our disciplined rate setting has helped to mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. Rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased sales, but may also drive higher surrenders. Fixed annuities have surrender charge periods, generally in the three-to-five year range, which may help mitigate increased early surrenders in a rising rate environment. In addition, older contracts that have higher minimum interest rates and continue to be attractive to the contract holders have driven better than expected persistency in fixed annuities, although the reserves for such contracts have continued to decrease over time in amount and as a percentage of the total annuity portfolio. We closely monitor surrenders of fixed annuities as contracts with lower minimum interest rates come out of the surrender charge period. Low interest rates have also reduced growth in our fixed index annuity products, which provide additional interest crediting, tied to favorable performance in certain equity market indices and the availability of guaranteed living benefits. Changes in interest rates significantly impact the valuation of our liabilities for annuities with guaranteed income features and the value of the related hedging portfolio.\n",
      "Reinvestment and Spread Management\n",
      "We actively monitor fixed income markets, including the level of interest rates, credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve. We also frequently review our interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for new and in-force business. Business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in light of the interest rate environment. A low interest rate environment puts margin pressure on pricing of new business and on existing products, due to the challenge of investing new money or recurring premiums and deposits, and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows, in the low interest rate environment. In addition, there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain in-force business. Specifically, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities.\n",
      "The contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in products may reduce spreads in a sustained low interest rate environment and thus reduce future profitability. Although this interest rate risk is partially mitigated through the asset-liability management process, product design elements and crediting rate strategies, a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability.\n",
      "For additional information on our investment and asset-liability management strategies see Investments.\n",
      "For investment-oriented products in our Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance and Institutional Markets businesses, our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business, modifying or limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads, using asset-liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable, and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. Renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals in accordance with state and federal laws and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. We will continue to adjust crediting rates on in-force business to mitigate the pressure on spreads from declining base yields, but our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by the competitive environment, contractual minimum crediting rates, and provisions that allow rates to be reset only at pre-established intervals. As and when interest rates begin to rise again, we may need to raise crediting rates on in-force business for competitive and other reasons potentially reducing the impact of investing in a higher interest rate environment.\n",
      "Of the aggregate fixed account values of our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement annuity products, 67 percent were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at December 31, 2020. The percentage of fixed account values of our annuity products that are currently crediting at rates above one percent was 59 percent and 61 percent at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. These businesses continue to focus on pricing discipline and strategies to manage the minimum guaranteed interest crediting rates offered on new sales in the context of regulatory requirements and competitive positioning. In the core universal life business in our Life Insurance business, 68 percent of the account values were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at December 31, 2020.\n",

      "General Insurance\n",
      "The impact of low interest rates on our General Insurance segment is primarily on our long-tail Casualty line of business. We currently expect limited impacts on our existing long-tail Casualty business as the duration of our assets is slightly longer than that of our liabilities. Sustained low interest rates would potentially impact new and renewal business for the long-tail Casualty line as we may not be able to adjust our future pricing consistent with our profitability objectives to fully offset the impact of investing at lower rates. However, we will continue to maintain pricing discipline and risk selection.\n",
      "In addition, for our General Insurance segment, sustained low interest rates may unfavorably affect the net loss reserve discount for workers’ compensation, and to a lesser extent could favorably impact assumptions about future medical costs, the combined net effect of which could result in higher net loss reserves.\n",

For additional information regarding these legislative and regulatory activities, see Item 1. Business - Regulation - U.S. Regulation - Standard of Care Developments. Changes in standard of care requirements or new standards issued by governmental authorities, such as the DOL, the SEC, the NAIC or state regulators and/or legislators, may affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition.

In accordance with AIG's adjusted after-tax income definition, realized capital gains and losses are excluded from noncontrolling interests. Subsequent to the Majority Interest Fortitude Sale, AIG owns 3.5 percent of Fortitude Holdings and no longer consolidates Fortitude Holdings in its financial statements as of such date.

While the U.S. tax authorities issued formal guidance, including recently issued regulations for BEAT and other provisions of the Tax Act, there are still certain aspects of the Tax Act that remain unclear and subject to substantial uncertainties. Additional guidance is expected in future periods. Such guidance may result in changes to the interpretations and assumptions we made and actions we may take, which may impact amounts recorded with respect to international provisions of the Tax Act, possibly materially.

      "COMPETITION and challenges\n",
      "Operating in a highly competitive industry, General Insurance competes against several hundred companies, specialty insurance organizations, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations in the U.S. In international markets, we compete for business with the foreign insurance operations of large global insurance groups and local companies in specific market areas and product types. Insurance companies compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product pricing, service and terms and conditions. General Insurance seeks to distinguish itself in the insurance industry primarily based on its well-established brand, global franchise, multinational capabilities, financial and capital strength, innovative products, claims expertise to handle complex claims, expertise in providing specialized coverages and customer service.\n",
      "We serve our business and individual customers on a global basis - from the largest multinational corporations to local businesses and individuals. Our clients benefit from our substantial underwriting expertise.\n",
      "Our challenges include:\n",
      " long-tail Commercial Lines exposures that create added challenges to pricing and risk management;\n",
      " over-capacity in certain lines of business that creates downward market pressure on pricing;\n",
      " tort environment volatility in certain jurisdictions and lines of business; and\n",
      " volatility in claims arising from natural and man-made catastrophes, including public health events, such as the COVID-19 crisis.\n",
      "OUTLOOK-INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC FACTORS\n",
      "Below is a discussion of the industry and economic factors impacting our operating segments:\n",
      "The ultimate impact of COVID-19 continues to evolve and will depend upon the scope, severity and duration of the crisis as well as the actions taken by governments, legislative bodies or regulators and other third parties in response, all of which are subject to continuing uncertainty. The results for 2020 include COVID-19 related impacts to both our premium volume and our estimates for catastrophe losses. COVID-19 has driven a material reduction in our revenues in 2020, particularly within the Travel line of business (given the travel restrictions imposed as a result of COVID-19 and the global slowdown) and other lines to a lesser degree. The recessionary impact of COVID-19 has and continues to adversely affect our clients, particularly in certain industry segments where demand and exposures dropped significantly and is likely to remain challenging for a period of time, even after the COVID-19 crisis subsides. The ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business will depend upon the speed at which government mandated safety precautions can be lifted (and the impact of any future shutdowns), the distribution and effectiveness of vaccinations, and the manner and speed with which economic activity rebounds. Although we have seen some benefit in claims experience in lines where economic and social activities have been suppressed (e.g. Personal Auto), this continues to be partly offset by requirements for premium refunds in those lines. The regulatory approach to the crisis and impact on the insurance industry is still developing and its ultimate impact remains uncertain.\n",
      "General Insurance - North America\n",
      "In recent periods Commercial Lines have seen growing market support for rate increases in challenged businesses where major carriers are reducing risk appetite and exhibiting increasing market discipline. As a result, multiple markets are now experiencing rate increases. We are seeing rate increases across U.S. Financial Lines and Liability lines of business (outside of Workers’ Compensation), with a common driver being higher industry-wide claims severity trends, as well as within our Property portfolio. We continue to achieve positive rate increases across a number of lines and classes of business as a result of our disciplined underwriting strategy and focus on risk selection. Despite the higher rates, our retention of business remains in line with recent years and in certain instances has increased. These retention rates are often coupled with an exposure limit management strategy to reduce volatility within the portfolio. We continue to proactively identify businesses to grow in light of evolving market conditions using a portfolio management approach.\n",
      "Personal Insurance growth prospects are supported by the need for full life cycle products and coverage, increases in personal wealth accumulation, and awareness of insurance protection and risk management. We compete in the high net worth market, accident and health insurance, travel insurance, and warranty services and will continue to expand our innovative products and services to distribution partners and clients.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Business Segment Operations | General Insurance\n",
      "General Insurance - International\n",
      "We believe our global presence provides Commercial Lines and Personal Insurance a distinct competitive advantage, as the demand for multinational cross-border coverage and services increases due to the growing number of international customers, while giving us the ability to respond quickly to local market conditions and build client relationships.\n",
      "The Commercial Lines business is showing signs of change, with capacity reducing and the tightening of terms and conditions. We are continuing to grow our most profitable lines of business and diversify our portfolio across all regions by expanding into new product lines (e.g., cyber), new client types (e.g., middle market) and new distribution channels (e.g., digital and national brokers) while remaining a market leader in key developed and developing markets. Overall, Commercial Lines are showing positive rate increases, particularly in our Global Specialty, Financial Lines and Property portfolio and across international markets where market events or withdrawal of capability and capacity have favorably impacted pricing. We are maintaining our underwriting discipline, reducing gross and net limits, increasing use of reinsurance to reduce volatility, as well as continuing our risk selection strategy to improve profitability.\n",
      "Personal Insurance focuses on individual customers, as well as group and corporate clients. Although market competition within Personal Insurance has increased, we continue to benefit from the underwriting quality, portfolio diversity, and generally low volatility of the short-tailed risk in these business lines, although some product classes are exposed to catastrophe losses.\n",

Competition is primarily based on product pricing and design, distribution, financial strength, customer service and ease of doing business.\n",
      "Our business remains competitive due to its long-standing market leading positions, innovative products, distribution relationships across multiple channels, customer-focused service and strong financial ratings.\n",
      "Our primary challenges include:\n",
      " a sustained low interest rate environment, which makes it difficult to profitably price new products and puts margin pressure on existing business due to lower reinvestment yields;\n",
      " increased competition in our primary markets, including aggressive pricing of annuities by private equity-backed annuity writers, increased competition and consolidation of employer groups in the group retirement planning market, and competitors with different profitability targets in the pension risk transfer space as well as other product lines;\n",
      " increasingly complex new and proposed regulatory requirements, which have affected industry growth and costs;\n",
      " upgrading our technology and underwriting processes while managing general operating expenses; and\n",

      "OUTLOOK-INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC FACTORS\n",
      "Below is a discussion of the industry and economic factors impacting our specific operating segments:\n",
      "The impact of COVID-19 is evolving and will ultimately depend upon the scope, severity and duration of the crisis as well as the actions taken by governments, legislative bodies or regulators and other third parties in response, as well as the distribution and effectiveness of vaccinations, all of which continue to be subject to significant uncertainty at this time. The results for 2020 include COVID-19 related impacts on a number of areas including but not limited to DAC/SIA amortization, mortality, reserves and investment returns. During 2020, we experienced significant decreases on our premiums and deposits primarily due to distribution channel disruptions related to COVID-19 and low interest rates. The regulatory approach to the crisis and impact on the insurance industry is continuing to evolve and its ultimate impact remains uncertain.\n",
      "On October 26, 2020, AIG announced its intention to separate its Life and Retirement business from AIG. No decisions have yet been made regarding the structure of the initial disposition of up to a 19.9% interest in the Life and Retirement business. In addition, any separation transaction will be subject to the satisfaction of various conditions and approvals, including approval by the AIG Board of Directors, receipt of insurance and other required regulatory approvals, and satisfaction of any applicable requirements of the SEC. No assurance can be given regarding the form that a separation transaction may take or the specific terms or timing thereof, or that a separation will in fact occur.\n",
      "For additional information please see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Business and Operations - No assurances can be given that the separation of our Life and Retirement business will occur or as to the specific terms or timing thereof. In addition, the separation could cause the emergence or exacerbate the effects of other risks to which AIG is exposed.\n",
      "Individual Retirement\n",
      "Increasing life expectancy and reduced expectations for traditional retirement income from defined benefit programs and fixed income securities are leading Americans to seek additional financial security as they approach retirement. The strong demand for individual index and fixed deferred annuities with guaranteed income features has attracted increased competition in this product space. In response to the continued low interest rate environment, which has added pressure to profit margins, we have developed guaranteed income benefits for variable, fixed index, and fixed deferred annuities with margins that are less sensitive to the level of interest rates.\n",

AIG Retirement Services is a leading retirement plan provider in the U.S. for K-12 schools and school districts, higher education, healthcare, government and other not-for-profit institutions.

      "Consumers have a significant need for life insurance, whether it is used for income replacement for their surviving family, estate planning or wealth transfer. Additionally, consumers use life insurance to provide living benefits in case of chronic, critical or terminal illnesses, and to supplement retirement income.\n",

Digitally enabled processes and tools provide a fast, friendly and simple path to life insurance protection.\n",

      "Institutional Markets serves a variety of needs for corporate clients. Demand is driven by a number of factors including the macroeconomic and regulatory environment.

Partially offsetting these decreases were higher private equity income, higher call and tender income and lower general operating expenses. Adjusted pre-tax income increased in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily driven by decreases in Variable Annuity DAC amortization and reserves due to stronger equity market performances, growth in income from base portfolio due to higher invested assets, higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected, and prior year DAC and reserve model adjustments.

      "Our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit by targeting an asset allocation mix that supports estimated cash flows of our outstanding liabilities and provides diversification from an asset class, sector, issuer, and geographic perspective. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus. The majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of fixed maturity securities.\n",
      "The impact of COVID-19 is evolving rapidly and will depend upon the scope, severity and duration of the crisis as well as the actions taken by governments, legislative bodies or regulators and other third parties in response, all of which are continuing to evolve and are subject to continuing uncertainty. Weak economic conditions resulting from COVID-19 have been met with intervention taken by governments and monetary authorities aimed at stimulating growth, resulting in a sharp recovery on our overall investment portfolio to pre-COVID-19 conditions. In certain segments of our diversified investment portfolio, there have been exposures to certain segments of the economy significantly affected by the crisis, which has, in certain periods, resulted in the recognition of credit losses and increases in our allowance for credit losses. Further recognition of credit losses and increases in our allowances for credit losses could result if businesses remain closed (or are closed again due to resurgences in infections) and the impact of the crisis on the global economy worsens.\n",
      "Investment Strategies\n",
      "Investment strategies are assessed at the segment level and involve considerations that include local and general market conditions, duration and cash flow management, risk appetite and volatility constraints, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, and tax and legal investment limitations.\n",
      "Some of our key investment strategies are as follows:\n",
      " Our fundamental strategy across the portfolios is to seek investments with similar characteristics to the associated insurance liabilities to the extent practicable. AIG embeds Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations in its fundamental investment analysis of the companies or projects we invest in to ensure that they have sustainable earnings over the full term of our investment. AIG considers internal and external factors and evaluates changes in consumer behavior, industry trends related to ESG factors as well as the ability of the management of companies to respond appropriately to these changes in order to maintain their competitive advantage.\n",
      " We seek to originate investments that offer enhanced yield through illiquidity premiums, such as private placements and commercial mortgage loans, which also add portfolio diversification. These assets typically afford credit protections through covenants, ability to customize structures that meet our insurance liability needs, and deeper due diligence given information access.\n",
      " Given our global presence, we have access to assets that provide diversification from local markets. To the extent we purchase these investments, we generally hedge any currency risk using derivatives, which could provide opportunities to earn higher risk adjusted returns compared to assets in the functional currency.\n",
      "116 AIG | 2020 Form 10-K\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Investments\n",
      " AIG Parent, included in Other Operations, actively manages its assets and liabilities, counterparties and duration. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. This strategy allows us to both diversify our sources of liquidity and reduce the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity.\n",
      " Within the U.S., the Life and Retirement and General Insurance investments are generally split between reserve backing and surplus portfolios.\n",
      "- Insurance reserves are backed by mainly investment grade fixed maturity securities that meet our duration, risk-return, tax, liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectives. We assess asset classes based on their fundamental underlying risk factors, including credit (public and private), commercial real estate and residential real estate regardless of whether such investments are bonds, loans, or structured products.\n",
      "- Surplus investments seek to enhance portfolio returns and are generally comprised of a mix of fixed maturity investment grade and below investment grade securities and various alternative asset classes, including private equity, real estate equity, and hedge funds. Over the past few years, hedge fund investments have been reduced with more emphasis given to private equity, real estate and below investment grade credit.\n",
      "Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by insurance companies consist primarily of investment-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.\n",
      "Asset Liability Management\n",
      "The investment strategy within the General Insurance companies focuses on growth of surplus, maintenance of sufficient liquidity for unanticipated insurance claims, and preservation of capital. General Insurance invests primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans. Fixed maturity securities of the General Insurance companies’ North America operations have an average duration of 3.3 years. Fixed maturity securities of the General Insurance companies’ international operations have an average duration of 4.4 years.\n",
      "While invested assets backing reserves of the General Insurance companies are primarily invested in conventional liquid fixed maturity securities, we have continued to allocate to asset classes that offer higher yields through structural and illiquidity premiums, particularly in our North America operations. In addition, we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset-backed investments to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates and inflation. We seek to diversify the portfolio across asset classes, sectors, and issuers to mitigate idiosyncratic portfolio risks.\n",
      "In addition, a portion of the surplus of General Insurance is invested in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments that seek to balance liquidity, volatility and growth of surplus. There is a higher allocation to equity-oriented investments in General Insurance surplus relative to other AIG portfolios given the underlying inflation risks inherent in that business. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio.\n",
      "The investment strategy of the Life and Retirement companies is to provide net investment income to back liabilities that result in stable distributable earnings and enhance portfolio value, subject to asset liability management, capital, liquidity, and regulatory constraints.\n",
      "The Life and Retirement companies use asset-liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses. The Life and Retirement companies maintain a diversified, high-to-medium quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans that, to the extent practicable, match the duration characteristics of the liabilities. We seek to diversify the portfolio across asset classes, sectors, and issuers to mitigate idiosyncratic portfolio risks. The investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities, and as a result, duration varies between distinct portfolios. The interest rate environment has a direct impact on the asset liability management profile of the businesses, and an extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses, which may require us to further extend the duration of the investment portfolio. A further lengthening of the portfolio will be assessed in the context of available market opportunities as longer duration markets may not provide similar diversification benefits as shorter duration markets.\n",
      "Fixed maturity securities of the Life and Retirement companies’ domestic operations have an average duration of 8.8 years.\n",
      "In addition, the Life and Retirement companies seek to enhance surplus portfolio returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved returns in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio returns.\n",

      "The Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the NAIC evaluates the investments of U.S. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called ‘NAIC Designations.’ In general, NAIC Designations of ‘1’ highest quality, or ‘2’ high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while NAIC Designations of ‘3’ through ‘6’ generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade. NAIC designations for non-agency RMBS and CMBS are calculated using third party modeling results provided through the NAIC. These methodologies result in an improved NAIC Designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. The following tables summarize the ratings distribution of AIG subsidiaries’ fixed maturity security portfolio by NAIC Designation, and the distribution by composite AIG credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies.\n",

      "At December 31, 2020, approximately 89 percent of our fixed maturity securities were held by our domestic entities. Approximately 88 percent of these securities were rated investment grade by one or more of the principal rating agencies. Our investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services’ ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis.\n",
      "Moody’s Investors Service Inc. (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&P Global Inc. (S&P), or similar foreign rating services rate a significant portion of our foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio. Rating services are not available for some foreign-issued securities. Our Credit Risk Management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio’s non-rated fixed maturity securities. At December 31, 2020, approximately 95 percent of such investments were either rated investment grade or, on the basis of our internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated investment grade. Approximately 27 percent of the foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio is comprised of sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance.\n",
      "Composite AIG Credit Ratings\n",
      "With respect to our fixed maturity securities, the credit ratings in the table below and in subsequent tables reflect: (i) a composite of the ratings of the three major rating agencies, or when agency ratings are not available, the rating assigned by the NAIC SVO (99 percent of total fixed maturity securities), or (ii) our equivalent internal ratings when these investments have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies or the NAIC.

Under this agreement, we ceded to NICO 80 percent of the losses on subject business paid on or after January 1, 2016 in excess of $25 billion of net paid losses, up to an aggregate limit of $25 billion. We account for this transaction as retroactive reinsurance. This transaction resulted in a gain, which under GAAP retroactive reinsurance accounting is deferred and amortized into income over the settlement period. NICO created a collateral trust account as security for their claim payment obligations to us, into which they deposited the consideration paid under the agreement, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has provided a parental guarantee to secure NICO’s obligations under the agreement.\n",

      "The life insurance companies review and update estimated gross profit assumptions used to amortize DAC and related items (which may include VOBA, SIA and unearned revenue reserves) as well as assessments used to accrue guaranteed benefit reserves for investment-oriented products at least annually. Estimated gross profit projections include assumptions for investment-related returns and spreads, product-related fees and expenses, mortality gains and losses, policyholder behavior and other factors. In estimating future gross profits, lapse assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on DAC amortization. If the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC and related reserves are recalculated using the new projections, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. Updating such projections may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.\n",
      "The life insurance companies also review assumptions related to their respective GMWB living benefits that are accounted for as embedded derivatives and measured at fair value. The fair value of these embedded derivatives is based on actuarial assumptions, including policyholder behavior, as well as capital market assumptions.\n",
      "Various assumptions were updated, including the following effective September 30, 2020:\n",
      "• We decreased our reversion to the mean rates of return (gross of fees) to 3.12 percent from 3.62 percent for the variable annuity product line in Individual Retirement and to 2.87 percent from 3.29 percent for the variable annuity product line in Group Retirement primarily due to recent equity market movements. Our separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption related to equity market performance remained unchanged at 7.0 percent; and\n",
      "• Ultimate projected yields on the vast majority of our invested assets were lowered on life and annuity deposits. Life deposit projected yields ranged from an increase of 9 basis points to a decrease of 14 basis points while annuity insurance deposits saw decreases of up to 24 basis points. Projected yields are graded from a weighted average net GAAP book yield of existing assets supporting the business based on the value of the assets to a weighted average yield based on the duration of the assets excluding assets that mature during the grading period. The grading period is three years for deferred annuity products and five years for life insurance products due to deferred annuities having a shorter duration than life products.\n",

      "For long-duration traditional products discussed below, which include whole life insurance, term life insurance, accident and health insurance, long-term care insurance, and life-contingent single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements, a “lock-in” principle applies. The assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. A loss recognition event occurs when current liabilities together with expected future premiums are not sufficient to provide for all future benefits, expenses, and DAC amortization, net of reinsurance. A loss recognition event is driven by observed changes in actual experience or estimates differing significantly from “locked-in” assumptions. Underlying assumptions, including interest rates, are reviewed periodically and updated as appropriate for loss recognition testing purposes. As a result of the Majority Interest Fortitude Sale, all business that is in loss recognition is fully reinsured by an unaffiliated entity.\n",

      "Our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with GMWB riders that provide guaranteed living benefit features. The liabilities for GMWB are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value. The fair value of the embedded derivatives may fluctuate significantly based on market interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads, market volatility, policyholder behavior and other factors.\n",
      "In addition to risk-mitigating features in our variable annuity product design, we have an economic hedging program designed to manage market risk from GMWB, including exposures to changes in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and volatility. The hedging program utilizes derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts and interest rate swap and swaption contracts, as well as fixed maturity securities with a fair value election.\n",

      "Differences in Valuation of Embedded Derivatives and Economic Hedge Target\n",
      "The variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents an estimate of the underlying economic risks in our GMWB riders. The economic hedge target differs from the GAAP valuation of the GMWB embedded derivatives primarily due to the following:\n",
      " The economic hedge target includes 100 percent of rider fees in present value calculations; the GAAP valuation reflects only those fees attributed to the embedded derivative such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero;\n",
      " The economic hedge target uses best estimate actuarial assumptions and excludes explicit risk margins used for GAAP valuation, such as margins for policyholder behavior, mortality, and volatility; and\n",
      " The economic hedge target excludes the non-performance or “own credit” risk adjustment used in the GAAP valuation, which reflects a market participant’s view of our claims-paying ability by incorporating a different spread (the NPA spread) to the curve used to discount projected benefit cash flows. Because the discount rate includes the NPA spread and other explicit risk margins, the GAAP valuation is generally less sensitive to movements in interest rates and other market factors, and to changes from actuarial assumption updates, than the economic hedge target. For more information on our valuation methodology for embedded derivatives within policyholder contract deposits see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "The market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting. In addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program, the Life and Retirement companies have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees. The primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include:\n",
      " Basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns, which may be either positive or negative;\n",
      " Realized volatility versus implied volatility;\n",
      " Actual versus expected changes in the hedge target driven by assumptions not subject to hedging, particularly policyholder behavior; and\n",

When corporate credit spreads widen, the change in the NPA spread generally reduces the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a gain, and when corporate credit spreads narrow or tighten, the change in the NPA spread generally increases the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a loss. In addition to changes driven by credit market-related movements in the NPA spread, the NPA balance also reflects changes in business activity and in the net amount at risk from the underlying guaranteed living benefits.\n",

      "The net impact on pre-tax income of $210 million from the GMWB embedded derivatives and related hedges in 2020 (excluding related DAC amortization) was driven by the widening of NPA credit spreads, impact of lower interest rates that resulted in NPA volume gains from higher expected GMWB payments, gains from higher equity markets, and gains from the review and update of actuarial assumptions, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates on the change in the fair value of embedded derivatives excluding NPA, net of the hedging portfolio.

      "Reversion to the Mean\n",
      "The reversion to the mean rate is updated quarterly based on market returns and can change dramatically in periods where market returns move significantly. For December 31, 2020 compared to September 30, 2020, we decreased our reversion to the mean rates of return (gross of fees) to 1.66 percent from 3.12 percent for the variable annuity product line in Individual Retirement, and to 0.55 percent from 2.87 percent for the variable annuity product line in Group Retirement, primarily due to recent equity market movements. The five-year reversion to the mean period did not meet the criteria for adjustment in 2020 which would have otherwise required a reset of the start date used in the calculation of the average gross long-term return rate. The long-term growth assumption used in our reversion to the mean methodology remained unchanged at 7.0 percent in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n",

      "DAC and Reserves Related to Unrealized Appreciation of Investments\n",
      "DAC and Reserves for universal life and investment-oriented products are adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the change in DAC, unearned revenue, and benefit reserves with an offset to Other comprehensive income (OCI) as if securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (shadow Investment-Oriented Adjustments). Similarly, for long-duration traditional products, significant unrealized appreciation of investments in a sustained low interest rate environment may cause additional future policy benefit liabilities with an offset to OCI to be recorded.\n",
      "Shadow adjustments to DAC and unearned revenue generally move in the opposite direction of the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, reducing the reported DAC and unearned revenue balance when market interest rates decline. Conversely, shadow adjustments to benefit reserves generally move in the same direction as the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, increasing reported future policy benefit liabilities balance when market interest rates decline.\n",
      "136 AIG | 2020 Form 10-K\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Insurance Reserves\n",
      "Market conditions in 2020 drove an $8.7 billion increase in the unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity securities held to support businesses in the Life and Retirement companies at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, the shadow Investment-Oriented Adjustments reflected decreases in amortized balances including DAC and Unearned Revenue Reserves, while accrued liabilities such as policyholder benefit liabilities increased compared to December 31, 2019. Accrued shadow loss recognition reserves decreased from December 31, 2019, primarily due to the discontinuation of recognizing shadow loss recognition reserves related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets. Although these assets remain on AIG’s balance sheet, subsequent to the June 2, 2020 deconsolidation of Fortitude Re, AIG is no longer exposed to the returns on these assets and corresponding shadow adjustments because the assets economically belong to Fortitude Re as a result of the funds withheld arrangements with Fortitude Holdings.\n",

      "Liquidity and Capital Resources\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "Liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet our payment obligations. It is defined as cash and unencumbered assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost. We endeavor to manage our liquidity prudently through various risk committees, policies and procedures, and a stress testing and liquidity risk framework established by our Treasury group with oversight by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Our liquidity risk framework is designed to manage liquidity at both AIG Parent and its subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six months under a liquidity stress scenario.\n",
      "See Enterprise Risk Management - Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification and Measurement and Enterprise Risk Management - Liquidity Risk Management below for additional information.\n",
      "Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. Our primary source of ongoing capital generation is derived from the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. We must comply with numerous constraints on our minimum capital positions. These constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy at AIG and the individual businesses and are based on internally-defined risk tolerances, regulatory requirements, rating agency and creditor expectations and business needs. Actual capital levels are monitored on a regular basis, and using ERM’s stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital impact of potential macroeconomic, financial and insurance stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraints of both AIG and our insurance subsidiaries.\n",
      "We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events.\n",
      "Nevertheless, some circumstances may cause our cash or capital needs to exceed projected liquidity or readily deployable capital resources. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in credit ratings, catastrophic losses or fluctuations in the capital markets generally may result in significant additional cash or capital needs and loss of sources of liquidity and capital. Other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include an economic collapse of a nation or region significant to our operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval. In addition, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.\n",
      "For a discussion regarding risks associated with COVID-19, see Part I. Item 1A. - Risk Factors - COVID-19 is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our global business, financial condition and results of operations, and its ultimate impact will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope, severity and duration of the crisis, and the governmental, legislative and regulatory actions taken and court decisions rendered in response thereto.\n",
      "Depending on market conditions, regulatory and rating agency considerations and other factors, we may take various liability and capital management actions. Liability management actions may include, but are not limited to, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers. Capital management actions may include, but are not limited to, issuing preferred stock, paying dividends to our shareholders on the AIG Common Stock, paying dividends to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, and repurchases of AIG Common Stock.\n",

AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities and also include a committed, revolving syndicated credit facility. Fixed maturity securities primarily include U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. Based upon an assessment of funding needs, the liquidity sources can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements or contributed as admitted assets to regulated insurance companies. AIG Parent liquidity is monitored through the use of various internal liquidity risk measures. AIG Parent’s primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from subsidiaries and credit facilities. AIG Parent’s primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, and operating expenses.\n",

We expect to access the debt and preferred equity markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed.\n",
      "We utilize our capital resources to support our businesses, with the majority of capital allocated to our insurance operations. Should we have or generate more capital than is needed to support our business strategies (including organic growth or acquisition opportunities) or mitigate risks inherent to our business, we may develop plans to distribute such capital to shareholders via dividends or AIG Common Stock repurchase authorizations or deploy such capital towards liability management.\n",
      "In the normal course, it is expected that a portion of the capital released by our insurance operations, by our other operations or through the utilization of AIG’s deferred tax assets may be available to support our business strategies, for distribution to shareholders or for liability management.\n",
      "In developing plans to distribute capital, AIG considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to: AIG’s business and strategic plans, expectations for capital generation and utilization, AIG’s funding capacity and capital resources in comparison to internal benchmarks, as well as rating agency expectations, regulatory standards and internal stress tests for capital.\n",

Our insurance companies’ liquidity resources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.\n",
      "Each of our material insurance companies’ liquidity is monitored through various internal liquidity risk measures. The primary sources of liquidity are premiums, fees, reinsurance recoverables and investment income and maturities. The primary uses of liquidity are paid losses, reinsurance payments, benefit claims, surrenders, withdrawals, interest payments, dividends, expenses, investment purchases and collateral requirements.\n",
      "Our General Insurance companies may require additional funding to meet capital or liquidity needs under certain circumstances. Large catastrophes may require us to provide additional support to our affected operations. Downgrades in our credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, which could result in non-renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect a subsidiary’s ability to meet its own obligations. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital.\n",
      "Management believes that because of the size and liquidity of our Life and Retirement companies’ investment portfolios, normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience would not create significant liquidity risk. Furthermore, our Life and Retirement companies’ products contain certain features that mitigate surrender risk, including surrender charges. However, in times of extreme capital markets disruption or as a result of fluctuations in the capital markets generally, liquidity needs could outpace resources. As part of their risk management framework, our Life and Retirement companies continue to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue strategies and programs to improve their liquidity position and facilitate their ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio.\n",

Our U.S. General Insurance companies had no outstanding borrowings from FHLBs at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. Our U.S. Life and Retirement companies had $3.6 billion and $3.5 billion which were due to FHLBs in their respective districts at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, under funding agreements issued through our Individual Retirement, Group Retirement and Institutional Markets operating segments, which were reported in Policyholder contract deposits. Proceeds from funding agreements are generally invested in fixed income securities and other investments intended to generate spread income. These investment contracts do not have mortality or morbidity risk and are similar to GICs. In addition, our U.S. Life and Retirement companies had no outstanding borrowings in the form of cash advances from FHLBs at both December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n",
      "Certain of our U.S. Life and Retirement companies have programs, which began in 2012, that lend securities from their investment portfolio to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management. Under these programs, these U.S. Life and Retirement companies lend securities to financial institutions and receive cash as collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. Cash collateral received is invested in short-term investments or partially used for short-term liquidity purposes. Additionally, the aggregate amount of securities that a Life and Retirement company is able to lend under its program at any time is limited to five percent of its general account statutory-basis admitted assets. Our U.S. Life and Retirement companies had $3.4 billion and $2.8 billion of securities subject to these agreements at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $3.5 billion and $2.9 billion of liabilities to borrowers for collateral received at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n",
      "AIG generally manages capital between AIG Parent and our insurance companies through internal, Board-approved policies and limits, as well as management standards. In addition, AIG Parent has unconditional capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) in place with certain subsidiaries. Nevertheless, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer capital freely, either to or from our subsidiaries. In June 2020, upon closing of the Majority Interest Fortitude Sale, the CMA between AIG Parent and Fortitude Re was terminated.\n",

These letters of credit are subject to reimbursement by AIG Parent and/or certain subsidiaries in the event of a drawdown by our insurance companies. Letters of credit issued in support of the General Insurance companies totaled approximately $4.6 billion at December 31, 2020. Letters of credit issued in support of the Life and Retirement companies totaled approximately $612 million at December 31, 2020.

The fixed maturity securities primarily included U.S. treasuries and securities issued by other U.S. agencies. In June 2020, upon closing of the Majority Interest Fortitude Sale, AIG contributed $700 million of the proceeds of the Majority Interest Fortitude Sale to certain of its General Insurance subsidiaries.\n",

      "In October 2020, the Southern District of New York dismissed the case for the 1997 tax year related to the disallowance of foreign tax credits associated with cross border financing transactions based upon the settlement reached between AIG and the government. The settlement concluded our ongoing dispute related to the disallowance of foreign tax credits associated with cross border financing transactions for all years and as a result of the settlement, we will be required to make a payment to the U.S. Treasury. The amount we currently expect to pay based on settlement terms is approximately $0.7 billion, including obligations of AIG Parent and subsidiaries. This amount is net of payments previously made with respect to cross border financing transactions from tax years 1997 through 2006 and other matters related to 2006 and prior, including a prepayment of approximately $548 million that AIG made to the U.S. Treasury in June 2020. The amount also includes interest that will become due after review of the interest calculations and will reflect benefits from the application of interest netting which AIG has requested.

Our ability to utilize the Facility is not contingent on our credit ratings. However, our ability to utilize the Facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the Facility. These include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the Facility would restrict our access to the Facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

These assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force policies. Due to the significance of the assumptions, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. The amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n",
      "We believe that our Life and Retirement companies have adequate financial resources to meet the payments actually required under these obligations. These subsidiaries have substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments. In addition, our Life and Retirement companies maintain significant levels of investment grade rated fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds, and could seek to monetize those holdings in the event operating cash flows are insufficient.

      "Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "Risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns. We consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance.\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "We have an integrated process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm-wide risk appetite. Our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of AIG’s major risk positions. Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve targeted risk tolerances within the framework provided by ERM. ERM supports our businesses and management by embedding risk management in our key day-to-day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, monitoring, reporting, and mitigating the risks taken by our businesses and AIG overall. Nevertheless, our risk management efforts may not always be successful and material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or financial condition may occur.\n",
      "AIG employs a Three Lines of Defense model. AIG’s business leaders assume full accountability for the risks and controls in their operating units, and ERM performs a review, challenge and oversight function. The third line consists of our Internal Audit Group that provides independent assurance for AIG’s Board.\n",
      "Risk Governance Structure\n",
      "Our risk governance structure fosters the development and maintenance of a risk and control culture that encompasses all significant risk categories impacting our lines of business and functions. Accountability for the implementation of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit. We review our governance and committee structure on a regular basis and make changes as appropriate to continue to effectively manage and govern both our risks and risk-taking activities.\n",
      "Our Board of Directors oversees the management of risk through its Risk and Capital Committee (RCC) and Audit Committee. These committees regularly interact with other committees of the Board of Directors which are further described below. Our Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reports to both the RCC and our President and Global Chief Operating Officer.\n",
      "The Group Risk Committee (GRC): The GRC is the senior management group responsible for assessing all significant risk issues on a global basis to protect our financial strength and reputation. The GRC is chaired by our CRO and includes members of the Executive Leadership Team (ELT). Our CRO reports periodically on behalf of the GRC to both the RCC and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Our CRO is also a member of the ELT providing ERM the opportunity to contribute to, review, monitor and consider the impact of changes in strategy.\n",
      "Management committees that support the GRC are described below. These committees are comprised of senior executives and experienced business representatives from a range of functions and business units throughout AIG and its subsidiaries. These committees are charged with identifying, analyzing and reviewing specific risk matters within their respective mandates. In addition, various working groups (e.g. reputational risk, control agenda) are in place in support of the GRC to manage and monitor the various risks across the organization.\n",
      "Financial Risk Group (FRG): The FRG is responsible for the oversight of financial risks taken by AIG and our subsidiaries. Its mandate includes overseeing our aggregate credit, market, interest rate, capital, liquidity and model risks, as well as asset-liability management, derivatives activity, and foreign exchange transactions. It provides the primary corporate-level review function for all proposed transactions and business practices that are significant in size, complex in scope, or that present heightened legal, reputational, accounting or regulatory risks. The FRG is chaired by our CRO. Membership of the FRG also includes our CFO, Chief Investment Officer and Treasurer.\n",
      "Business Unit Risk Committees: Each of our major insurance businesses have established a risk committee that serves as the senior management committee responsible for risk oversight at the individual business unit level. The risk committees are responsible for the identification, assessment and monitoring of all sources of risk within their respective portfolios. Specific responsibilities include setting risk tolerances or limits, reviewing the capital allocation framework, insurance portfolio optimization, decisions with material impact on the risk profile and providing oversight of risk-adjusted metrics. In performing these responsibilities, the business unit risk committees may leverage input provided by other business unit committees and working groups.\n",

      "Our Risk Appetite Framework integrates stakeholder interests, strategic business goals and available financial resources. We balance these by seeking to take measured risks that are expected to generate repeatable, sustainable earnings and create long-term value for our shareholders. The framework includes our risk appetite statement approved by the Board of Directors and a set of supporting tools, including risk tolerances, risk limits and policies, which we use to manage our risk profile and financial resources.\n",
      "We articulate our aggregate risk-taking by setting risk tolerances and thresholds on capital and liquidity measures. These measures are set at the AIG Parent level as well as the legal entity level and cover consolidated and insurance company capital and liquidity ratios. We must comply with standards for capital adequacy and maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all our obligations as they come due in accordance with our capital management and liquidity management policies. Our risk tolerances take into consideration regulatory requirements, rating agency expectations, and business needs. The GRC routinely reviews the level of risk taken by the consolidated organization in relation to the established risk tolerances. A consolidated risk report is also presented periodically to the RCC by our CRO.\n",

      "Risk Limits\n",
      "A key component of our Risk Appetite Framework is having a process in place that establishes and maintains appropriate tolerances and limits on the material risks identified for our core businesses and facilitates the monitoring and meeting of both internal and external stakeholder expectations. Framework objectives include:\n",
      " Establishing risk monitoring, providing early warning indicators, and ensuring timely oversight and enforceability of limits;\n",
      " Defining a consistent and transparent approach to limits governance; and\n",
      " Aligning our business activities with our risk appetite statement.\n",
      "To support the monitoring and management of AIG’s and its business units’ material risks, ERM has an established limits framework that employs a three-tiered hierarchy:\n",
      " Board-level risk tolerances are AIG’s aggregate consolidated capital and parent liquidity limits. They define the minimum level of consolidated capital and parent liquidity that we should maintain. These board-level risk tolerances are approved by the Board and monitored by the RCC.\n",
      " AIG management level limits are risk type specific limits at the AIG consolidated level. These limits are defined and calibrated to constrain our concentration in specific risk types, to protect against taking risks that exceed the amount of overall capital AIG has available, and to protect against excess earnings volatility. These limits are approved by our CRO with consultation from the GRC.\n",
      " Business unit and legal entity level limits are set to address key risks identified for the business unit and legal entities, protect capital and liquidity at legal entities and/or meet legal entity specific requirements of regulators and rating agencies. These limits are defined by the business unit and legal entity risk officers.\n",
      "All limits are reviewed by the GRC or relevant business unit risk committees on a periodic basis and revisions, if applicable, are approved by those committees.\n",
      "The business units are responsible for measuring and monitoring their risk exposures. ERM is responsible for monitoring compliance with limits and providing regular, timely reporting to our senior management and risk committees. Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner and are documented and escalated in accordance with their level of severity or materiality.\n",
      "Risk Identification and Measurement\n",
      "We conduct risk identification through a number of processes at the business unit and corporate level focused on capturing our material risks. A key initiative is our integrated bottom-up risk identification and assessment process which is conducted down to the product-line level. In addition, we perform an annual top-down risk assessment to identify top risks and assign owners to ensure these risks are appropriately addressed and managed. These processes are used as a critical input to enhance and develop our analytics for measuring and assessing risks across the organization.\n",
      "We employ various approaches to measure, monitor and manage risk exposures, including the utilization of a variety of metrics and early warning indicators. We use a proprietary internal capital and stress testing framework to measure our quantifiable risks.\n",
      "The internal capital framework quantifies our aggregate economic risk at a given confidence interval, after taking into account diversification benefits between risk factors and business lines. We leverage the internal capital framework to help inform our consolidated risk consumption and profile as well as risk and capital allocation for our businesses.\n",
      "The stress testing framework assesses our aggregate exposure to our most significant financial and insurance risks, including the risks in each of our key insurance company subsidiaries in relation to its capital needs under stress, risks inherent in our non-insurance company subsidiaries, and risks to AIG consolidated capital. The framework measures risk over multiple time horizons and under different levels of stress, and includes multi-factor stresses as well as single factor sensitivities that are designed to reflect AIG’s risk characteristics. We use this information to support the assessment of resources needed at the AIG Parent level to support our subsidiaries and capital resources required to maintain consolidated company target capitalization levels.\n",

      "We devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures. These exposures may arise from, but are not limited to, fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance and retrocessional insurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees, letters of credit, and certain General Insurance businesses.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Our credit risks are managed by teams of credit professionals, subject to ERM oversight and various control processes. Their primary role is to ensure appropriate credit risk management in accordance with our credit policies and procedures relative to our credit risk parameters. Our Chief Credit Officer (CCO) and credit executives are primarily responsible for the development, implementation and maintenance of a risk management framework, which includes the following elements related to our credit risks:\n",
      " developing and implementing our company-wide credit policies and procedures;\n",
      " approving delegated credit authorities to our credit executives and qualified credit professionals;\n",
      " developing methodologies for quantification and assessment of credit risks, including the establishment and maintenance of our internal risk rating process;\n",

      " evaluating, monitoring, reviewing and reporting of credit risks and concentrations regularly with senior management; and\n",
      " approving appropriate credit reserves, credit-related other-than-temporary impairments and corresponding methodologies for all credit portfolios.\n",
      "We monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require mitigants, such as third-party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, including commercial bank-issued letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. We treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, and letters of credit as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data. We also closely monitor the quality of any trust collateral accounts.\n",

      "Market risk is defined as the risk of adverse impact due to systemic movements in one or more of the following market risk drivers: equity and commodity prices, residential and commercial real estate values, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange, inflation, and their respective levels of volatility.\n",
      "We are engaged in a variety of insurance, investment and other financial services businesses that expose us to market risk, directly and indirectly. We are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities, on both the asset and the liability sides of our balance sheet through on- and off-balance sheet exposures. Within each business, the risk officer is responsible for creating a framework for proper identification of market risks, and ensuring that the risks are appropriately measured, monitored and managed, and are in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the Chief Market Risk Officer (CMRO).\n",
      "The scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner consistent with our risk appetite statement. Our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in the above mentioned market risk drivers.\n",
      "Many of our market risk exposures, including exposures to changes in levels of interest rates and equity prices, are associated with the asset and liability exposures of our Life and Retirement companies. These exposures are generally long-term in nature. Examples of liability-related exposures include interest rate sensitive surrenders in our fixed deferred annuity product portfolio. Also, we have equity market risk sensitive surrenders in our variable annuity product portfolio. These interactive asset-liability types of risk exposures are regularly monitored in accordance with the risk governance framework noted above.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Market risk is overseen at the corporate level within ERM through the CMRO. The CMRO is supported by a dedicated team of professionals within ERM. Market Risk is managed by our finance, treasury and investment management corporate functions, collectively, and in partnership with ERM. The CMRO is primarily responsible for the development and maintenance of a risk management framework that includes the following key components:\n",
      " written policies that define the rules for our market risk-taking activities and provide clear guidance regarding their execution and management;\n",
      " a limit framework that aligns with our Board-approved risk appetite statement;\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "Each of the following systemic risks is considered a market risk:\n",
      "Equity prices\n",
      "We are exposed to changes in equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments. Changes in equity prices can affect the valuation of publicly traded equity shares, investments in private equity, hedge funds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, alternative risk premia investment strategies, and other equity-linked capital market instruments as well as equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities, indexed universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance.\n",
      "Residential and commercial real estate values\n",
      "Our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments. Changes in residential/commercial real estate prices can affect the valuation of residential/commercial mortgages, residential/commercial mortgage-backed securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential/commercial mortgages, trusts that include residential/commercial real estate and/or mortgages, residential mortgage insurance and reinsurance contracts and commercial real estate investments.\n",
      "Interest rates\n",
      "Interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities. Lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and make some of our product offerings less attractive to investors. Conversely, higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons. However, when rates rise quickly, there can be an asymmetric GAAP accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value, which is largely reported through Other comprehensive income, and the offsetting decrease in the value of certain liabilities may not be recognized. Changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, financial liabilities, insurance contracts including but not limited to universal life, fixed rate annuities, variable annuities and derivative contracts. Additionally, for Variable Annuity, Index Annuity, and Equity Indexed Universal Life products, deviations in actual versus expected policyholder behavior can be driven by fluctuations in various market variables, including interest rates. Policies with guaranteed living benefit options or riders are also subject to the risk of actual benefit utilization being different than expected.\n",
      "Credit spreads\n",
      "Credit spreads measure an instrument’s risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default-free instrument. Changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including but not limited to corporate bonds, asset backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, AIG-issued debt obligations, credit derivatives, derivative credit valuation adjustments and economic valuation of insurance liabilities. Much like higher interest rates, wider credit spreads paired with unchanged expectations about default losses imply higher investment income in the long term. In the short term, quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities, which is largely reported through Other comprehensive income. A precipitous widening of credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the credit worthiness of bond obligors, potentially resulting in default losses.\n",
      "Foreign exchange (FX) rates\n",
      "We are a globally diversified enterprise with income, assets and liabilities denominated in, and capital deployed in, a variety of currencies. Changes in FX rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of balance sheet and income statement items as well as the settlement of cash flows exchanged in specific transactions.\n",
      "Commodity prices\n",
      "Changes in commodity prices (the value of commodities) can affect the valuation of publicly-traded commodities, commodity indices, derivatives on commodities and commodity indices, and other commodity-linked investments and insurance contracts. We are exposed to commodity prices primarily through their impact on the prices and credit quality of commodity producers’ debt and equity securities in our investment portfolio.\n",
      "Inflation\n",
      "Changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including AIG-issued debt obligations, derivatives and other contracts explicitly linked to inflation indices, and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly, via indexing, or implicitly, through medical costs or wage levels.\n",

      "Risk Measurement\n",
      "Our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures. At the firm-wide level, market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with AIG’s risk appetite statement. This is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework. The framework measures our overall exposure to change in each of the systemic market risk factors on an economic basis.\n",
      "In addition, we monitor risks through multiple lenses that include economic, GAAP and statutory reporting frameworks at various levels of business consolidation. This process aims to establish a comprehensive coverage of potential implications from adverse market risk developments.\n",
      "We use a number of approaches to measure our market risk exposure, including:\n",
      "Examples include:\n",
      "Sensitivity analysis\n",
      "measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input\n",
      "• a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity securities,\n",
      "• a one basis point increase in credit spreads of fixed maturity securities, and\n",
      "• a one percent increase in prices of equity securities.\n",
      "Scenario analysis\n",
      "uses historical, hypothetical, or forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures\n",
      "• a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, or\n",
      "• a 20 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in world-wide equity markets.\n",
      "Scenarios may also utilize a stochastic framework to arrive at a probability distribution of losses.\n",
      "Stress testing\n",

AIG believes that the interest rate sensitivities of these insurance and other liabilities serve as an offset to the net interest rate risk of the financial assets presented in the table below. In addition, the table excludes $39.9 billion of interest rate sensitive assets and $1.5 billion of equity and alternative investments supporting the Fortitude Re funds withheld arrangements as the contractual returns related to the assets are transferred to Fortitude Re, as well as $43.1 billion of related funds withheld payables.\n",

      "The sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed as predictive of our future financial performance. We cannot ensure that actual financial impacts in any particular period will not exceed the amounts indicated above.\n",
      "Interest rate sensitivity is defined as change in value with respect to a 100 basis point parallel shift up in the interest rate environment, calculated as: scenario value minus base value, where base value is the value under the yield curves as of the period end and scenario value is the value reflecting a 100 basis point parallel increase in all yield curves.\n",
      "We evaluate our interest rate risk without considering effects of correlation of changes in levels of interest rate with other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the values of our financial assets and liabilities. This scenario does not measure changes in values resulting from non-parallel shifts in the yield curves, which could produce different results.\n",
      "We evaluate our equity price risk without considering effects of correlation of changes in equity prices with other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the values of our financial assets and liabilities. The stress scenario does not reflect the impact of basis risk, such as projections about the future performance of the underlying contract holder funds and actual fund returns, which we use as a basis for developing our hedging strategy.\n",
      "Foreign currency-denominated net asset position reflects our aggregated non-U.S. dollar assets less our aggregated non-U.S. dollar liabilities on a GAAP basis, with certain adjustments. We use a bottom-up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory surplus at the regulated insurance entity level. At the AIG consolidated level, we monitor our foreign currency exposures against single currency and aggregate currency portfolio limits.\n",
      "Our foreign currency-denominated net asset position at December 31, 2020 increased by $0.1 billion compared to December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in our Canadian dollar position, due to exposure management actions in the US Pool, coupled with a decrease in our British pound position, primarily as a result of debt hedges unwind, as well as an increase in the Euro position, largely due to hedging activity.\n",
      "For illustrative purposes, we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point parallel increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equity prices and prices of alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar.

      "Liquidity Risk Management\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations as they come due. Failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in insolvency, reduced operating flexibility, increased costs, reputational harm and regulatory action.\n",
      "AIG and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity both during the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash will be available to meet the obligations as they come due.\n",
      "AIG Parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are designed to allow us to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six months under a liquidity stress scenario. We maintain liquidity limits and minimum coverage ratios designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying stress conditions. If we project that we could breach these tolerances, we assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions. However, the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Liquidity risk is overseen at the corporate level within ERM. The CRO has responsibility for the oversight of the Liquidity Risk Management Framework and delegates the day-to-day implementation of this framework to the AIG Treasurer. Our treasury function manages liquidity risk, subject to ERM oversight and various control processes.\n",
      "The Liquidity Risk Management Framework is guided by the liquidity risk tolerance as set forth in the Board-approved risk appetite statement. The principal objective of this framework is to establish minimum liquidity requirements that protect our long-term viability and ability to fund our ongoing business, and to meet short-term financial obligations in a timely manner in both normal and stressed conditions.\n",
      "Our Liquidity Risk Management Framework includes liquidity and funding policies and monitoring tools to address AIG-specific, broader industry and market-related liquidity events.\n",
      "Risk Identification\n",

      "Market/Monetization Risk\n",
      "Assets may not be readily transformed into cash due to unfavorable market conditions. Market liquidity risk may limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values or necessary volumes to meet liquidity needs.\n",
      "Cash Flow Mismatch Risk\n",
      "Discrete and cumulative cash flow mismatches or gaps over short-term horizons under both expected and adverse business conditions may create future liquidity shortfalls.\n",
      "Event Funding Risk\n",
      "Additional funding may be required as the result of a trigger event. Event funding risk comes in many forms and may result from a downgrade in credit ratings, a market event, or some other event that creates a funding obligation or limits existing funding options.\n",
      "Financing Risk\n",
      "We may be unable to raise additional cash on a secured or unsecured basis due to unfavorable market conditions, AIG-specific issues, or any other issue that impedes access to additional funding.\n",
      "Risk Measurement\n",
      "Comprehensive cash flow projections under normal conditions are the primary component for identifying and measuring liquidity risk. We produce comprehensive liquidity projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows. In addition, we perform stress testing by identifying liquidity stress scenarios and assessing the effects of these scenarios on our cash flow and liquidity.\n",

      "Overview\n",
      "Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss, or other adverse consequences, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or from external events. Operational risk includes legal, regulatory, technology, compliance, third-party and business continuity risks, but excludes business and strategy risks.\n",
      "Operational risk is inherent in each of our business units and functions and can have many impacts, including but not limited to: unexpected economic losses or gains, reputational harm due to negative publicity, regulatory action from supervisory agencies and operational and business disruptions, and/or damage to customer relationships.\n",

      "Risk Identification, Measurement and Monitoring\n",
      "The Operational Risk Management (ORM) function within ERM oversees adherence to the operational risk policy and risk and control framework, which includes risk identification, assessment, measurement, management and monitoring of operational risk exposures. ORM supports the Head of Governance and Operational Controls and has responsibility to provide an aggregate view of our operational risk profile. In line with the Three Lines of Defense Model, the ORM program includes, but is not limited to, several key components outlined below:\n",
      " Risk Event Capture - enables every employee to identify, document, and escalate operational risk events, with a view to enhancing processes, promoting lessons learned and embedding a culture of risk management.\n",
      " Risk Assessments - allows for the assessment, measurement and management of the key operational risks within our business units and helps inform on the efficacy of our control environment.\n",
      " Key Risk Indicators - enhances the ongoing monitoring and mitigation of operational risks and facilitate risk reporting.\n",
      " Issues Management - enables a consistent tracking of issues across the firm, including policy and process exceptions, control deficiencies and findings from risk and control assessment activities.\n",
      " Scenario Analyses - executed by first- and second-line professionals to identify potential risks that could result in financial losses to the firm and support the prioritization of operational risk treatment.\n",

The OCA’s responsibilities include coordinating identification, assessment, control and mitigation of risks to the operating environment and promoting awareness to facilitate implementation of the above programs. This includes coverage of operational risks related to core insurance activities, corporate functions, investing, model risk, technology, third-party providers, as well as compliance and regulatory matters. Based on the results of the risk identification and assessment efforts above, business leaders are accountable for tracking and remediating identified issues in line with our risk-monitoring procedures. Governance committees support these efforts and promote transparency enabling improved management decision making.\n",
      "Cybersecurity Risk\n",
      "Cybersecurity risk is an important, constant, and evolving focus for AIG and the insurance and financial services industries in general. The goal of unauthorized parties, using a variety of attack methods, is to gain access to AIG’s data and systems to obtain confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage. One such example, is the increased sophistication and activities of unauthorized parties using phishing in an attempt to access our and our service providers’ systems, usually in an effort to obtain sensitive information, which is an ever-present and increasing attack vector against AIG and our service providers. Cybersecurity risks may also derive from unintentional human error or intentional malice on the part of AIG employees or third parties who have authorized access to AIG’s systems or information.\n",
      "ERM works closely with and supports the risk management practices of Information Technology, the Information Security Office and the business units and functions that form the lines of defense against the cybersecurity risks that we face. This includes the risks that emerge as a result of the execution of our business strategies and our corresponding exposure to new products, clients, service providers, industry segments and regions. AIG seeks to mitigate these risks through initiatives such as investments in technological infrastructure, education and training for employees and vendors, and monitoring of industry developments. As part of our overarching cybersecurity strategy, ERM monitors and assesses the programs designed to remediate our exposures and enhance our systems and applications security.\n",
      "AIG’s Board of Directors and its Technology Committee are regularly briefed by management on AIG’s cybersecurity matters, including threats, policies, practices and ongoing efforts to improve security. As part of our disclosure controls and procedures, the Cyber Incident Management team, a cross functional group, is responsible for ensuring that the members of management responsible for disclosure controls are informed in a timely manner of known cybersecurity risks and incidents that may materially impact our operations so that timely notifications and public disclosures can be made as appropriate. There is no guarantee that the measures AIG takes and the resources AIG devotes to protect against cybersecurity risk will provide absolute security or recoverability of AIG’s systems given the complexity and frequency of the risk which AIG may not always be able to anticipate or adequately address.

      "Overview\n",
      "Insurance risk is defined as the risk of actual claims experience and/or policyholder behavior being materially different than initially expected at the inception of an insurance contract. Uncertainties related to insurance risk can lead to deviations in magnitude and/or timing of prospective cash flows associated with our liabilities compared to what we expected.\n",
      "Except as described above, we manage our business risk oversight activities through our insurance operations. A primary goal in managing our insurance operations is to achieve an acceptable risk-adjusted return on equity. To achieve this goal, we must be disciplined in risk selection, premium adequacy, and appropriate terms and conditions to cover the risk accepted.\n",
      "We operate our insurance businesses on a global basis, and we are exposed to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. We manage these risks throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of processes and procedures, including, but not limited to:\n",
      " pricing and risk selection models including regular monitoring;\n",
      " pricing approval processes;\n",
      " pre-launch approval of product design, development and distribution;\n",

      " risk transfer tools such as reinsurance, both internal and third-party;\n",
      " review and challenge of reserves to ensure comprehensive analysis with established escalation procedures to provide appropriate transparency in reserving decisions and judgments made in the establishment of reserves;\n",
      " management of relationship between assets and liabilities, including hedging;\n",
      " model risk management and validation processes; and\n",
      " experience monitoring and assumption updates.\n",
      "We closely manage insurance risk by monitoring and controlling the nature and geographic location of the risks in each underwritten line of business, concentrations in industries, the terms and conditions of the underwriting and the premiums we charge for taking on the risk. We analyze concentrations of risks using various modeling techniques, including both probability distributions (stochastic) and/or single-point estimates (deterministic) approaches.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Insurance risks are monitored at the business unit level and overseen by the business unit’s chief risk officer. As part of our established governance practices, key decisions and considerations related to insurance risks can, and in certain instances, must be raised and deferred for discussion and consideration to the business unit’s risk committees that are chaired by the business unit’s chief risk officer. In addition, in some business units, pricing committees review insurance risk considerations associated with pricing of new insurance products. The insurance risk oversight framework includes the following key components:\n",
      " articulation of risk appetite by line of business that integrates strategy, financial objectives and capital resources;\n",
      " written policies that define the rules for our insurance risk-taking activities;\n",
      " a limit / threshold framework focused on key insurance risks that aligns with our Board-approved risk appetite statement;\n",

We manage risks in the General Insurance business through aggregations and limitations of concentrations at multiple levels: policy, line of business, geography, industry and legal entity.\n",
      " Life and Retirement companies - risks include mortality and morbidity in the individual and group life insurance and health coverage products, longevity risk in the individual retirement, group retirement and institutional markets products, and policyholder behavior across all product lines. We manage risks through product design, sound medical and non-medical underwriting and at times hedging instruments in the market.\n",
      "We purchase reinsurance for our insurance and reinsurance operations. Reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. We may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis. Pooling of our reinsurance risks enables us to purchase reinsurance more efficiently at a consolidated level, manage global counterparty risk and relationships and manage global catastrophe risks.\n",

      "For further information on our three-tiered hierarchy of limits see Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification and Measurement - Risk Limits.\n",
      "General Insurance Companies’ Key Risks\n",
      "We manage our risks through risk review and selection processes, exposure limitations, exclusions, deductibles, self-insured retentions, coverage limits, attachment points, and reinsurance. This management is supported by sound underwriting practices, pricing procedures and the use of actuarial analysis to help determine overall adequacy of provisions for insurance. Underwriting practices and pricing procedures incorporate historical experience, changes in underlying exposure, current regulation and judicial decisions as well as proposed or anticipated regulatory changes or societal trends.\n",
      "166 AIG | 2020 Form 10-K\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "For General Insurance companies, risks primarily include the following:\n",
      " Loss Reserves - The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the General Insurance companies. There is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. We manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. For further information see Critical Accounting Estimates - Insurance Liabilities - Loss Reserves.\n",
      " Underwriting - The potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the General Insurance companies’ ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. This may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, or unexpected or increased costs or expenses.\n",
      " Catastrophe Exposure - Our business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect our operating results. Other risks, such as man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n",
      " Single Risk Loss Exposure - Our business is exposed to loss events that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. Events such as fires or explosions can result in loss activity for our clients. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by the Chief Underwriting Officer through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance. Furthermore, single risk loss exposure is managed and monitored on both a segregated and aggregated basis.\n",
      " Reinsurance - Since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated. The inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n",
      "Natural Catastrophe Risk\n",
      "We manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate Probable Maximum Loss (PML) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, modifying our gross underwriting standards, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.\n",
      "We use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. We apply adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.\n",
      "We perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model inefficiencies, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. Lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts that allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.\n",
      "We recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policies to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. For example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. In addition, we provide insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change. Our internal product development, underwriting, and modeling, will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.\n",
      "Our natural catastrophe exposure to primary modeled perils is principally driven by the U.S. and secondarily Japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries and perils. For example, we have exposures to additional perils such as European windstorms and wildfire exposures across multiple countries. Within the U.S., we have significant hurricane exposure in Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, the Northeast U.S. and mid-Atlantic regions. Within the U.S., we have significant earthquake exposure in California and the Pacific Northwest regions. Earthquakes impacting the Pacific Northwest region may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in these regions.\n",

      "Also, the modeled results are based on the assumption that all reinsurers fulfill their obligations to us under the terms of the reinsurance arrangements. However, reinsurance recoverables may not be fully collectible. Therefore, these estimates are inherently uncertain and may not accurately reflect our net exposure, inclusive of credit risk, to these events.\n",

      "Terrorism Risk\n",
      "We actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. We have set risk limits based on modeled losses from certain terrorism attack scenarios. Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model for various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the General Insurance companies’ exposures. Examples of modeled scenarios are conventional bombs of different sizes, anthrax attacks and nuclear attacks.\n",
      "Our largest terrorism concentrations are in New York City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers’ Compensation lines of business. At our largest exposure location, modeled losses for a five-ton bomb attack net of the TRIPRA and reinsurance recoveries are estimated to be $1.7 billion based on the exposures as of October 1, 2020.\n",
      "Our exposure to terrorism risk in the U.S. is mitigated by TRIPRA in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIPRA covers terrorist attacks within the United States or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law. In 2020, TRIPRA covers 80 percent of insured losses above a deductible. The current estimate of our deductible is approximately $1.8 billion for 2020.\n",
      "We offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. We also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n",
      "Life and Retirement Companies’ Key Risks\n",
      "We manage risk through product design, experience monitoring, pricing and underwriting discipline, risk limits and thresholds, reinsurance and active monitoring and management of the alignment between risk and cash flow profiles of assets and liabilities, and hedging instruments.\n",
      "For Life and Retirement companies, risks include the following:\n",
      " Longevity risk - represents the risk of an increase in liabilities associated with an insurance product, e.g. an annuity policy or a payout benefit as a result of actual mortality experience being lower than the expected mortality experience. This risk could arise from medical advancement and longer-term societal health changes. This risk exists in a number of our product lines but is most significant for our annuity products.\n",
      " Morbidity risk - represents the risk arising from actual morbidity (e.g. illness, disability or disease) incidence rate being higher than expected or the length of the claims extending longer than expected resulting in a higher overall benefit payout. This risk could arise from longer-term adverse societal health changes or from medical advances in detection and treatment for various diseases and medical conditions resulting in higher claims. This risk exists in a number of our product lines such as accident and health and long-term care businesses which for the most part are in run-off, and ceded to Fortitude Re and the U.S. group benefits which AIG has exited.\n",
      " Mortality (including Pandemic) risk - represents the risk of unexpected loss arising from current actual mortality experience being higher than expected mortality experience. This risk could arise from pandemics or other events, including longer-term societal changes or slower emergence of mortality improvements that cause higher-than-expected current mortality rates. This risk exists in a number of our product lines, but is most significant for our life insurance products.\n",
      " Policyholder behavior risk (including full and partial surrender/lapses) - represents the risk that actual policyholder behavior differs from expected behavior in a manner that has an adverse effect on our operating results. There are many related assumptions made when products are sold, including how long the contracts will persist and other assumptions which impact the expected utilization of contract benefits, options and guarantees. Actual experience can vary significantly from these assumptions. This risk is impacted by a number of factors including changes in market conditions, especially changes in the levels of yields, equity prices, tax law, regulations, competitive landscape and policyholder preferences. This risk exists in many of our product lines, but most notably within the individual annuity and life portfolio of business.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "The emergence of significant adverse experience compared to the experience we expected and priced for could require an adjustment to benefit reserves and/or DAC, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations for a particular period.\n",
      "For additional discussion of the impact of actual and expected experience on DAC and benefit reserves see Critical Accounting Estimates - Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health Insurance Contracts and Critical Accounting Estimates - Guaranteed Benefit Features of Variable Annuity Products. For additional discussion of business risks see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Business and Operations.\n",
      "Variable Annuity, Index Annuity and Universal Life Risk Management and Hedging Programs\n",
      "Our Individual and Group Retirement businesses offer variable and index annuity products with guaranteed living benefit (GLB) riders that guarantee a certain level of lifetime income. Variable and certain index annuity GLBs are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses). GLB features subject the Life and Retirement companies to market risk, including exposure to changes in levels of interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility.\n",
      "Product design is the first step in managing our exposure to these market risks. Risk mitigation features of our variable annuity product designs include GLB rider fees indexed to an equity market volatility index, which can provide additional fee assessments in periods of increased market volatility, required minimum allocations to fixed accounts to reduce overall equity exposure, and for some of the variable annuity products, the utilization of volatility control funds, which have an ability to adjust equity exposures in these funds in response to changes in market volatility, even under sudden or extreme market movements.\n",
      "We utilize asset liability management and hedging programs to manage economic exposure to market risks that are not fully mitigated through product designs. Our hedging program is designed to offset certain changes in the economic value of embedded derivatives associated with our variable annuity, index annuity and index universal life liabilities, within established thresholds. The hedging program is designed to provide additional protection against large and combined movements in levels of interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility under multiple scenarios.\n",
      "Our hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents our estimate of the underlying economic risks in the embedded derivatives. For example, for variable annuity GLBs, the hedge targets are calculated as a difference between present value of the future expected benefit payments for the GLB and the present value of future GLB rider fees, with present values determined over numerous equally weighted stochastic scenarios. This stochastic projection method uses best estimate assumptions for policyholder behavior (including mortality, lapses, withdrawals and benefit utilization) in conjunction with market scenarios calibrated to observable equity and interest rate option prices. Policyholder behaviors are regularly monitored to compare current assumptions to actual experience and, if appropriate, changes are made to the policyholder behavior assumptions. The risk of changes in policyholder behavior is not explicitly hedged, and such differences between expected and actual policyholder behaviors will result in hedge ineffectiveness.\n",
      "Due to differences between the calculation of the value of the economic hedge target and the U.S. GAAP valuation of the embedded derivative, which include differences in the treatment of rider fees and exclusion of certain risk margins and other differences in discount rates, we expect relative movements in the value of the economic hedge target and the U.S. GAAP embedded derivative valuation will vary over time with changes in levels of equity markets, interest rates, credit spreads and volatility.\n",
      "For information on the impact on our consolidated pre-tax income from the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives and the hedging portfolio, as well as additional discussion of differences between the economic hedge target and the valuation of the embedded derivatives see Insurance Reserves - Life and Annuity Reserves and DAC - Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefits and Hedging Results.\n",
      "In designing the hedging portfolio for our variable annuity hedging program, we make assumptions and projections about the future performance of the underlying mutual funds. We use these assumptions to project future policy level account value changes. We map the mutual funds to a set of publicly traded indices that we believe best represent the liability to be hedged. Basis risk exists due to the variance between fund returns projected under these assumptions and actual fund returns, which may result in variances between changes in the value of the hedging portfolio and changes in the economic value of the hedge target. Net hedge results and the associated cost of hedging are also impacted by differences between realized volatility and implied volatility.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "Our hedging programs associated with index annuity and index universal life products, are designed to manage market risk associated with the index crediting strategies offered on these product platforms. These hedging programs are designed to offset economic risk arising in conjunction with index returns, associated with the crediting strategies that will be occurring during the current crediting rate reset period. Similarly, as with the variable annuities, there are differences between the calculation of the value of the economic hedge target and the U.S. GAAP valuation of the index annuity and index life embedded derivatives, which can lead to variances in their relative movements.\n",
      "To manage the capital market exposures embedded within the economic hedge target, we identify and hedge market sensitivities to changes in equity markets, interest rates, volatility and for variable annuities, credit spreads. Each hedge program purchases derivative instruments or securities having sensitivities that offset corresponding sensitivities in the associated economic hedge targets, within internally defined threshold limits. Since the relative movements of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target vary over time or with market changes, the net exposure can be outside the threshold limits, and adjustments to the hedging portfolio are made periodically to return the net exposure to within the threshold limits.\n",
      "Our hedging programs utilize various derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts, interest rate swaps and swaptions, as well as other hedging instruments. In addition, within the variable annuities hedging program, we purchase certain fixed income securities. To minimize counterparty credit risk, the majority of the derivative instruments utilized within the hedging programs are cleared through global exchanges. Over the counter derivatives utilized within the hedging programs are highly collateralized.\n",
      "The hedging programs are monitored on a daily basis to ensure that the economic hedge targets and the associated derivative portfolios are within the threshold limits, pursuant to the approved hedging strategies. Daily risk monitoring verifies that the net risk exposures are within the approved net risk exposure threshold limits. In addition, monthly stress tests are performed to determine the program’s effectiveness relative to the applicable limits, under an array of combined severe market stresses in equity prices, interest rates, volatility and credit spreads. Finally, hedging strategies are reviewed regularly to gauge their effectiveness and continued applicability in managing our market exposures in the context of our overall risk appetite.\n",
      "Reinsurance Activities\n",
      "Reinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss (Life and Non-Life) exposure related to certain events, such as natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, or single policy level events. Our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.\n",
      "Reinsurance markets include:\n",
      " Traditional local and global reinsurance markets including those in the United States, Bermuda, London and Europe, accessed directly and through reinsurance intermediaries;\n",
      " Capital markets through insurance-linked securities and collateralized reinsurance transactions, such as catastrophe bonds, sidecars and similar vehicles; and\n",
      " Other insurers that engage in both direct and assumed reinsurance.\n",
      "The form of reinsurance we may choose from time to time will generally depend on whether we are seeking:\n",
      " proportional reinsurance, whereby we cede a specified percentage of premiums and losses to reinsurers;\n",
      " non-proportional or excess of loss reinsurance, whereby we cede all or a specified portion of losses in excess of a specified amount on a per risk, per occurrence (including catastrophe reinsurance) or aggregate basis; or\n",
      " facultative contracts that reinsure individual policies.\n",
      "We continually evaluate the relative attractiveness of different forms of reinsurance contracts and different markets that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives.\n",
      "Reinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. However, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.\n",
      "In certain markets, we are required to participate on a proportional basis in reinsurance pools based on our relative share of direct writings in those markets. Such mandatory reinsurance generally covers higher-risk consumer exposures such as assigned-risk automobile and earthquake, as well as certain commercial exposures such as workers’ compensation.\n",

      "Reinsurance Recoverable\n",
      "AIG’s reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of:\n",
      " Paid losses recoverable - balances due from reinsurers for losses and loss adjustment expenses paid by our subsidiaries and billed, but not yet collected.\n",
      " Ceded loss reserves - ultimate ceded reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, including reserves for claims reported but not yet paid and estimates for IBNR.\n",
      " Ceded reserves for unearned premiums.\n",
      " Life and Annuity reinsurance recoverables (ceded policy and claim reserves and policyholder contract deposits).\n",
      "At December 31, 2020, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $73.5 billion. These assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $2.8 billion, ceded loss reserves of $34.5 billion including reserves for IBNR claims, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $4.1 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverable of $32.1 billion. The methods used to estimate IBNR and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. These methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments are reflected in income. We believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at December 31, 2020 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. Actual losses may, however, differ from the reserves currently ceded.\n",
      "The Reinsurance Credit Department (RCD) conducts periodic detailed assessments of the financial strength and condition of current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic. The RCD monitors both the financial condition of reinsurers as well as the total reinsurance recoverable ceded to reinsurers, and sets limits with regard to the amount and type of exposure we are willing to take with reinsurers. As part of these assessments, we attempt to identify whether a reinsurer is appropriately licensed, assess its financial capacity and liquidity, and evaluate the local economic and financial environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates. The RCD reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for measures, including collateral to mitigate credit risk. For example, in our treaty reinsurance contracts, we frequently include provisions that require a reinsurer to post collateral or use other measures to reduce exposure when a referenced event occurs. Furthermore, we limit our unsecured exposure to reinsurers through the use of credit triggers such as insurer financial strength rating downgrades, declines in regulatory capital, or relevant RBC ratios fall below certain levels. We also set maximum limits for reinsurance recoverable exposure, which in some cases is the recoverable amount plus an estimate of the maximum potential exposure from unexpected events for a reinsurer. In addition, credit executives within ERM review reinsurer exposures and credit limits and approve reinsurer credit limits above specified levels. Finally, even where we conclude that uncollateralized credit risk is acceptable, we require collateral from active reinsurance counterparties where it is necessary for our subsidiaries to recognize the reinsurance recoverable assets for statutory accounting purposes. At December 31, 2020, we held $79.4 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers.\n",
      "The following table presents information for each reinsurer representing in excess of five percent of our total reinsurance recoverable assets:\n",
      "(a) The financial strength ratings reflect the ratings of the various reinsurance subsidiaries of the companies listed as of January 20, 2021.\n",

      "At December 31, 2020, we had no significant reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. Reduced profitability associated with lower interest rates, market volatility and catastrophe losses (including COVID-19), could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. The RCD, in conjunction with the credit executives within ERM, reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require the reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.\n",

      "We utilize derivatives principally to enable us to hedge exposure associated with changes in levels of interest rates, currencies, credit, commodities, equity prices and other risks. Credit risk associated with derivative counterparties exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to us. The maximum potential exposure will increase or decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions. All derivative transactions must be transacted within counterparty limits that have been approved by ERM.\n",
      "We evaluate counterparty credit quality via an internal analysis that is consistent with the AIG Credit Policy. We utilize various credit enhancements, including letters of credit, guarantees, collateral, credit triggers, credit derivatives, margin agreements and subordination to reduce the credit risk related to outstanding financial derivative transactions. We require credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties, and transaction size and maturity. Furthermore, we enter into certain agreements that have the benefit of set-off and close-out netting provisions, such as ISDA Master Agreements. These provisions provide that, in the case of an early termination of a transaction, we can set off receivables from a counterparty against payables to the same counterparty arising out of all covered transactions. As a result, where a legally enforceable netting agreement exists, the fair value of the transaction with the counterparty represents the net sum of estimated fair values.\n",

      "-Ratios: We, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses (which for General Insurance excludes net loss reserve discount), and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. Our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under GAAP, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios.\n",
      "-Accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted: both the accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. Natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on AIG in excess of $10 million each and man-made catastrophe losses, such as terrorism and civil disorders that exceed the $10 million threshold. We believe that as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of management’s control. We also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results.\n",

      "the relative weights given to these models by product line;\n",
      "the underlying assumptions used in these models; and\n",
      "the determination of the appropriate groupings of similar product lines and, in some cases, the disaggregation of dissimilar losses within a product line.\n",
      "We use numerous assumptions in determining the best estimate of reserves for each line of business. The importance of any specific assumption can vary by both line of business and accident year. Because actual experience can differ from key assumptions used in establishing reserves, there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves. This is particularly true for long-tail classes of business.\n",
      "All of our methods to calculate net reserves include assumptions about estimated reinsurance recoveries and their collectability. Reinsurance collectability is evaluated independently of the reserving process and appropriate allowances for uncollectible reinsurance are established.\n",
      "AIG | 2019 Form 10-K 45\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Critical Accounting Estimates\n",
      "Overview of Loss Reserving Process and Methods\n",
      "Our loss reserves can generally be categorized into two distinct groups. Short-tail reserves consists principally of U.S. Property and Special Risks, Europe Property and Special Risks, U.S. Personal Insurance, and Europe and Japan Personal Insurance. Long-tail reserves include U.S. Workers’ Compensation, U.S. Excess Casualty, U.S. Other Casualty, U.S. Financial Lines, Europe Casualty and Financial Lines, and U.S. Run-Off Long Tail Insurance Lines.\n",
      "Short-Tail Reserves\n",
      "For our short-tail coverages, such as property, where the nature of claims is generally high frequency with short reporting periods, with volatility arising from occasional severe events, the process for recording non-catastrophe quarterly loss reserves is geared toward maintaining IBNR based on percentages of net earned premiums for that business, rather than projecting ultimate loss ratios based on reported losses. For example, the IBNR reserve required for the latest accident quarter for a product line such as homeowners might be approximately 20 percent of the quarter’s earned premiums. This level of reserve would generally be recorded regardless of the actual losses reported in the current quarter, thus recognizing severe events as they occur. The percent of premium factor reflects both our expectation of the ultimate loss costs associated with the line of business and the expectation of the percentage of ultimate loss costs that have not yet been reported. The expected ultimate loss costs generally reflect the average loss costs from a period of preceding accident quarters that have been adjusted for changes in rate and loss cost levels, mix of business, known exposure to unreported losses, or other factors affecting the particular line of business. The expected percentage of ultimate loss costs that have not yet been reported would be derived from historical loss emergence patterns. For more mature quarters, specific loss development methods would be used to determine the IBNR. For other product lines where the nature of claims is high frequency but low severity, methods including loss development, frequency/severity or a multiple of average monthly losses may be used to determine IBNR reserves. IBNR for claims arising from catastrophic events or events of unusual severity would be determined in close collaboration with the claims department’s knowledge of known information, using alternative techniques or expected percentages of ultimate loss cost emergence based on historical loss emergence of similar claim types.\n",
      "Long-Tail Reserves\n",
      "Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss adjustment expenses (net losses) for our long-tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the product line and volume of business, as well as estimates of reinsurance recoveries. Experience in the more recent accident years generally provides limited statistical credibility of reported net losses on long-tail casualty lines of business. That is because in the more recent accident years, a relatively low proportion of estimated ultimate net incurred losses are reported or paid. Therefore, IBNR reserves constitute a relatively high proportion of net losses.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Critical Accounting Estimates\n",
      "We record quarterly changes in loss reserves for each product line of business. The overall change in our loss reserves is based on the sum of the changes for all product lines of business. For most long-tail product lines of business, the quarterly loss reserve changes are based on the estimated current loss ratio for each subset of coverage less any amounts paid. Also, any change in estimated ultimate losses from prior accident years deemed to be necessary based on the results of our latest detailed valuation reviews, large loss analyses, or other analytical techniques, either positive or negative, is reflected in the loss reserve and incurred losses for the current quarter. Differences between actual loss emergence in a given period and our expectations based on prior loss reserve estimates are used to monitor reserve adequacy between detailed valuation reviews and may also influence our judgment with respect to adjusting reserve estimates.\n",
      "Details of the Loss Reserving Process\n",
      "The process of determining the current loss ratio for each product line of business is based on a variety of factors. These include considerations such as: prior accident year and policy year loss ratios; rate changes; and changes in coverage, reinsurance, or mix of business. Other considerations include actual and anticipated changes in external factors such as trends in loss costs, inflation, employment rates or unemployment duration or in the legal and claims environment. The current loss ratio for each product line of business is intended to represent our best estimate after reflecting all of the relevant factors. At the close of each quarter, the assumptions and data underlying the loss ratios are reviewed to determine whether the loss ratios remain appropriate. This process includes a review of the actual loss experience in the quarter, actual rate changes achieved, actual changes in reinsurance, quantifiable changes in coverage or mix of business, and changes in other factors that may affect the loss ratio. When this review suggests that the previously determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate, the loss ratio is changed to reflect the revised estimates.\n",
      "We conduct a comprehensive loss detailed valuation review at least annually for each product line of business in accordance with Actuarial Standards of Practice. These standards provide that the unpaid loss estimate may be presented in a variety of ways, such as a point estimate, a range of estimates, a point estimate based on the expected value of several reasonable estimates, or a probability distribution of the unpaid loss amount. Our actuarial best estimate for each product line of business represents an expected value generally considering a range of reasonably possible outcomes.\n",
      "The reserve analysis for each product line of business is performed by a credentialed actuarial team in collaboration with claims, underwriting, business unit management, risk management and senior management. Our actuaries consider the ongoing applicability of prior data groupings and update numerous assumptions, including the analysis and selection of loss development and loss trend factors. They also determine and select the appropriate actuarial or other methods used to estimate reserve adequacy for each business product line, and may employ multiple methods and assumptions for each product line. These data groupings, accident year weights, method selections and assumptions necessarily change over time as business mix changes, development factors mature and become more credible and loss characteristics evolve. In the course of these detailed valuation reviews an actuarial best estimate of the loss reserve is determined. The sum of these estimates for each product line of business yields an overall actuarial best estimate for that line of business.\n",
      "For certain product lines, we measure sensitivities and determine explicit ranges around the actuarial best estimate using multiple methodologies and varying assumptions. Where we have ranges, we use them to inform our selection of best estimates of loss reserves by major product line of business. Our range of reasonable estimates is not intended to cover all possibilities or extreme values and is based on known data and facts at the time of estimation.\n",
      "We consult with third-party environmental litigation and engineering specialists, third-party toxic tort claims professionals, third-party clinical and public health specialists, third-party workers’ compensation claims adjusters and third-party actuarial advisors to help inform our judgments, as needed.\n",
      "A critical component of our detailed valuation reviews is an internal peer review of our reserving analyses and conclusions, where actuaries independent of the initial review evaluate the reasonableness of assumptions used, methods selected and weightings given to different methods. In addition, each detailed valuation review is subjected to a review and challenge process by specialists in our Enterprise Risk Management group.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Critical Accounting Estimates\n",
      "Actuarial and Other Methods for Major Lines of Business\n",
      "Our actuaries determine the appropriate actuarial methods and segmentation. This determination is based on a variety of factors including the nature of the losses associated with the product line of business, such as the frequency or severity of the claims. In addition to determining the actuarial methods, the actuaries determine the appropriate loss reserve groupings of data. This determination is a judgmental, dynamic process and refinements to the groupings are made every year. The changes to groupings may be driven by and may change to reflect observed or emerging patterns within and across product lines, or to differentiate different risk characteristics (for example, size of deductibles and extent of third-party claims specialists used by our insureds). As an example of reserve segmentation, we write many unique subsets of professional liability, which cover different products, industry segments, and coverage structures. While for pricing or other purposes, it may be appropriate to evaluate the profitability of each subset individually, we believe it is appropriate to combine the subsets into larger groups for reserving purposes to produce a greater degree of credibility in the loss experience. This determination of data segmentation and related actuarial methods is assessed, reviewed and updated at least annually.\n",
      "The actuarial methods we use most commonly include paid and incurred loss development methods, expected loss ratio methods, including “Bornhuetter Ferguson” and “Cape Cod”, and frequency/severity models. Loss development methods utilize the actual loss development patterns from prior accident years updated through the current year to project the reported losses to an ultimate basis for all accident years. We also use this information to update our current accident year loss selections. Loss development methods are generally most appropriate for classes of business that exhibit a stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next, and for which the components of the product line have similar development characteristics. For example, property exposures would generally not be combined into the same product line as casualty exposures, and primary casualty exposures would generally not be combined into the same product line as excess casualty exposures. We continually refine our loss reserving techniques and adopt further segmentations based on our analysis of differing emerging loss patterns for certain product lines. We generally use expected loss ratio methods in cases where the reported loss data lacked sufficient credibility to utilize loss development methods, such as for new product lines of business or for long-tail product lines at early stages of loss development. Frequency/severity models may be used where sufficient frequency counts are available to apply such approaches.\n",
      "Expected loss ratio methods rely on the application of an expected loss ratio to the earned premium for the product line of business to determine the liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses. For example, an expected loss ratio of 70 percent applied to an earned premium base of $10 million for a product line of business would generate an ultimate loss estimate of $7 million. Subtracting any paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve for this product line. Under the Bornhuetter Ferguson methods, the expected loss ratio is applied only to the expected unreported portion of the losses. For example, for a long-tail product line of business for which only 10 percent of the losses are expected to be reported at the end of the accident year, the expected loss ratio would be used to represent the 90 percent of losses still unreported. The actual reported losses at the end of the accident year would be added to determine the total ultimate loss estimate for the accident year. Subtracting the reported paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve. In the example above, the expected loss ratio of 70 percent would be multiplied by 90 percent. The result of 63 percent would be applied to the earned premium of $10 million resulting in an estimated unreported loss of $6.3 million. Actual reported losses would be added to arrive at the total ultimate losses. If the reported losses were $1 million, the ultimate loss estimate under the Bornhuetter Ferguson method would be $7.3 million versus the $7 million amount under the expected loss ratio method described above. Thus, the Bornhuetter Ferguson method gives partial credibility to the actual loss experience to date for the product line of business. Loss development methods generally give full credibility to the reported loss experience to date. In the example above, loss development methods would typically indicate an ultimate loss estimate of $10 million, as the reported losses of $1 million would be estimated to reflect only 10 percent of the ultimate losses.\n",
      "48 AIG | 2019 Form 10-K\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Critical Accounting Estimates\n",
      "A key advantage of loss development methods is that they respond more quickly to any actual changes in loss costs for the product line of business. Therefore, if loss experience is unexpectedly deteriorating or improving, the loss development method gives full credibility to the changing experience. Expected loss ratio methods would be slower to respond to the change, as they would continue to give more weight to a prior expected loss ratio, until enough evidence emerged to modify the expected loss ratio to reflect the changing loss experience. On the other hand, loss development methods have the disadvantage of overreacting to changes in reported losses if the loss experience is anomalous due to the various key factors described above and the inherent volatility in some of the classes. For example, the presence or absence of large losses at the early stages of loss development could cause the loss development method to overreact to the favorable or unfavorable experience by assuming it is a fundamental shift in the development pattern. In these instances, expected loss ratio methods such as Bornhuetter Ferguson have the advantage of recognizing large losses without extrapolating unusual large loss activity onto the unreported portion of the losses for the accident year.\n",
      "The Cape Cod method is a hybrid between the loss development and Bornhuetter Ferguson methods, where the historic loss data and loss development factor assumptions are used to determine the expected loss ratio estimate in the Bornhuetter Ferguson method.\n",
      "Frequency/severity methods generally rely on the determination of an ultimate number of claims and an average severity for each claim for each accident year. Multiplying the estimated ultimate number of claims for each accident year by the expected average severity of each claim produces the estimated ultimate loss for the accident year. Frequency/severity methods generally require a sufficient volume of claims in order for the average severity to be predictable. Average severity for subsequent accident years is generally determined by applying an estimated annual loss cost trend to the estimated average claim severity from prior accident years. In certain cases, a structural approach may also be used to predict the ultimate loss cost. Frequency/severity methods have the advantage that ultimate claim counts can generally be estimated more quickly and accurately than can ultimate losses. Thus, if the average claim severity can be accurately estimated, these methods can more quickly respond to changes in loss experience than other methods. However, for average severity to be predictable, the product line of business must consist of homogenous types of claims for which loss severity trends from one year to the next are reasonably consistent and where there are limited changes to deductible levels or limits. Generally these methods work best for high frequency, low severity product lines of business such as personal auto. However, frequency and severity metrics are also used to test the reasonability of results for other product lines of business and provide indications of underlying trends in the data. In addition, ultimate claim counts can be used as an alternative exposure measure to earned premiums in the Cape Cod method.\n",
      "Structural driver analytics seek to explain the underlying drivers of frequency/severity. A structural driver analysis of frequency/severity is particularly useful for understanding the key drivers of uncertainty in the ultimate loss cost. For example, for the excess workers’ compensation product line of business, we have attempted to corroborate our judgment by considering the impact on severity of the future potential for deterioration of an injured worker’s medical condition, the impact of price inflation on the various categories of medical expense and cost of living adjustments on indemnity benefits, the impact of injured worker mortality and claim specific settlement and loss mitigation strategies, etc., using the following:\n",
      "Claim by claim reviews, often facilitated by third-party specialists, to determine the stability and likelihood of settling an injured worker’s indemnity and medical benefits;\n",
      "Analysis of the potential for future deterioration in medical condition unlikely to be picked up by a claim file review and associated with potentially costly medical procedures (i.e., increases in both utilization and intensity of medical care) over the course of the injured worker’s lifetime;\n",
      "Analysis of the cost of medical price inflation for each category of medical spend (services and devices) and for cost of living adjustments in line with statutory requirements;\n",

      "In recent years, we have expanded our analysis of structural drivers to additional product lines of business as a means of corroborating our judgments using traditional actuarial techniques. For example, we have explicitly used external estimates of future medical inflation and mortality in estimating the loss development tail for excess of deductible primary workers’ compensation business. Using external forecasts for items such as these can improve the accuracy and stability of our estimates.\n",
      "The estimation of liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental pollution losses on insurance policies written many years ago is typically subject to greater uncertainty than other types of losses. This is due to inconsistent court decisions, as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies or have expanded theories of liability. In addition, reinsurance recoverable balances relating to asbestos and environmental loss reserves are subject to greater uncertainty due to the underlying age of the claim, underlying legal issues surrounding the nature of the coverage, and determination of proper policy period. For these reasons, these balances tend to be subject to increased levels of disputes and legal collection activity when actually billed. The insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures.\n",
      "We continue to receive claims asserting injuries and damages from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged claims to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites, referred to collectively as environmental claims, and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. The vast majority of these asbestos and environmental losses emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained absolute exclusions for pollution-related damage and asbestos. The current environmental policies that we specifically price and underwrite for environmental risks on a claims-made basis have been excluded from the analysis.\n",
      "The majority of our exposures for asbestos and environmental losses are related to excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. The litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity amounts, with litigation expenses included within the limits of the liability we incur. Individual significant loss reserves, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case-by-case basis.\n",

      "Compensation\n",
      "We generally use a combination of loss development and expected loss ratio methods for U.S. Workers’ Compensation as this line of business is long-tail.\n",
      "The loss cost trend assumption is not believed to be material with respect to our guaranteed cost loss reserves. This is primarily because our actuaries are generally able to use loss development projections for all but the most recent accident year’s reserves, so there is limited need to rely on loss cost trend assumptions for primary workers’ compensation business.\n",
      "The tail factor is typically the most critical assumption, and small changes in the selected tail factor can have a material effect on our carried reserves. For example, the tail factors beyond twenty years for guaranteed cost business could vary by one and one-half percent below to two percent above those actually indicated in the 2019 loss reserve review. For excess of deductible business, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that tail factors beyond twenty years could vary by four percent below to six percent above those actually indicated in the 2019 loss reserve review.\n",

      "Key Assumptions\n",
      "U.S. Excess Casualty\n",
      "We utilize various loss cost trend assumptions for different segments of the portfolio. After evaluating the historical loss cost trends from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss cost trends applicable to the year-end 2019 loss reserve review for U.S. Excess Casualty may range five percent lower or higher than this estimated loss trend. The loss cost trend assumption is critical for the U.S. Excess Casualty class of business due to the long-tail nature of the losses, and is applied across many accident years. Thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years (the expected loss ratio years) to be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends that were initially relied upon in setting the loss reserves. These changes in loss trends could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.\n",
      "U.S. Excess Casualty is a long-tail class of business and any deviation in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. Mass tort claims in particular may develop over a very extended period and impact multiple accident years, so we usually select a separate pattern for them. Thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years to be significantly affected by changes in loss development factors that were initially relied upon in setting the reserves.\n",
      "After evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the actual loss development factors could vary by an amount equivalent to a six month shift from those actually utilized in the year-end 2019 reserve review. This would impact projections both for accident years where the selections were directly based on loss development methods as well as the a priori loss ratio assumptions for accident years with selections based on Bornhuetter-Ferguson or Cape Cod methods. Similar to loss cost trends, these changes in loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.\n",
      "U.S. Other Casualty\n",
      "The key uncertainties for other casualty lines are similar to excess casualty, as the underlying business is long-tailed and can be subject to variability in loss cost trends and changes in loss development factors. These may differ significantly by line of business as coverages such as general liability, medical malpractice and environmental may be subject to different risk drivers.\n",
      "U.S. Financial Lines\n",
      "The loss cost trends for U.S. Directors and Officers (D&O) liability business vary by year and subset, but for the most recent accident years, it is assumed to have been generally close to zero. After evaluating the historical loss cost levels from prior accident years since the early 1990s, including the potential effect of losses relating to the credit crisis, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the actual variation in loss cost levels for these subsets could vary by approximately 10 percent lower or higher on a year-over-year basis than the assumptions actually utilized in the year-end 2019 reserve review. Because U.S. D&O business has exhibited highly volatile loss trends from one accident year to the next, there is the possibility of an exceptionally high deviation. In our analysis, the effects of loss cost trend assumptions affect the results through the a priori loss ratio assumptions used for the Bornhuetter-Ferguson and Cape Cod methods, which impact the projections for the more recent accident years.\n",
      "The selected loss development factors are also an important assumption, but are less critical than for U.S. Excess Casualty. Because these classes are written on a claims made basis, the loss reporting and development tail is much shorter than for U.S. Excess Casualty. However, the high severity nature of the losses does create the potential for significant deviations in loss development patterns from one year to the next. Similar to U.S. Excess Casualty, after evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss development factors could change by an amount equivalent to a shift by six months from those actually utilized in the year-end 2019 reserve review.\n",
      "Europe Casualty and Financial Lines\n",

      "We historically have used a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for excess workers’ compensation and other run-off segments. For environmental claims, we have utilized a variety of methods including traditional loss development approaches, claim department and other expert evaluations of the ultimate costs for certain claims and survival ratio metrics.\n",
      "U.S. Run-Off Long Tail Insurance lines is an extremely long-tail class of business, with a much greater than normal uncertainty as to the appropriate loss development factors for the tail of the loss development. Specifically for excess workers’ compensation, after evaluating the historical loss development factors for prior accident years since the 1980s as well as the development over the past several years of the ground up loss projections utilized to help select the loss development factors in the tail for this class of business, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the tail factor beyond 30 years could vary by 10 percent above or below that actually indicated in the 2019 loss reserve review.\n",
      "Other Reserve Items\n",
      "Loss adjustment expenses (LAE) are separated into two broad categories: allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE), also referred to as legal defense and cost containment or “legal” and unallocated loss adjustment expenses, which includes certain claims adjuster fees and other internal claim management costs.\n",
      "We determine reserves for legal expenses for each class of business by one or more actuarial or structural driver methods. For the majority of segments, legal costs are analyzed in conjunction with losses. For segments where they are separately analyzed the methods used generally include development methods comparable to those described for loss development methods. The development could be based on either the paid loss adjustment expenses or the ratio of paid loss adjustment expenses to paid losses, or both. Other methods include the utilization of expected ultimate ratios of paid loss expense to paid losses, based on actual experience from prior accident years or from similar product lines of business.\n",
      "The bulk of adjuster expenses are allocated and charged to individual claim files. For these expenses, we generally determine reserves based on calendar year ratios of adjuster expenses paid to losses paid for the particular product line of business. For other internal claim costs, which generally relate to specific claim department expenses that are not allocated to individual claim files such as technology costs and other broad initiatives, we look at historic and expected expenditures for these items and project these into the future.\n",
      "The incidence of LAE is directly related to the frequency, complexity and level of underlying claims. As a result, a key driver of variability in LAE is the variability in the overall claims, particularly for long tail lines.\n",
      "The following sensitivity analysis table summarizes the effect on the loss reserve position of using certain alternative loss cost trend (for accident years where we use expected loss ratio methods) or loss development factor assumptions rather than the assumptions actually used in determining our estimates in the year-end loss reserve analyses in 2019:\n",

      "Long-duration traditional products include whole life insurance, term life insurance, accident and health insurance, long-term care insurance, and certain payout annuities for which the payment period is life-contingent, which include certain of our single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements.\n",
      "For long-duration traditional business, a “lock-in” principle applies. The assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. The assumptions include mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses, and investment returns. These assumptions are typically consistent with pricing inputs. The assumptions also include margins for adverse deviation, principally for key assumptions such as mortality and interest rates used to discount cash flows, to reflect uncertainty given that actual experience might deviate from these assumptions. Establishing margins at contract inception requires management judgment. The extent of the margin for adverse deviation may vary depending on the uncertainty of the cash flows, which is affected by the volatility of the business and the extent of our experience with the product.\n",
      "Loss recognition occurs if observed changes in actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses under loss recognition testing. To determine whether loss recognition exists, we determine whether a future loss is expected based on updated current assumptions. If loss recognition exists, we recognize the loss by first reducing DAC through amortization expense, and, if DAC is depleted, record additional liabilities through a charge to policyholder benefit expense. Because of the long-term nature of many of our liabilities subject to the “lock-in” principle, small changes in certain assumptions may cause large changes in the degree of reserve adequacy. In particular, changes in estimates of future invested asset returns have a large effect on the degree of reserve deficiency.\n",
      "For additional information on loss recognition see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "Groupings for loss recognition testing are consistent with our manner of acquiring, servicing, and measuring the profitability of the business and are applied by product groupings, including traditional life, payout annuities and long-term care insurance. Once loss recognition has been recorded for a block of business, the old assumption set is replaced and the assumption set used for the loss recognition would then be subject to the lock-in principle. Key judgments made in loss recognition testing include the following:\n",
      "To determine investment returns used in loss recognition tests, we typically match liabilities with assets of comparable duration, to the extent practicable, and then project future cash flows on those assets. Assets supporting insurance liabilities are primarily comprised of a diversified portfolio of high to medium quality fixed maturity securities, and may also include, to a lesser extent, alternative investments. Our projections include a reasonable allowance for investment expenses and expected credit losses over the projection horizon. A critical assumption in the projection of expected investment income is the assumed net rate of investment return at which excess cash flows are to be reinvested. For products in which asset and liability durations are matched relatively well, this is less of a consideration since interest on excess cash flows are not a significant component of future cash flows. For the reinvestment rate assumption, anticipated future changes to the yield curves could have a large effect. Given the interest rate environment applicable at the date of our most recent loss recognition tests, we assumed a modest and gradual increase in long-term interest rates over time.\n",
      "For mortality assumptions, key judgments include the extent of industry versus own experience to base future assumptions as well as the extent of expected mortality improvements in the future. The latter judgment is based on a combination of historical mortality trends and advice from industry, public health and demography specialists that were consulted by AIG’s actuaries and published industry information.\n",
      "For surrender rates, a key judgment involves the correlation between expected increases/decreases in interest rates and increases/decreases in surrender rates. To support this judgment, we compare crediting rates on our products to expected rates on competing products under different interest rate scenarios.\n",
      "For in-force long-term care insurance, rate increases are allowed but must be approved by state insurance regulators. Consequently, the extent of rate increases that may be assumed requires judgment. In establishing our assumption for rate increases for long-term care insurance, we consider historical experience as to the frequency and level of rate increases approved by state regulators.\n",

In applying shadow loss recognition, the Company overlays unrealized gains onto loss recognition tests without revising the underlying test.

      "Guaranteed Benefit Features of Variable Annuity Products\n",
      "Variable annuity products offered by our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement product lines offer guaranteed benefit features. These guaranteed features include guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) that are payable in the event of death or other instances, and living benefits that are payable in the event of annuitization, or, in other instances, at specified dates during the accumulation period. Living benefits primarily include guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB).\n",

      "Our exposure to the guaranteed amounts is equal to the amount by which the contract holder’s account balance is below the amount provided by the guaranteed feature. A variable annuity contract may include more than one type of guaranteed benefit feature; for example, it may have both a GMDB and a GMWB. However, a policyholder can generally only receive payout from one guaranteed feature on a contract containing a death benefit and a living benefit, i.e., the features are generally mutually exclusive (except a surviving spouse who has a rider to potentially collect both a GMDB upon their spouse’s death and a GMWB during his or her lifetime). A policyholder cannot purchase more than one living benefit on one contract. Declines in the equity markets, increased volatility and a sustained low interest rate environment increase our exposure to potential benefits under the guaranteed features, leading to an increase in the liabilities for those benefits.\n",

      "In estimating future gross profits for variable annuity products as of December 31, 2019, a long-term annual asset growth assumption of 7.0 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected) was applied to estimate the future growth in assets and related asset-based fees. In determining the asset growth rate, the effect of short-term fluctuations in the equity markets is partially mitigated through the use of a reversion to the mean methodology, whereby short-term asset growth above or below the long-term annual rate assumption impacts the growth assumption applied to the five-year period subsequent to the current balance sheet date. The reversion to the mean methodology allows us to maintain our long-term growth assumptions, while also giving consideration to the effect of actual investment performance. When actual performance significantly deviates from the annual long-term growth assumption, as evidenced by growth assumptions for the five-year reversion to the mean period falling below a certain rate (floor) or above a certain rate (cap) for a sustained period, judgment may be applied to revise or “unlock” the growth rate assumptions to be used for both the five-year reversion to the mean period as well as the long-term annual growth assumption applied to subsequent periods. The use of a reversion to the mean assumption is common within the industry; however, the parameters used in the methodology are subject to judgment and vary within the industry.\n",

      "The following table summarizes the sensitivity of changes in certain assumptions for DAC and SIA, embedded derivatives and other reserves related to guaranteed benefits and URR, measured as the related hypothetical impact on December 31, 2019 balances and the resulting hypothetical impact on pre-tax income, before hedging.\n",

      "Reinsurance Assets\n",
      "The estimation of reinsurance recoverable involves a significant amount of judgment, particularly for latent exposures, such as asbestos, due to their long-tail nature. Reinsurance assets include reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses that are estimated as part of our loss reserving process and, consequently, are subject to similar judgments and uncertainties as the estimation of gross loss reserves.\n",
      "We assess the collectability of reinsurance recoverable balances through either detailed reviews of the underlying nature of the reinsurance balance or comparisons with historical trends of disputes and credit events. We record adjustments to reflect the results of these assessments through an allowance for uncollectable reinsurance that reduces the carrying amount of reinsurance assets on the balance sheet. This estimate requires significant judgment for which key considerations include:\n",
      "paid and unpaid amounts recoverable;\n",
      "whether the balance is in dispute or subject to legal collection;\n",
      "whether the reinsurer is financially troubled (i.e., liquidated, insolvent, in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction); and\n",
      "whether collateral and collateral arrangements exist.\n",
      "At December 31, 2019, the allowance for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance was $111 million, or less than one percent of the consolidated reinsurance recoverable.\n",
      "Risk transfer\n",
      "All insurance contracts, including reinsurance contracts, must meet risk transfer requirements in order to use insurance accounting, principally resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract as premiums and losses. If risk transfer requirements are not met, a contract is to be accounted for as a deposit, typically resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract through a deposit asset or liability and not as revenue or expense. To meet risk transfer requirements, all insurance and reinsurance contracts must include insurance risk, consisting of underwriting and timing risk; in addition, reinsurance contracts must also include a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity. We have entered into certain insurance and reinsurance contracts, primarily in our General Insurance companies, that do not contain sufficient insurance risk to be accounted for as insurance or reinsurance and are therefore subject to deposit accounting.\n",

To determine fair value, we primarily use a discounted expected future cash flow analysis that estimates and discounts projected future distributable earnings. Such analysis is principally based on our business projections that inherently include judgments regarding business trends.\n",
      "Liability for Legal Contingencies\n",
      "We estimate and record a liability for potential losses that may arise from regulatory and government investigations and actions and litigation and other forms of dispute resolution to the extent such losses are probable and can be estimated. Determining a reasonable estimate of the amount of such losses requires significant management judgment. In many cases, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases that are in the early stages of litigation or in which claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, we often cannot predict the outcome or estimate the eventual loss or range of reasonably possible losses related to such matters. Given the inherent unpredictability of such matters, the outcome of certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n",

The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed.\n",

These factors include forecasts of future income for each of our businesses and actual and planned business and operational changes, both of which include assumptions about future macroeconomic and AIG specific conditions and events. We subject the forecasts to stresses of key assumptions and evaluate the effect on tax attribute utilization. We also apply stresses to our assumptions about the effectiveness of relevant prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. We have also considered the impact of the Tax Act on our forecasts of taxable income, made certain assumptions related to interpretation of relevant new rules, and incorporated guidance issued by the U.S. tax authority. Our analysis also reflects the effect of slower utilization of our tax credits due to a reduction in the U.S. statutory tax rate as a result of the Tax Act. Our income forecasts, coupled with our tax planning strategies, all resulted in sufficient taxable income to achieve realization of the U.S. tax attributes prior to their expiration.\n",

      "Our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit and equity market conditions, catastrophic claims events, regulation, tax policy, competition, and general economic, market and political conditions. We continued to operate under difficult market conditions in 2019, characterized by factors such as the impact of historically low interest rates, slowing global economic growth, global trade tensions and the UK’s pending withdrawal from its membership in the European Union (the EU) (commonly referred to as Brexit). Brexit has also affected the U.S. dollar/British pound exchange rate and increased the volatility of exchange rates among the Euro, British pound and the Japanese yen (the Major Currencies), which may continue for some time.\n",
      "Impact of Changes in the Interest Rate Environment\n",
      "While many benchmark U.S. interest rates had risen to recent period highs in 2018, more recent concerns about global trade and potential weakness in U.S. economic expansion led to declining interest rates in 2019, with key benchmark rates in the U.S. and in many developed markets close to historic lows and, in some international jurisdictions, negative. The low interest rate environment negatively affects sales of interest rate sensitive products in our industry and negatively impacts the profitability of our existing business as we reinvest cash flows from investments, including increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolios. On the other hand, if rates rise, some of these impacts may abate while there may be different impacts, some of which are highlighted below. We actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through portfolio selection and asset-liability management, including spread management strategies for our investment-oriented products and economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable and fixed index annuities.\n",

      "Additionally, sustained low interest rates may result in higher pension expense due to the impact on discounting of projected benefit cash flows.\n",
      "Annuity Sales and Surrenders\n",
      "The sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry. Low long-term interest rates put pressure on investment returns, which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products. However, our disciplined rate setting has helped to mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. Rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased sales, but may also drive higher surrenders. Customers are, however, currently buying fixed annuities with surrender charge periods, generally in the three-to-five year range, in pursuit of higher returns, which may help mitigate increased early surrenders in a rising rate environment. In addition, older contracts that have higher minimum interest rates and continue to be attractive to the contract holders have driven better than expected persistency in Fixed Annuities, although the reserves for such contracts have continued to decrease over time in amount and as a percentage of the total annuity portfolio. We will closely monitor surrenders of Fixed Annuities as contracts with lower minimum interest rates come out of the surrender charge period in a more attractive rate environment. Low interest rates have also driven growth in our fixed index annuity products, which provide additional interest crediting, tied to favorable performance in certain equity market indices and the availability of guaranteed living benefits. Changes in interest rates significantly impact the valuation of our liabilities for annuities with guaranteed income features and the value of the related hedging portfolio.\n",
      "Reinvestment and Spread Management\n",
      "We actively monitor fixed income markets, including the level of interest rates, credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve. We also frequently review our interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for new and in-force business. Business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in light of the interest rate environment. A low interest rate environment puts margin pressure on pricing of new business and on existing products, due to the challenge of investing new money or recurring premiums and deposits, and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows, in the low interest rate environment. In addition, there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain in-force business. Specifically, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities.\n",
      "The contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in products may reduce spreads in a sustained low interest rate environment and thus reduce future profitability. Although this interest rate risk is partially mitigated through the asset-liability management process, product design elements and crediting rate strategies, a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability.\n",
      "For additional information on our investment and asset-liability management strategies see Investments.\n",
      "For investment-oriented products in our Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance and Institutional Markets businesses, our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business, modifying or limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads, using asset-liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable, and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. Renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals in accordance with state and federal laws and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. We will continue to adjust crediting rates on in-force business to mitigate the pressure on spreads from declining base yields, but our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by the competitive environment, contractual minimum crediting rates, and provisions that allow rates to be reset only at pre-established intervals. As interest rates rise, we may need to raise crediting rates on in-force business for competitive and other reasons potentially reducing the impact of investing in a higher interest rate environment.\n",
      "Of the aggregate fixed account values of our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement annuity products, 65 percent were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at December 31, 2019. The percentage of fixed account values of our annuity products that are currently crediting at rates above one percent was 61 percent and 66 percent at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These businesses continue to focus on pricing discipline and strategies to manage the minimum guaranteed interest crediting rates offered on new sales in the context of regulatory requirements and competitive positioning. In the core universal life business in our Life Insurance business, 63 percent of the account values were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at December 31, 2019.\n",

      "*Individual Retirement and Group Retirement amounts shown include fixed options within variable annuity products.\n",
      "General Insurance\n",
      "The impact of low interest rates on our General Insurance segment is primarily on our long-tail Casualty line of business. We expect limited impacts on our existing long-tail Casualty business as the duration of our assets is slightly longer than that of our liabilities. Sustained low interest rates would potentially impact new and renewal business for the long-tail Casualty line as we may not be able to adjust our future pricing consistent with our profitability objectives to fully offset the impact of investing at lower rates. However, we will continue to maintain pricing discipline and risk selection.\n",
      "In addition, for our General Insurance segment and General Insurance Run-Off Lines reported within the Legacy Portfolio, sustained low interest rates may unfavorably affect the net loss reserve discount for workers’ compensation, and to a lesser extent could favorably impact assumptions about future medical costs, the combined net effect of which could result in higher net loss reserves.\n",
      "Standard of Care Developments\n",
      "In our Life and Retirement business, we and our distributors are subject to laws and regulations regarding the standard of care applicable to sales of our products and the provision of advice to our customers. In recent years, many of these laws and regulations have been revised or reexamined while others have been newly adopted. We continue to closely follow these legislative and regulatory activities. For additional information regarding these legislative and regulatory activities, see Item 1. Business - Regulation - U.S. Regulation - Standard of Care Developments. Changes in standard of care requirements or new standards issued by governmental authorities, such as the DOL, the SEC, the NAIC or state regulators and/or legislators, may affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. While we cannot predict the long-term impact of these legislative and regulatory developments on our Life and Retirement businesses, we believe our diverse product offerings and distribution relationships position us to compete effectively in this evolving marketplace.\n",

The net effect on underwriting results, however, is significantly mitigated, as both revenues and expenses are similarly affected.\n",

The Ministry of Justice concluded a public call for evidence on January 30, 2019 prior to beginning its first review.

      "U.S. Tax Reform Overview\n",
      "On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted Public Law 115-97, known informally as the Tax Act. The Tax Act reduced the statutory rate of U.S. federal corporate income tax to 21 percent and enacted numerous other changes impacting AIG and the insurance industry. Changes specific to the insurance industry include the calculation of insurance tax reserves and related transition adjustments, amortization of specified policy acquisition expenses, treatment of separate account dividends received deductions and computation of pro-ration adjustments. Provisions of the Tax Act with broader application include reductions or elimination of deductions for certain items, e.g., reductions to corporate dividends received deductions, disallowance of entertainment expenses and limitations on the deduction of certain executive compensation costs. These provisions, generally, result in an increase in AIG’s taxable income.\n",
      "The Tax Act includes provisions for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) under which taxes are imposed on the excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of certain foreign subsidiaries and for Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) under which taxes are imposed on certain base eroding payments to affiliated foreign companies. While the U.S. tax authorities issued formal guidance, including recently issued proposed and final regulations for BEAT and other provisions of the Tax Act, there are still certain aspects of the Tax Act that remain unclear and subject to substantial uncertainties. Additional guidance is expected in future periods. Such guidance may result in changes to the interpretations and assumptions we made and actions we may take, which may impact amounts recorded with respect to international provisions of the Tax Act, possibly materially. Consistent with accounting guidance, we treat BEAT as a period tax charge in the period the tax is incurred and have made an accounting policy election to treat GILTI taxes in a similar manner.\n",
      "Repatriation Assumptions\n",
      "As a result of the Tax Act, the majority of accumulated foreign earnings that were previously untaxed are subject to a one-time deemed repatriation tax. Going forward, foreign earnings not taxed as part of the one-time deemed repatriation (or otherwise taxed currently under the GILTI or subpart F regimes) will generally be exempt from U.S. tax upon repatriation. Notwithstanding the changes, U.S. tax on foreign exchange gain or loss and certain non-U.S. withholding taxes will continue to be applicable upon future repatriations of foreign earnings. For 2019, we consider our foreign earnings with respect to certain operations in Canada, South Africa, the Far East, Latin America, Bermuda as well as the European, Asia Pacific and Middle East regions to be indefinitely reinvested. These earnings relate to ongoing operations and have been reinvested in active business operations. Deferred taxes, if necessary, have been provided on earnings of non-U.S. affiliates whose earnings are not indefinitely reinvested.\n",

      "OUTLOOK-INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC FACTORS\n",
      "Below is a discussion of the industry and economic factors impacting our operating segments:\n",
      "General Insurance - North America\n",
      "Commercial Lines over recent years has experienced challenging market conditions, with widespread excess capacity increasing competition and suppressing rates across multiple classes of business. However, in more recent periods we are seeing growing market support for rate increases in challenged segments where major carriers are reducing their risk appetite and market capacity is contracting as a result. We are seeing rate increases across U.S. Financial Lines and Liability segments (outside of workers’ compensation), with a common driver being higher industry-wide claims severity trends, as well as within our Property and Specialty portfolios. We continue to achieve positive rate increases across a number of lines and classes of business as a result of our disciplined underwriting strategy and focus on risk selection. Further, we continue to achieve growth in several of our Commercial Lines high margin businesses, although these market segments remain highly competitive.\n",
      "Personal Insurance growth prospects are supported by the need for full life cycle products and coverage, increases in personal wealth accumulation, and awareness of insurance protection and risk management. We compete in the high net worth market, accident and health insurance, travel insurance, and warranty services and will continue to expand our innovative products and services to distribution partners and clients.\n",
      "General Insurance - International\n",
      "We believe our global presence provides Commercial Lines and Personal Insurance a distinct competitive advantage, as the demand for multinational cross-border coverage and services increases due to the growing number of international customers, while giving us the ability to respond quickly to local market conditions and build client relationships.\n",
      "The Commercial Lines market continues to be highly competitive, due to increased market capacity and ample availability of capital. Despite this, we continue to grow our most profitable segments and diversify our portfolio across all regions by expanding into new product lines (e.g., cyber), new client segments (e.g., middle market) and new distribution channels (e.g., digital and national brokers) while remaining a market leader in key developed and developing markets. Overall, Commercial lines are showing positive rate increases in selective products and markets where market events or withdrawal of capability have favorably impacted pricing. We are maintaining our underwriting discipline, reducing gross and net limits, increasing use of reinsurance to reduce volatility, as well as continuing our risk selection strategy to improve profitability.\n",
      "Personal Insurance focuses on individual customers, as well as group and corporate clients. Although market competition within Personal Insurance has increased, we continue to benefit from the underwriting quality, portfolio diversity, and generally low volatility of the short-tailed risk in these business lines, although some product classes are exposed to catastrophe losses.\n",

      "a sustained low interest rate environment, which makes it difficult to profitably price new products and puts margin pressure on existing business due to lower reinvestment yields;\n",

      "OUTLOOK-INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC FACTORS\n",
      "Below is a discussion of the industry and economic factors impacting our specific operating segments:\n",
      "Individual Retirement\n",
      "Increasing life expectancy and reduced expectations for traditional retirement income from defined benefit programs and fixed income securities are leading Americans to seek additional financial security as they approach retirement. The strong demand for individual index and fixed deferred annuities with guaranteed income features has attracted increased competition in this product space. In response to the continued low interest rate environment, which has added pressure to profit margins, we have developed guaranteed income benefits for variable, fixed index, and fixed deferred annuities with margins that are less sensitive to the level of interest rates.\n",
      "Changes in the interest rate environment can have a significant impact on sales, surrender rates, investment returns, guaranteed income features, and spreads in the annuity industry.\n",
      "Group Retirement\n",
      "Group Retirement competes in the defined contribution market under the AIG Retirement Services brand. AIG Retirement Services is a leading retirement plan provider in the U.S. for K-12 schools and school districts, higher education, healthcare, government and other not-for-profit institutions. The defined contribution market is a highly efficient and competitive market that requires support for both plan sponsors and individual participants. To meet this challenge, AIG Retirement Services is investing in a client-focused technology platform to support improved compliance and self-service functionality. AIG Retirement Services’ model pairs self-service tools with its career financial advisors who provide individual plan participants with enrollment support and comprehensive financial planning services.\n",
      "Changes in the interest rate environment can have a significant impact on investment returns, guaranteed income features, and spreads, and a moderate impact on sales and surrender rates.\n",
      "88 AIG | 2019 Form 10-K\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Business Segment Operations | Life and Retirement\n",
      "Life Insurance\n",
      "Consumers have a significant need for life insurance, whether it is used for income replacement for their surviving family, estate planning or wealth transfer. Additionally, consumers use life insurance to provide living benefits in case of chronic, critical or terminal illnesses, and to supplement retirement income.\n",
      "In response to consumer needs and a sustained low interest rate environment, our Life Insurance product portfolio will continue to promote products with lower long-duration interest rate risk and mitigate exposure to products that have long-duration interest rate risk through sales levels and hedging strategies.\n",
      "As life insurance ownership remains at historical lows in the U.S. and the UK, efforts to expand the reach and increase the affordability of life insurance are critical. The industry is investing in consumer-centric efforts to reduce traditional barriers to securing life protection by simplifying the sales and service experience. Digitally enabled processes and tools provide a fast, friendly and simple path to life insurance protection.\n",

Interest rates declined in 2019 and are near historical lows. Excluding prior year deposits from FHLB funding agreements, premiums and deposits increased in 2019 compared to the prior year. Net flows in 2019 remained negative but improved compared to the prior year primarily due to higher deposits driven by increased Fixed and Index Annuities sales, offset by lower sales for the Variable Annuities and Retail Mutual Funds. Premiums and deposits improved in 2018 compared to 2017. Premiums and deposits in 2018 included deposits from FHLB funding agreements. Net flows in 2018 deteriorated compared to 2017 and continued to be negative primarily due to higher surrenders and withdrawals, mainly in Retail Mutual Funds.\n",

Partially offsetting these increases were lower Variable Annuity policy and advisory fee income, net of expenses due to Variable Annuity and Retail Mutual Fund negative net flows. Adjusted pre-tax income decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 as a result of decreased Fixed Annuity base spread income primarily due to lower reinvestment yields and decreased gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected, and higher Variable Annuity DAC amortization and reserves due to lower equity market performance.

Those reinsurance transactions were designed to consolidate most of our Legacy Insurance Run-Off Lines into a single legal entity. As of December 31, 2019, the affiliated transactions included the cession of approximately $30.2 billion of reserves from our Legacy Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines and approximately $3.9 billion of reserves from our Legacy General Insurance Run-Off Lines related to business written by multiple wholly-owned AIG subsidiaries. Fortitude Re has approximately $2.5 billion of total assets after elimination of intercompany balances, primarily managed by AIG, and is AIG’s main run-off reinsurer with its own dedicated management team. In the second quarter of 2018, we formed Fortitude Holdings to act as a holding company for Fortitude Re.\n",

Upon completion of the 2018 Fortitude Sale, Fortitude Holdings owned 100 percent of the outstanding common shares of Fortitude Re and AIG had an 80.1 percent ownership interest in Fortitude Holdings. AIG received $381 million in cash and will receive up to $95 million of deferred compensation which is subject to certain purchase price adjustments. To the extent AIG does not receive all or a portion of the planned distributions within 18 months of the 2018 Fortitude Sale, TCG will pay us up to an additional $100 million. In connection with the 2018 Fortitude Sale, we agreed to certain investment commitment targets into various Carlyle strategies and to certain minimum investment management fee payments within thirty-six months following the closing. AIG also will be required to pay a proportionate amount of an agreed make-whole fee to the extent we fail to satisfy such investment commitment targets.\n",

      "Investments\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "Our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit by targeting an asset allocation mix that provides diversification from an asset class, sector, issuer, and geographic perspective. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus. The majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of fixed maturity securities.\n",
      "Investment Strategies\n",
      "Investment strategies are assessed at the business segment level and involve considerations that include local and general market conditions, duration and cash flow management, risk appetite and volatility constraints, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, tax and legal investment limitations.\n",
      "Some of our key investment strategies are as follows:\n",
      "Our fundamental strategy across the portfolios is to seek investments with similar characteristics to the associated insurance liabilities to the extent practicable. AIG embeds Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations in its fundamental investment analysis of the companies or projects we invest in to ensure that they have sustainable earnings over the full term of our investment. AIG considers internal and external factors and evaluates changes in consumer behavior, industry trends related to ESG factors as well as the ability of the management of companies to respond appropriately to these changes in order to maintain their competitive advantage.\n",
      "We seek to originate investments that offer enhanced yield through liquidity premiums, such as private placements and commercial mortgage loans, which also add portfolio diversification. These assets typically afford credit protections through covenants, ability to customize structures that meet our insurance liability needs, and deeper due diligence given information access.\n",
      "Given our global presence, we have access to assets that provide diversification from local markets. To the extent we purchase these investments, we generally hedge the currency risk using derivatives, which could provide opportunities to earn higher risk adjusted returns compared to risk assets in the functional currency.\n",
      "AIG Parent, included in Other Operations, actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchases publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity.\n",
      "Within the U.S., the Life and Retirement and General Insurance investments are generally split between reserve backing and surplus portfolios.\n",
      "AIG | 2019 Form 10-K 109\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Investments\n",
      "-Insurance reserves are backed by mainly investment grade fixed maturity securities that meet our current risk-return, tax, liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectives. We assess fixed maturity asset classes based on their fundamental risk, including credit (public and private), commercial mortgages and residential mortgages regardless of whether such investments are bonds, loans, or structured products.\n",
      "-Surplus accounts seek to enhance portfolio returns through a mix of fixed maturity (investment grade and high yield) and various alternative asset classes, including private equity, real estate equity, and hedge funds. Over the past few years, hedge fund investments have been reduced with more emphasis given to private equity, real estate and leveraged capital (for example, we are currently focused on purchasing directly originated, middle market loans with strong covenant packages).\n",
      "Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by insurance companies consist primarily of high-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.\n",
      "Asset Liability Management\n",
      "The investment strategy within the General Insurance companies focuses on growth of surplus, maintenance of sufficient liquidity for unanticipated insurance claims, and preservation of capital. Assets with varying degrees of liquidity and volatility are allocated based on whether backing reserves, required surplus or excess surplus, subject to capital, liquidity, and regulatory constraints. General Insurance invests primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans. Fixed maturity securities of the General Insurance companies’ domestic operations have an average duration of 3.5 years. Fixed maturity securities of the General Insurance companies’ foreign operations have an average duration of 3.6 years.\n",
      "While invested assets backing reserves of the General Insurance companies are primarily invested in conventional liquid fixed maturity securities, we have continued to allocate to asset classes that offer higher yields through structural and liquidity premiums, particularly in the domestic operations. In addition, we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset-backed investments to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates and inflation. We seek to diversify the portfolio across asset classes, sectors, and issuers to mitigate idiosyncratic portfolio risks.\n",
      "In addition, a portion of the surplus of General Insurance is invested in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments which seek to balance liquidity, volatility and growth. There is a higher allocation to equity-oriented investments in General Insurance relative to other AIG portfolios given the underlying inflation risks inherent in that business. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio.\n",
      "The investment strategy of the Life and Retirement companies is to provide net investment income to back liabilities that result in stable distributable earnings and enhance portfolio value for surplus accounts, subject to asset liability management, capital, and regulatory constraints.\n",
      "The Life and Retirement companies use asset-liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses. The Life and Retirement companies maintain a diversified, high to medium quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans that, to the extent practicable, match the duration characteristics of the liabilities. The investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities, and as a result, duration varies between distinct portfolios. The interest rate environment has a direct impact on the asset liability management profile of the businesses, and an extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses, which may require us to further extend the duration of the investment portfolio. A further lengthening of the portfolio will be assessed in the context of available market opportunities as longer duration markets may not provide similar diversification benefits as shorter duration markets.\n",
      "Fixed maturity securities of the Life and Retirement companies’ domestic operations have an average duration of 8.0 years. We seek to diversify the portfolio across asset class, sectors, and issuers to mitigate idiosyncratic portfolio risks.\n",
      "In addition, the Life and Retirement companies seek to enhance surplus portfolio returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields.\n",
      "NAIC Designations of Fixed Maturity Securities\n",
      "The Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) evaluates the investments of U.S. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called ‘NAIC Designations.’ In general, NAIC Designations of ‘1’ highest quality, or ‘2’ high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade,\n",
      "110 AIG | 2019 Form 10-K\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Investments\n",
      "while NAIC Designations of ‘3’ through ‘6’ generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade. The NAIC has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities, including non-agency RMBS and CMBS, which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses to better determine the appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities. These methodologies result in an improved NAIC Designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. The following tables summarize the ratings distribution of AIG subsidiaries fixed maturity security portfolio by NAIC Designation, and the distribution by composite AIG credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies.\n",

      "Credit Ratings\n",
      "At December 31, 2019, approximately 89 percent of our fixed maturity securities were held by our domestic entities. Approximately 16 percent of these securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies, and approximately 13 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated. Our investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services’ ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis.\n",
      "Moody’s Investors Service Inc. (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&P Global Inc. (S&P), or similar foreign rating services rate a significant portion of our foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio. Rating services are not available for some foreign-issued securities. Our Credit Risk Management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio’s non-rated fixed maturity securities. At December 31, 2019, approximately 24 percent of such investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of our internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated AAA, and approximately 6 percent were below investment grade or not rated. Approximately 29 percent of the foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio is comprised of sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance.\n",

      "In the first quarter of 2017, we entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO, under which we transferred to NICO 80 percent of the reserve risk on substantially all of our U.S. Commercial long-tail exposures for accident years 2015 and prior. Under this agreement, we ceded to NICO 80 percent of the losses on subject business paid on or after January 1, 2016 in excess of $25 billion of net paid losses, up to an aggregate limit of $25 billion. We account for this transaction as retroactive reinsurance. This transaction resulted in a gain, which under U.S. GAAP retroactive reinsurance accounting is deferred and amortized into income over the settlement period. NICO created a collateral trust account as security for their claim payment obligations to us, into which they deposited the consideration paid under the agreement, and Berkshire has provided a parental guarantee to secure NICO’s obligations under the agreement.\n",

Estimated gross profit projections include assumptions for investment-related returns and spreads, product-related fees and expenses, mortality gains and losses, policyholder behavior and other factors. In estimating future gross profits, lapse and other assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on DAC amortization. If the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC and related reserves are recalculated using the updated assumptions, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. Updating such assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.\n",

The fair value of these embedded derivatives is based on actuarial assumptions, including policyholder behavior, as well as capital market assumptions.\n",

      "•We increased our reversion to the mean rates of return (gross of fees) to 3.62 percent from 2.92 percent for the Variable Annuity product line in Individual Retirement and to 3.29 percent from 1.90 percent for the Variable Annuity product line in Group Retirement primarily due to the recent strong returns in equity markets. Our separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption related to equity market performance remained unchanged at 7.0 percent; and\n",
      "•Our ultimate projected yields on invested assets changed on most annuity deposits with some increased by up to 9 basis points and others decreased by up to 34 basis points and lowered by up to 40 basis points on some life insurance deposits. Projected yields are graded from a weighted average net GAAP book yield of existing assets supporting the business based on the value of the assets to a weighted average yield based on the duration of the assets excluding assets that mature during the grading period. The grading period is three years for deferred annuity products and five years for life insurance products due to deferred annuities having a shorter duration than life products.\n",

      "For long-duration traditional products discussed below, which include whole life insurance, term life insurance, accident and health insurance, long-term care insurance, and life-contingent single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements, a “lock-in” principle applies. The assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs.

      "•The economic hedge target uses best estimate actuarial assumptions and excludes explicit risk margins used for U.S. GAAP valuation, such as margins for policyholder behavior, mortality, and volatility; and\n",
      "•The economic hedge target excludes the non-performance or “own credit” risk adjustment used in the U.S. GAAP valuation, which reflects a market participant’s view of our claims-paying ability by incorporating an additional spread (the NPA spread) to the swap curve used to discount projected benefit cash flows.\n",
      "128 AIG | 2019 Form 10-K\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Insurance Reserves\n",

The primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include:\n",

      "Changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative contracts, which included swaps, swaptions and futures, resulted in gains driven by lower interest rates in 2019 compared to losses in the prior year, which was driven by higher interest rates. The small net loss in 2017 reflected increases in rates in the latter half of 2017, partially offset by the impact of interest rate declines in the first half of 2017.\n",
      "The change in the fair value of equity derivative contracts, which included futures and options, reflected losses in 2019, gains in 2018 and losses in 2017, which varied based on the relative change in equity market returns in the respective periods.\n",

      "The net adjustments to DAC amortization from the update of actuarial assumptions for estimated gross profits, including those reported within change in DAC related to net realized capital gains (losses), represented two percent, four percent and two percent of the DAC balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n",
      "Reversion to the Mean\n",
      "The reversion to the mean rate is updated quarterly based on market returns and can change dramatically in periods where market returns move significantly. The five-year reversion to the mean period did not meet the criteria for adjustment in 2019 which would have otherwise required a reset of the start date used in the calculation of the average gross long-term return rate. The long-term growth assumption used in our reversion to the mean methodology remained unchanged at 7.0 percent in 2019 and 2018.\n",
      "In 2017, we updated the long-term annual growth assumption applied to subsequent periods used in our reversion to the mean methodology for estimating future estimated gross profits for variable annuity products, from 7.5 percent to 7.0 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected). The five-year reversion to the mean period met the criteria for adjustment in 2017. As a result, the average gross long-term return measurement start date was reset to December 31, 2011 for Individual Retirement and June 30, 2013 for Group Retirement; the reversion to the mean rates (gross of fees) were increased to 3.74 percent in Individual Retirement and 3.78 percent in Group Retirement. Sustained favorable equity market performance in excess of long-term assumptions could result in additional unlocking in the Individual Retirement or Group Retirement variable annuity product lines in the future, with a positive effect on pre-tax income in the period of the unlocking.\n",

      "DAC and Reserves Related to Unrealized Appreciation of Investments\n",
      "DAC and Reserves for universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) are adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the change in DAC, unearned revenue, and benefit reserves with an offset to Other comprehensive income (OCI) as if securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (shadow Investment-Oriented Adjustments). Similarly, for long-duration traditional products, significant unrealized appreciation of investments in a sustained low interest rate environment may cause additional future policy benefit liabilities (shadow Loss Adjustments) with an offset to OCI to be recorded.\n",
      "Shadow adjustments to DAC and unearned revenue generally move in the opposite direction of the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, reducing the reported DAC and unearned revenue balance when market interest rates decline. Conversely, shadow adjustments to benefit reserves generally move in the same direction as the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, increasing reported future policy benefit liabilities balance when market interest rates decline.\n",
      "Market interest rates decreased in 2019, which drove a $12.6 billion increase in the unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity securities held to support businesses in the Life and Retirement companies at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, the shadow Investment-Oriented Adjustments reflected decreases in DAC and unearned revenues and an increase in future policy benefit liabilities compared to December 31, 2018, while the shadow Loss Adjustments reflected an increase in future policy benefit liabilities.\n",

      "Liquidity and Capital Resources\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "Liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet our payment obligations. It is defined as cash and unencumbered assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost. We endeavor to manage our liquidity prudently through various risk committees, policies and procedures, and a stress testing and liquidity risk framework established by our Treasury group with oversight by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Our liquidity risk framework is designed to manage liquidity at both AIG Parent and its subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six months under a liquidity stress scenario.\n",
      "See Enterprise Risk Management - Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement and Enterprise Risk Management - Liquidity Risk Management below for additional information.\n",
      "Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. Our primary source of ongoing capital generation is derived from the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. We must comply with numerous constraints on our minimum capital positions. These constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy at AIG and the individual businesses and are based on internally-defined risk tolerances, regulatory requirements, rating agency and creditor expectations and business needs. Actual capital levels are monitored on a regular basis, and using ERM’s stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital impact of potential macroeconomic, financial and insurance stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraints of both AIG and our insurance subsidiaries.\n",
      "We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events.\n",
      "Nevertheless, some circumstances may cause our cash or capital needs to exceed projected liquidity or readily deployable capital resources. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash or capital needs and loss of sources of liquidity and capital. In addition, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.\n",
      "Depending on market conditions, regulatory and rating agency considerations and other factors, we may take various liability and capital management actions. Liability management actions may include, but are not limited to, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers. Capital management actions may include, but are not limited to, issuing preferred stock, paying dividends to our shareholders and AIG Common Stock and/or warrant repurchases.\n",

      "AIG Parent\n",
      "As of December 31, 2019, AIG Parent had approximately $12.1 billion in liquidity sources. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities and also include a committed, revolving syndicated credit facility. Fixed maturity securities primarily include U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. Based upon an assessment of funding needs, the liquidity sources can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements or contributed as admitted assets to regulated insurance companies. AIG Parent liquidity is monitored through the use of various internal liquidity risk measures. AIG Parent’s primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from subsidiaries and credit facilities. AIG Parent’s primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, and operating expenses.\n",
      "We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy our reasonably foreseeable future requirements and meet our obligations to our creditors, debt-holders and insurance company subsidiaries. We expect to access the debt and preferred equity markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed.\n",
      "We utilize our capital resources to support our businesses, with the majority of capital allocated to our insurance operations. Should we have or generate more capital than is needed to support our business strategies (including organic growth or acquisition opportunities) or mitigate risks inherent to our business, we may develop plans to distribute such capital to shareholders via dividends or AIG Common Stock repurchase authorizations or deploy such capital towards liability management.\n",
      "In the normal course, it is expected that a portion of the capital released by our insurance operations, by our other operations or through the utilization of AIG’s deferred tax assets may be available to support our business strategies, for distribution to shareholders or for liability management.\n",
      "AIG | 2019 Form 10-K 137\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Liquidity and Capital Resources\n",
      "In developing plans to distribute capital, AIG considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to: AIG’s business and strategic plans, expectations for capital generation and utilization, AIG’s funding capacity and capital resources in comparison to internal benchmarks, as well as rating agency expectations, regulatory standards and internal stress tests for capital.\n",
      "The following table presents AIG Parent's liquidity sources:\n",
      "(a)Cash and short-term investments include reverse repurchase agreements totaling $2.1 billion and $22 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n",
      "(b)Unencumbered securities consist of publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.

      "Insurance Companies\n",
      "We expect that our insurance companies will be able to continue to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. Our insurance companies’ liquidity resources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.\n",
      "Each of our material insurance companies’ liquidity is monitored through various internal liquidity risk measures. The primary sources of liquidity are premiums, fees, reinsurance recoverables and investment income and maturities. The primary uses of liquidity are paid losses, reinsurance payments, benefit claims, surrenders, withdrawals, interest payments, dividends, expenses, investment purchases and collateral requirements.\n",
      "Our General Insurance companies may require additional funding to meet capital or liquidity needs under certain circumstances. Large catastrophes may require us to provide additional support to our affected operations. Downgrades in our credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, which could result in non-renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect a subsidiary’s ability to meet its own obligations. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital. Other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include an economic collapse of a nation or region significant to our operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval.\n",
      "Management believes that because of the size and liquidity of our Life and Retirement companies’ investment portfolios, normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience would not create significant liquidity risk. Furthermore, our Life and Retirement companies’ products contain certain features that mitigate surrender risk, including surrender charges. However, in times of extreme capital markets disruption, liquidity needs could outpace resources. As part of their risk management framework, our Life and Retirement companies continue to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue strategies and programs to improve their liquidity position and facilitate their ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio.\n",
      "Certain of our U.S. insurance companies are members of the FHLBs in their respective districts. Borrowings from FHLBs are used to supplement liquidity or for other uses deemed appropriate by management. Our U.S. General Insurance companies had no outstanding borrowings from FHLBs at December 31, 2019 and aggregate outstanding borrowings of approximately $115 million at December 31, 2018. Our U.S. Life and Retirement companies had $3.5 billion and $3.4 billion which were due to FHLBs in their respective districts at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, under funding agreements issued through our Individual Retirement, Group Retirement and Institutional Markets operating segments, which were reported in Policyholder contract deposits. In addition, our U.S. Life and Retirement companies had no outstanding borrowings in the form of cash advances from FHLBs at both December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Liquidity and Capital Resources\n",
      "Certain of our U.S. Life and Retirement companies have programs, which began in 2012, that lend securities from their investment portfolio to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management. Under these programs, these U.S. Life and Retirement companies lend securities to financial institutions and receive cash as collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. Cash collateral received is invested in short-term investments or partially used for short-term liquidity purposes. Additionally, the aggregate amount of securities that a Life and Retirement company is able to lend under its program at any time is limited to five percent of its general account statutory-basis admitted assets. Our U.S. Life and Retirement companies had $2.8 billion and $884 million of securities subject to these agreements at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $2.9 billion and $904 million of liabilities to borrowers for collateral received at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n",
      "AIG generally manages capital between AIG Parent and our insurance companies through internal, Board-approved policies and limits, as well as management standards. In addition, AIG Parent has unconditional capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) in place with certain subsidiaries. Nevertheless, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer capital freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.\n",
      "In February 2018, AIG Parent entered into a CMA with Fortitude Re. Among other things, the CMA provides that AIG Parent will maintain available statutory capital and surplus in each of Fortitude Re’s long term business fund and general business account at or above a stress threshold percentage of its projected enhanced capital requirement in respect of the applicable fund, as defined under Bermuda law. As of December 31, 2019, the stress threshold percentage under this CMA was 125 percent.\n",
      "AIG Parent and/or certain subsidiaries are parties to several letter of credit agreements with various financial institutions, which issue letters of credit from time to time in support of our insurance companies. These letters of credit are subject to reimbursement by AIG Parent and/or certain subsidiaries in the event of a drawdown by our insurance companies. Letters of credit issued in support of the General Insurance companies totaled approximately $3.9 billion at December 31, 2019. Letters of credit issued in support of the Life and Retirement companies totaled approximately $859 million at December 31, 2019. Letters of credit issued in support of Fortitude Re totaled $550 million at December 31, 2019.\n",
      "In 2019, our General Insurance companies collectively paid a total of approximately $2.2 billion in dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities to AIG Parent. The fixed maturity securities primarily included U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities.\n",
      "In 2019, our Life and Retirement companies collectively paid a total of approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and loan repayments in the form of cash to AIG Parent.\n",
      "Tax Matters\n",
      "If the settlement agreements in principle are concluded in our ongoing dispute related to the disallowance of foreign tax credits associated with cross border financing transactions, we will be required to make a payment to the U.S. Treasury. Although we can provide no assurance regarding whether the non-binding settlements will be finalized, the amount we currently expect to pay based on current proposed settlement terms is approximately $1.7 billion, including obligations of AIG Parent and subsidiaries. This amount is net of payments previously made with respect to cross border financing transactions involving matters dating back to 1997 and other matters largely related to the same tax years. There remains uncertainty with regard to whether the settlements in principle will ultimately be approved by the relevant authorities as well as the amount and timing of any potential payment(s) or prepayment(s), one or more of which could be made as early as the first quarter of 2020.\n",
      "For additional information regarding this matter see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "Credit Facilities\n",
      "We maintain a committed, revolving syndicated credit facility (the Facility) as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. The Facility provides for aggregate commitments by the bank syndicate to provide unsecured revolving loans and/or standby letters of credit of up to $4.5 billion without any limits on the type of borrowings and is scheduled to expire in June 2022.\n",
      "As of December 31, 2019, a total of $4.5 billion remains available under the Facility. Our ability to utilize the Facility is not contingent on our credit ratings. However, our ability to utilize the Facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the Facility. These include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the Facility would restrict our access to the Facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We expect to utilize the Facility from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.\n",

      "(a)Represents loss reserves, undiscounted and gross of reinsurance.\n",
      "(b)The company also procured additional office space via operating lease contracts for which lease commencement will occur in 2020. Future undiscounted obligations stemming from those contracts total $507 million, which excludes the effect of renewal options.\n",

      "(d)Does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $4.8 billion. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n",
      "Loss Reserves\n",
      "Loss reserves relate to our General Insurance companies and represent estimates of future loss and loss adjustment expense payments based on historical loss development payment patterns. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the payments by period presented above could be materially different from actual required payments. We believe that our General Insurance companies maintain adequate financial resources to meet the actual required payments under these obligations.\n",
      "Insurance and Investment Contract Liabilities\n",
      "Insurance and investment contract liabilities, including GIC liabilities, relate to our Life and Retirement companies. These liabilities include various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments. These liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. For these policies and contracts (i) we are not currently making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event beyond our control.\n",
      "We have made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits. These assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force policies. Due to the significance of the assumptions, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. The amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n",

      "We believe that our Life and Retirement companies have adequate financial resources to meet the payments actually required under these obligations. These subsidiaries have substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments. In addition, our Life and Retirement companies maintain significant levels of investment grade rated fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds, and could seek to monetize those holdings in the event operating cash flows are insufficient. We expect liquidity needs related to GIC liabilities to be funded through cash flows generated from maturities and sales of invested assets.\n",
      "Borrowings\n",
      "Our borrowings exclude those incurred by consolidated investments and include hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value. We expect to repay the long-term debt maturities and interest accrued on borrowings by AIG through maturing investments and dispositions of invested assets, future cash flows from operations, cash flows generated from invested assets, future debt or preferred stock issuance and other financing arrangements. Borrowings supported by assets of AIG include various notes and bonds payable as well as GIAs that are supported by cash and investments held by AIG Parent and certain non-insurance subsidiaries for the repayment of those obligations.\n",

The commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. The expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. Investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate subsidiaries.\n",

      "(d)Primarily represents liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations.\n",

      "Indemnification Agreements\n",
      "We are subject to financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements in connection with our sales of businesses. These arrangements may be triggered by declines in asset values, specified business contingencies, the realization of contingent liabilities, litigation developments, or breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by us. These arrangements are typically subject to time limitations, defined by contract or by operation of law, such as by prevailing statutes of limitation. Depending on the specific terms of the arrangements, the maximum potential obligation may or may not be subject to contractual limitations.\n",
      "For additional information regarding our indemnification agreements see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "We have recorded liabilities for certain of these arrangements where it is possible to estimate them. These liabilities are not material in the aggregate.

      "Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "Risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns. We consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance.\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "We have an integrated process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm-wide risk appetite. Our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of AIG’s major risk positions. Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM. ERM supports our businesses and management by embedding risk management in our key day-to-day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, monitoring, reporting, and mitigating the risks taken by our businesses and AIG overall. Nevertheless, our risk management efforts may not always be successful and material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or financial condition may occur.\n",
      "AIG employs a Three Lines of Defense model. AIG’s business leaders assume full accountability for the risks and controls in their operating units, and ERM performs a review, challenge and oversight function. The third line consists of our Internal Audit Group that provides independent assurance for AIG’s Board.\n",
      "Risk Governance Structure\n",
      "Our risk governance structure fosters the development and maintenance of a risk and control management culture that encompasses all significant risk categories impacting our lines of business and functions. Accountability for the implementation of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit. We review our governance and committee structure on a regular basis and make changes as appropriate to continue to effectively manage and govern both our risks and risk-taking activities.\n",
      "Our Board of Directors oversees the management of risk through its Risk and Capital Committee (RCC) and Audit Committee. These committees regularly interact with other committees of the Board of Directors which are further described below. Our Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reports to both the RCC and our Chief Executive Officer.\n",
      "The Group Risk Committee (GRC): The GRC is the senior management group responsible for assessing all significant risk issues on a global basis to protect our financial strength and reputation. The GRC is chaired by our CRO and includes members of the Executive Leadership Team (ELT). Our CRO reports periodically on behalf of the GRC to both the RCC and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Our CRO is also a member of the ELT providing ERM the opportunity to contribute to, review, monitor and consider the impact of changes in strategy.\n",
      "Management committees that support the GRC are described below. These committees are comprised of senior executives and experienced business representatives from a range of functions and business units throughout AIG and its subsidiaries. These committees are charged with identifying, analyzing and reviewing specific risk matters within their respective mandates. In addition, various working groups (e.g. reputational risk, control agenda) are in place in support of the GRC to manage and monitor the various risks across the organization.\n",
      "Financial Risk Group (FRG): The FRG is responsible for the oversight of financial risks taken by AIG and our subsidiaries. Its mandate includes overseeing our aggregate credit, market, interest rate, capital, liquidity and model risks, as well as asset-liability management, derivatives activity, and foreign exchange transactions. It provides the primary corporate-level review function for all proposed transactions and business practices that are significant in size, complex in scope, or that present heightened legal, reputational, accounting or regulatory risks. The FRG is chaired by our CRO. Membership of the FRG also includes our CFO, Chief Investment Officer and Treasurer.\n",

      "Business Unit Risk Committees: Each of our major insurance businesses has established a risk committee that serves as the senior management committee responsible for risk oversight at the individual business unit level. The risk committees are responsible for the identification, assessment and monitoring of all sources of risk within their respective portfolios. Specific responsibilities include setting risk tolerances, reviewing the capital allocation framework, insurance portfolio optimization, and providing oversight of risk-adjusted metrics. In performing these responsibilities, the business unit risk committees may leverage input provided by other business unit committees and working groups.\n",

We balance these by seeking to take measured risks that are expected to generate repeatable, sustainable earnings and create long-term value for our shareholders. The framework includes our risk appetite statement approved by the Board of Directors and a set of supporting tools, including risk tolerances, risk limits and policies, which we use to manage our risk profile and financial resources.\n",
      "We articulate our aggregate risk-taking by setting risk tolerances and thresholds on capital and liquidity measures. These measures are set at the AIG Parent level as well as the legal entity level and cover consolidated and insurance company capital and liquidity ratios. We must comply with standards for capital adequacy and maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all our obligations as they come due in accordance with our capital management and liquidity policies. Our risk tolerances take into consideration regulatory requirements, rating agency expectations, and business needs. The GRC routinely reviews the level of risk taken by the consolidated organization in relation to the established risk tolerances. A consolidated risk report is also presented periodically to the RCC by our CRO.\n",

      "Risk Limits\n",
      "A key component of our Risk Appetite Framework is having a process in place that establishes and maintains appropriate limits on the material risks identified for our core businesses and facilitates the monitoring and meeting of both internal and external stakeholder expectations. Our objectives include:\n",
      "Establishing risk monitoring, providing early warning indicators, and ensuring timely oversight and enforceability of limits;\n",
      "Defining a consistent and transparent approach to limits governance; and\n",
      "Aligning our business activities with our risk appetite statement.\n",
      "To support the monitoring and management of AIG’s and its business units’ material risks, ERM has an established limits framework that employs a three-tiered hierarchy:\n",
      "Board-level risk tolerances are AIG’s aggregate consolidated capital and parent liquidity limits. They define the minimum level of capital and liquidity that we should maintain. These board-level risk tolerances require RCC and Board approval.\n",
      "AIG management level limits are risk type specific limits at the AIG consolidated level. These limits are defined and calibrated to constrain our concentration in specific risk types, to protect against taking risks that exceed the amount of overall capital AIG has available, and to protect against excess earnings volatility. These limits are approved by our CRO with consultation from the GRC.\n",
      "Business unit and legal entity level limits are set to address key risks identified for the business unit and legal entities, protect capital and liquidity at legal entities and/or meet legal entity specific requirements of regulators and rating agencies. These limits are defined by the business unit and legal entity Risk Officers.\n",
      "All limits are reviewed by the GRC or relevant business unit risk committees on a periodic basis and revisions, if applicable, are approved by those committees.\n",
      "The business units are responsible for measuring and monitoring their risk exposures. ERM is responsible for monitoring compliance with limits and providing regular, timely reporting to our senior management and risk committees. Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner and are documented and escalated in accordance with their level of severity or materiality.\n",
      "Risk Identification and Measurement\n",
      "We conduct risk identification through a number of processes at the business unit and corporate level focused on capturing our material risks. A key initiative is our integrated bottom-up risk identification and assessment process which is conducted down to the product-line level. In addition, we perform an annual top-down risk assessment to identify top risks and assign owners to ensure these risks are appropriately addressed and managed. These processes are used as a critical input to enhance and develop our analytics for measuring and assessing risks across the organization.\n",
      "We employ various approaches to measure and monitor risk exposures, including the utilization of a variety of metrics and early warning indicators. We use a proprietary internal capital and stress testing framework to measure our quantifiable risks for both insurance and non-insurance operations.\n",
      "The internal capital framework quantifies our aggregate economic risk at a given confidence interval, after taking into account diversification benefits between risk factors and business lines. We leverage the internal capital framework to help inform our consolidated risk consumption and profile as well as risk and capital allocation for our businesses.\n",
      "The stress testing framework assesses our aggregate exposure to our most significant financial and insurance risks, including the risks in each of our key insurance company subsidiaries in relation to its capital needs under stress, risks inherent in our non-insurance company subsidiaries, and risks to AIG consolidated capital. The framework measures risk over multiple time horizons and under different levels of stress, and includes multi-factor stresses as well as single factor sensitivities that are designed to reflect AIG’s risk characteristics. We use this information to support the assessment of resources needed at the AIG Parent level to support our subsidiaries and capital resources required to maintain consolidated company target capitalization levels.\n",

      "We devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures. These exposures may arise from, but are not limited to, fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance and retrocessional insurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees, letters of credit, and certain General Insurance businesses.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Our credit risks are managed by teams of credit professionals, subject to ERM oversight and various control processes. Their primary role is to ensure appropriate credit risk management in accordance with our credit policies and procedures relative to our credit risk parameters. Our Chief Credit Officer (CCO) and credit executives are primarily responsible for the development, implementation and maintenance of a risk management framework, which includes the following elements related to our credit risks:\n",
      "developing and implementing our company-wide credit policies and procedures;\n",
      "approving delegated credit authorities to our credit executives and qualified credit professionals;\n",

      "approving appropriate credit reserves, credit-related other-than-temporary impairments and corresponding methodologies for all credit portfolios.\n",
      "We monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require mitigants, such as third-party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, including commercial bank-issued letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. We treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, and letters of credit as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data. We also closely monitor the quality of any trust collateral accounts.\n",

      "We are engaged in a variety of insurance, investment and other financial services businesses that expose us to market risk, directly and indirectly. We are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities, on both the asset and the liability sides of our balance sheet through on- and off-balance sheet exposures. Within each business, the Risk Officer is responsible for creating a framework for proper identification of market risks, and ensuring that the risks are appropriately measured, monitored and managed, and are in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the Chief Market Risk Officer (CMRO).\n",
      "The scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner consistent with our risk appetite statement. Our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in the above mentioned market risk drivers.\n",
      "Many of our market risk exposures, including exposures to changes in levels of interest rates and equity prices, are associated with the asset and liability exposures of our Life and Retirement companies. These exposures are generally long-term in nature. Examples of liability-related exposures include interest rate sensitive surrenders in our fixed deferred annuity product portfolio. Also, we have equity market risk sensitive surrenders in our variable annuity product portfolio. These interactive asset-liability types of risk exposures are regularly monitored in accordance with the risk governance framework noted above.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Market risk is overseen at the corporate level within ERM through the CMRO. The CMRO is supported by a dedicated team of professionals within ERM. Market Risk is managed by our finance, treasury and investment management corporate functions, collectively, and in partnership with ERM. The CMRO is primarily responsible for the development and maintenance of a risk management framework that includes the following key components:\n",

      "Risk Identification\n",
      "Market risk focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in broad, external, predominantly market-observable variables. Financial repercussions can include an adverse impact on results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital of AIG.\n",
      "Each of the following systemic risks is considered a market risk:\n",
      "Equity prices\n",
      "We are exposed to changes in equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments. Changes in equity prices can affect the valuation of publicly traded equity shares, investments in private equity, hedge funds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, alternative risk premia investment strategies, and other equity-linked capital market instruments as well as equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities, indexed universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance.\n",
      "Residential and commercial real estate values\n",
      "Our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments. Changes in residential/commercial real estate prices can affect the valuation of residential/commercial mortgages, residential/commercial mortgage-backed securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential/commercial mortgages, trusts that include residential/commercial real estate and/or mortgages, residential mortgage insurance and reinsurance contracts and commercial real estate investments.\n",
      "Interest rates\n",
      "Interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities. Lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and make some of our product offerings less attractive to investors. Conversely, higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons. However, when rates rise quickly, there can be an asymmetric GAAP accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value, which is largely reported through Other comprehensive income, and the offsetting decrease in the value of certain liabilities may not be recognized. Changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, financial liabilities, insurance contracts including but not limited to universal life, fixed rate annuities, variable annuities and derivative contracts. Additionally, for Variable Annuity, Index Annuity, and Equity Indexed Universal Life products, deviations in actual versus expected policyholder behavior can be driven by fluctuations in various market variables, including interest rates. Policies with guaranteed living benefit options or riders are also subject to the risk of actual benefit utilization being different than expected.\n",
      "Credit spreads\n",
      "Credit spreads measure an instrument’s risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default-free instrument. Changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including but not limited to corporate bonds, asset backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, AIG-issued debt obligations, credit derivatives, derivative credit valuation adjustments and economic valuation of insurance liabilities. Much like higher interest rates, wider credit spreads paired with unchanged expectations about default losses imply higher investment income in the long term. In the short term, quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities, which is largely reported through Other comprehensive income. A precipitous widening of credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the credit worthiness of bond obligors, potentially resulting in default losses.\n",
      "Foreign exchange (FX) rates\n",
      "We are a globally diversified enterprise with income, assets and liabilities denominated in, and capital deployed in, a variety of currencies. Changes in FX rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of balance sheet and income statement items as well as the settlement of cash flows exchanged in specific transactions.\n",
      "Commodity prices\n",
      "Changes in commodity prices (the value of commodities) can affect the valuation of publicly-traded commodities, commodity indices, derivatives on commodities and commodity indices, and other commodity-linked investments and insurance contracts. We are exposed to commodity prices primarily through their impact on the prices and credit quality of commodity producers’ debt and equity securities in our investment portfolio.\n",
      "Inflation\n",
      "Changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including AIG-issued debt obligations, derivatives and other contracts explicitly linked to inflation indices, and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly, via indexing, or implicitly, through medical costs or wage levels.\n",

      "Risk Measurement\n",
      "Our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures. At the firm-wide level, market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with AIG’s risk appetite statement. This is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework. The framework measures our overall exposure to change in each of the systemic market risk factors on an economic basis.\n",
      "In addition, we monitor risks through multiple lenses that include economic, GAAP and statutory reporting frameworks at various levels of business consolidation. This process aims to establish a comprehensive coverage of potential implications from adverse market risk developments.\n",
      "We use a number of approaches to measure our market risk exposure, including:\n",
      "Examples include:\n",
      "Sensitivity analysis\n",
      "measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input\n",
      "•a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity securities,\n",

AIG believes that the interest rate sensitivities of these insurance and other liabilities serve as an offset to the net interest rate risk of the financial assets presented in the table below.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",

In addition, $2.6 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations. At December 31, 2018, the analysis covered $278.4 billion of $285.8 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded were $3.5 billion of loans. In addition, $3.9 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations.\n",

At December 31, 2018, the analysis excluded $643 million of AIGLH borrowings, $359 million of Validus borrowings, $168 million of borrowings from FHLB and $331 million of AIG Japan Holdings loans.\n",
      "(d)The balance sheet exposures for equity contracts and variable annuity and other embedded derivatives are also reflected under “Interest rate sensitive liabilities” above, and are not additive.\n",
      "(e)The majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag.\n",
      "The sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed as predictive of our future financial performance. We cannot ensure that actual financial impacts in any particular period will not exceed the amounts indicated above.\n",
      "Interest rate sensitivity is defined as change in value with respect to a 100 basis point parallel shift up in the interest rate environment, calculated as: scenario value minus base value, where base value is the value under the yield curves as of the period end and scenario value is the value reflecting a 100 basis point parallel increase in all yield curves.\n",
      "We evaluate our interest rate risk without considering effects of correlation of changes in levels of interest rate with other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the values of our financial assets and liabilities. This scenario does not measure changes in values resulting from non-parallel shifts in the yield curves, which could produce different results.\n",
      "We evaluate our equity price risk without considering effects of correlation of changes in equity prices with other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the values of our financial assets and liabilities. The stress scenario does not reflect the impact of basis risk, such as projections about the future performance of the underlying contract holder funds and actual fund returns, which we use as a basis for developing our hedging strategy.\n",
      "Foreign currency-denominated net asset position reflects our aggregated non-U.S. dollar assets less our aggregated non-U.S dollar liabilities on a GAAP basis, with certain adjustments. We use a bottom-up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory surplus at the regulated insurance entity level. At the AIG consolidated level, we monitor our foreign currency exposures against single currency and aggregate currency portfolio limits.\n",
      "Our three largest foreign currency-denominated net asset positions at December 31, 2019 are Great Britain pound ($1.8 billion), South Korean won ($331 million), and Australian dollar ($276 million).\n",
      "Our foreign currency-denominated net asset position at December 31, 2019, decreased by $1.4 billion compared to December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.1 billion decrease in our Euro position. The reduction in our Euro position is principally due to currency conversions associated with internal reinsurance agreements and the rebalancing of net assets across European operations due to Brexit. Our Hong Kong dollar position also decreased $550 million, primarily due to the sale of our PICC investment. Offsetting these decreases was a $299 million increase in our Canadian dollar position, primarily due to hedging actions designed to protect statutory surplus at the regulated insurance entity level.\n",
      "For illustrative purposes, we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point parallel increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equity prices and prices of alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar.

      "Overview\n",
      "Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations. Failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in insolvency, reduced operating flexibility, increased costs, reputational harm and regulatory action.\n",
      "AIG and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity both during the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash will be available to meet the obligations as they come due.\n",
      "AIG Parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are designed to allow us to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six months under a liquidity stress scenario. We maintain liquidity limits and minimum coverage ratios designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying stress conditions. If we project that we could breach these tolerances, we assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions. However, the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Liquidity risk is overseen at the corporate level within ERM. The CRO has responsibility for the oversight of the Liquidity Risk Management Framework and delegates the day-to-day implementation of this framework to the AIG Treasurer. Our corporate treasury function manages liquidity risk, subject to ERM oversight and various control processes.\n",
      "The Liquidity Risk Management Framework is guided by the liquidity risk tolerance as set forth in the Board-approved risk appetite statement. The principal objective of this framework is to establish minimum liquidity requirements that protect our long-term viability and ability to fund our ongoing business, and to meet short-term financial obligations in a timely manner in both normal and stressed conditions.\n",
      "Our Liquidity Risk Management Framework includes a number of liquidity and funding policies and monitoring tools to address AIG-specific, broader industry and market-related liquidity events.\n",

      "Market/Monetization Risk\n",
      "Assets may not be readily transformed into cash due to unfavorable market conditions. Market liquidity risk may limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs.\n",
      "Cash Flow Mismatch Risk\n",
      "Discrete and cumulative cash flow mismatches or gaps over short-term horizons under both expected and adverse business conditions may create future liquidity shortfalls.\n",
      "Event Funding Risk\n",
      "Additional funding may be required as the result of a trigger event. Event funding risk comes in many forms and may result from a downgrade in credit ratings, a market event, or some other event that creates a funding obligation or limits existing funding options.\n",
      "Financing Risk\n",
      "We may be unable to raise additional cash on a secured or unsecured basis due to unfavorable market conditions, AIG-specific issues, or any other issue that impedes access to additional funding.\n",
      "Risk Measurement\n",
      "Comprehensive cash flow projections under normal conditions are the primary component for identifying and measuring liquidity risk. We produce comprehensive liquidity projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows. In addition, we perform stress testing by identifying liquidity stress scenarios and assessing the effects of these scenarios on our cash flow and liquidity.\n",
      "We use a number of approaches to measure our liquidity risk exposure, including:\n",
      "Minimum Liquidity Limits\n",
      "Minimum Liquidity Limits specify the amount of assets required to be maintained in order to meet obligations as they arise over a specified time horizon under stressed liquidity conditions.\n",
      "Coverage Ratios\n",
      "Coverage Ratios measure the adequacy of available liquidity sources, including the ability to monetize assets to meet the forecasted cash flows over a specified time horizon. The portfolio of assets is selected based on our ability to convert those assets into cash under the assumed stressed conditions and within the specified time horizon.\n",

ORM supports the Head of Governance and Operational Controls and has responsibility to provide an aggregate view of our operational risk profile. In line with the Three Lines of Defense Model, the ORM program includes, but is not limited to, several key components outlined below:\n",
      "Risk Event Capture - enables every employee to identify, document, and escalate operational risk events, with a view to enhancing processes, promoting lessons learned and embedding a culture of risk management.\n",
      "Risk Assessments - allows for the assessment, measurement and management of the key operational risks within our business units and helps inform on the efficacy of our control environment.\n",
      "Key Risk Indicators - enhances the ongoing monitoring and mitigation of operational risks and facilitate risk reporting.\n",
      "Issues Management - enables a consistent tracking of issues across the firm, including policy and process exceptions, control deficiencies and findings from risk and control assessment activities.\n",
      "Scenario Analyses - executed by first- and second-line professionals to identify potential risks that could result in financial losses to the firm and support the prioritization of operational risk treatment.\n",
      "ORM, working together with other control and assurance functions (e.g., Compliance, Financial Controls Unit / Sarbanes Oxley, Global Business Continuity, and Internal Audit) through the risk and control framework, provides an independent view of operational risks for each business, and works with the business unit and corporate function CRO and Owner of the Control Agenda, whose responsibilities include coordinating identification, assessment, control and mitigation of risks to the operating environment and promoting awareness, to facilitate implementation of the above programs. This includes coverage of operational risks related to core insurance activities, corporate functions, investing, model risk, technology, third-party providers, as well as compliance and regulatory matters. Based on the results of the risk identification and assessment efforts above, business leaders are accountable for tracking and remediating identified issues in line with our risk-monitoring procedures. Governance committees support these efforts and promote transparency enabling improved management decision making.\n",
      "Cybersecurity Risk\n",
      "Cybersecurity risk is an important, constant, and evolving focus for AIG and the insurance and financial services industries in general. The goal of unauthorized parties, using a variety of attack methods, is to gain access to AIG’s data and systems to obtain confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage. One such example, is the increased sophistication and activities of unauthorized parties using phishing in an attempt to access our systems, usually in an effort to obtain sensitive information, which is an ever-present and increasing attack vector against AIG. Cybersecurity risks may also derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of AIG employees or third parties who have authorized access to AIG’s systems or information.\n",

      "Insurance Risks\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "Insurance risk is defined as the risk of actual claims experience and/or policyholder behavior being materially different than initially expected at the inception of an insurance contract. Uncertainties related to insurance risk include the amount and timing of cash flows from premiums, commissions, expenses, claims and claim settlement expenses paid or received under a contract.\n",
      "Except as described above, we manage our business risk oversight activities through our insurance operations. A primary goal in managing our insurance operations is to achieve an acceptable risk-adjusted return on equity. To achieve this goal, we must be disciplined in risk selection, premium adequacy, and appropriate terms and conditions to cover the risk accepted.\n",
      "We operate our insurance businesses on a global basis, and we are exposed to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. We manage these risks throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of processes and procedures:\n",

As part of our established governance practices, key decisions and considerations related to insurance risks can be raised and deferred for discussion and consideration to business unit risk committees that are chaired by the business unit’s chief risk officer. In addition, in some business units, pricing committees review insurance risk considerations associated with pricing of new insurance products. The insurance risk oversight framework includes the following key components:\n",

We manage risks in the General Insurance business through aggregations and limitations of concentrations at multiple levels: policy, line of business, geography, industry and legal entity.\n",
      "Life and Retirement companies - risks include mortality and morbidity in the individual life, individual health-care and group life insurance products, longevity risk in the individual retirement, group retirement and institutional markets products, and policyholder behavior across all product lines. We manage risks through product design, sound medical and non-medical underwriting.\n",
      "We purchase reinsurance for our insurance and reinsurance operations. Reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. We may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis. Pooling of our reinsurance risks enables us to purchase reinsurance more efficiently at a consolidated level, manage global counterparty risk and relationships and manage global catastrophe risks.\n",
      "Risk Measurement, Monitoring and Limits\n",
      "Additionally, there are risk specific assessment tools in place to better manage the variety of insurance risks to which we are exposed.\n",
      "We monitor concentrations of exposure through insurance limits aggregated along dimensions such as geography, industry, or counterparty.\n",
      "The risk monitoring responsibilities of the business units include ensuring compliance with insurance risk limits and escalation and remediation of limit breaches. Such activities are reported to management by the relevant business unit for informative decision-making on a regular basis.

      "General Insurance Companies’ Key Risks\n",
      "We manage our risks through risk review and selection processes, exposure limitations, exclusions, deductibles, self-insured retentions, coverage limits, attachment points, and reinsurance. This management is supported by sound underwriting practices, pricing procedures and the use of actuarial analysis to help determine overall adequacy of provisions for insurance. Underwriting practices and pricing procedures incorporate historical experience, changes in underlying exposure, current regulation and judicial decisions as well as proposed or anticipated regulatory changes or societal trends.\n",
      "For General Insurance companies, risks primarily include the following:\n",
      "Loss Reserves - The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the General Insurance companies. There is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. We manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. For further information see Critical Accounting Estimates - Insurance Liabilities - Loss Reserves.\n",
      "Underwriting - The potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the General Insurance companies’ ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. This may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, or unexpected or increased costs or expenses.\n",
      "Catastrophe Exposure - Our business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect our operating results. Other risks, such as man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n",
      "Single Risk Loss Exposure - Our business is exposed to loss events that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. Events such as fires or explosions can result in loss activity for our clients. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by the Chief Underwriting Officer through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance. Furthermore, single risk loss exposure is managed and monitored on both a segregated and aggregated basis.\n",
      "Reinsurance - Since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated. The inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n",
      "Natural Catastrophe Risk\n",
      "We manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate Probable Maximum Loss (PML) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, modifying our gross underwriting standards, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.\n",
      "We use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. We apply proprietary multi-model approaches, making adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.\n",
      "We perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model inefficiencies, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. Lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts that allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.\n",
      "We recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policies to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. For example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. In addition, we provide insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change. Our internal product development, underwriting, and modeling, will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.\n",
      "Our natural catastrophe exposure to primary modeled perils is principally driven by the U.S. and secondarily Japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries and perils. For example, we have exposures to additional perils such as European windstorms and wildfire exposures across multiple countries.

      "Terrorism Risk\n",
      "We actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. We have set risk limits based on modeled losses from certain terrorism attack scenarios. Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model for various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the General Insurance companies’ exposures. Examples of modeled scenarios are conventional bombs of different sizes, anthrax attacks and nuclear attacks.\n",
      "Our largest terrorism concentrations are in New York City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers’ Compensation lines of business. At our largest exposure location, modeled losses for a five-ton bomb attack net of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (TRIPRA) and reinsurance recoveries are estimated to be $2.4 billion based on the exposures as of October 1, 2019.\n",
      "Our exposure to terrorism risk in the U.S. is mitigated by TRIPRA in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIPRA covers terrorist attacks within the United States or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law. In 2020, TRIPRA covers 80 percent of insured losses above a deductible. The current estimate of our deductible is approximately $2.0 billion for 2019.\n",
      "We offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. We also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n",
      "Life and Retirement Companies’ Key Risks\n",
      "We manage risk through product design, experience monitoring, pricing and underwriting discipline, risk limits, reinsurance and active monitoring and management of the relationships between assets and liabilities, including hedging.\n",
      "For Life and Retirement companies, risks include the following:\n",
      "Longevity risk - represents the risk of an increase in value of an annuity policy or a payout benefit as a result of actual mortality experience being lower than the expected mortality experience. This risk could arise from medical advancement and longer-term societal health changes. This risk exists in a number of our product lines but is most significant for our annuity products.\n",
      "Morbidity risk - represents the risk arising from actual morbidity (e.g. illness, disability or disease) incidence rate being higher than expected or the length of the claims extending longer than expected resulting in a higher overall benefit payout. This risk could arise from longer-term medical advances in detection and treatment for various diseases and medical conditions. This risk exists in a number of our product lines such as accident and health and long -term care businesses which for the most part are in run-off, and ceded to Fortitude Re and U.S. group benefits which AIG has almost fully exited.\n",
      "Mortality risk - represents the risk of loss arising from actual mortality experience being higher than expected mortality experience. This risk could arise from pandemics or other events, including longer-term societal changes that cause higher-than-expected mortality. This risk exists in a number of our product lines, but is most significant for our life insurance products.\n",
      "162 AIG | 2019 Form 10-K\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "Policyholder behavior risk (including full and partial surrender/lapse risk) - represents the risk that actual policyholder behavior differs from expected behavior in a manner that has an adverse effect on our operating results. There are many related assumptions made when products are sold, including how long the contracts will persist and other assumptions which impact the expected utilization of contract benefits, options and guarantees. Actual experience can vary significantly from these assumptions. This risk is impacted by a number of factors including changes in market conditions, especially changes in the levels of interest rate and equity markets, tax law, regulations, competitive landscape and policyholder preferences. This risk exists in many of our product lines, but most notably within the annuity portfolio of business.\n",
      "The emergence of significant adverse experience compared to the initial assumptions at policy issuance or revised expectations would require an adjustment to DAC and benefit reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for a particular period.\n",
      "For additional discussion of the impact of actual and expected experience on DAC and benefit reserves see Critical Accounting Estimates - Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health Insurance Contracts and Critical Accounting Estimates - Guaranteed Benefit Features of Variable Annuity Products. For additional discussion of business risks see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Business and Operations.\n",
      "Variable Annuity, Index Annuity and Universal Life Risk Management and Hedging Programs\n",
      "Our Individual and Group Retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with guaranteed living benefit (GLB) riders that guarantee a certain level of lifetime benefits. GLBs are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses). GLB features subject the Life and Retirement companies to market risk, including exposure to changes in levels of interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility.\n",
      "Variable annuity product design is the first step in managing our exposure to these market risks. Risk mitigation features of our variable annuity product design include GLB rider fees indexed to an equity market volatility index, which can provide additional fee assessments in periods of increased market volatility, required minimum allocations to fixed accounts to reduce overall equity exposure, and for some of the variable annuity products, the utilization of volatility control funds, which have an ability to reduce equity exposures in the funds in response to changes in market volatility, even under sudden or extreme market movements.\n",
      "After reflecting our product risk-mitigating features, we hedge our remaining economic exposure to market risk within GLB features through our variable annuity hedging program, which is designed to offset certain changes in the economic value of these GLB embedded derivatives, within established thresholds. The hedging program is designed to provide additional protection against large and combined movements in levels of interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility under multiple scenarios.\n",
      "Our hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents our estimate of the underlying economic risks in our GLB riders, based on the present value of the future expected benefit payments for the GLB, less the present value of future GLB rider fees, over numerous stochastic scenarios. This stochastic projection method uses best estimate assumptions for policyholder behavior (including mortality, lapses, withdrawals and benefit utilization) in conjunction with market scenarios calibrated to observable equity and interest rate option prices. Policyholder behaviors are regularly evaluated to compare current assumptions to actual experience and, if appropriate, changes are made to the policyholder behavior assumptions. The risk of changes in policyholder behavior is not explicitly hedged, and such differences between expected and actual policyholder behaviors will result in hedge ineffectiveness.\n",
      "Due to differences between the calculation of the value of the economic hedge target and the U.S. GAAP valuation of the embedded derivative, which include differences in the treatment of rider fees and exclusion of certain risk margins and other differences in discount rates, we expect relative movements in the value of the economic hedge target and the U.S. GAAP embedded derivative valuation will vary over time with changes in levels of equity markets, interest rates, credit spreads and volatility.\n",
      "For information on the impact on our consolidated pre-tax income from the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives and the hedging portfolio, as well as additional discussion of differences between the economic hedge target and the valuation of the embedded derivatives see Insurance Reserves - Life and Annuity Reserves and DAC - Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefits and Hedging Results.\n",
      "In designing the hedging portfolio for our variable annuity hedging program, we make assumptions and projections about the future performance of the underlying contract mutual funds. To project future account value changes, we use these assumptions about how each of the underlying mutual funds will perform. We map the mutual funds to a set of publicly traded indices that we believe best represent the liability to be hedged. Basis risk exists due to the variance between fund returns projected under these assumptions and actual fund returns, which may result in variances between changes in the value of the hedging portfolio and changes in the economic value of the hedge target. Net hedge results and the associated cost of hedging are also impacted by differences between realized volatility and implied volatility.\n",
      "AIG | 2019 Form 10-K 163\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "Our hedging programs associated with index annuity and index universal life products, are designed to manage market risk associated with the index crediting strategies offered on these product platforms. These hedging programs are designed to offset economic risk arising in conjunction with index returns, associated with the crediting strategies that will be occurring during the current crediting rate reset period. These programs utilize derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity index options and futures contracts. Similarly, as with the variable annuities, there are differences between the calculation of the value of the economic hedge target and the U.S. GAAP valuation of the index annuity and index life embedded derivatives, which can lead to variances in their relative movements.\n",
      "To manage the capital market exposures embedded within the economic hedge target, we identify and hedge market sensitivities to changes in equity markets, interest rates, volatility and for variable annuities, credit spreads. Each hedge program purchases derivative instruments or securities having sensitivities that offset corresponding sensitivities in the associated economic hedge targets, within internally defined threshold limits. Since the relative movements of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target vary over time or with market changes, the net exposure can be outside the threshold limits, and adjustments to the hedging portfolio are made periodically to return the net exposure to within the threshold limits.\n",
      "Our hedging programs utilize various derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts, interest rate swaps and swaptions, as well as other hedging instruments. In addition, within the variable annuities hedging program, we purchase certain fixed income securities. The majority of these securities are classified as available for sale, with a relatively small portion for which we elect the fair value option. To minimize counterparty credit risk the majority of the derivative instruments utilized within the hedging programs are cleared through global exchanges. Over the counter derivatives utilized within the hedging programs are highly collateralized.\n",
      "The hedging programs are monitored on a daily basis to ensure that the economic hedge targets and the associated derivative portfolios are within the threshold limits, pursuant to the approved hedging strategies. Daily risk monitoring verifies that the net risk exposures are within the approved net risk exposure threshold limits. In addition, monthly stress tests are performed to determine the program’s effectiveness relative to the applicable limits, under an array of combined severe market stresses in equity prices, interest rates, volatility and credit spreads. Finally, hedging strategies are reviewed regularly to gauge their effectiveness in managing our market exposures in the context of our overall risk appetite.\n",
      "Reinsurance Activities\n",
      "Reinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss (Life and Non-Life) exposure related to certain events, such as natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, or single policy level events. Our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.\n",
      "Reinsurance markets include:\n",
      "Traditional local and global reinsurance markets including those in the United States, Bermuda, London and Europe, accessed directly and through reinsurance intermediaries;\n",
      "Capital markets through insurance-linked securities and collateralized reinsurance transactions, such as catastrophe bonds, sidecars and similar vehicles; and\n",
      "Other insurers that engage in both direct and assumed reinsurance.\n",
      "The form of reinsurance we may choose from time to time will generally depend on whether we are seeking:\n",

      "facultative contracts that reinsure individual policies.\n",
      "We continually evaluate the relative attractiveness of different forms of reinsurance contracts and different markets that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives.\n",
      "Reinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. However, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.\n",
      "In certain markets, we are required to participate on a proportional basis in reinsurance pools based on our relative share of direct writings in those markets. Such mandatory reinsurance generally covers higher-risk consumer exposures such as assigned-risk automobile and earthquake, as well as certain commercial exposures such as workers’ compensation.\n",

      "Reinsurance Recoverable\n",
      "AIG’s reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of:\n",
      "Paid losses recoverable - balances due from reinsurers for losses and loss adjustment expenses paid by our subsidiaries and billed, but not yet collected.\n",
      "Ceded loss reserves - ultimate ceded reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, including reserves for claims reported but not yet paid and estimates for IBNR.\n",
      "Ceded reserves for unearned premiums.\n",
      "Life and Annuity reinsurance recoverables (ceded policy and claim reserves and policyholder contract deposits).\n",
      "At December 31, 2019, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $38.0 billion. These assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $1.8 billion, ceded loss reserves of $31.4 billion including reserves for IBNR claims, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $3.2 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverable of $1.5 billion. The methods used to estimate IBNR and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. These methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments are reflected in income. We believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at December 31, 2019 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. Actual losses may, however, differ from the reserves currently ceded.\n",
      "The Reinsurance Credit Department (RCD) conducts periodic detailed assessments of the financial strength and condition of current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic. The RCD monitors both the financial condition of reinsurers as well as the total reinsurance recoverable ceded to reinsurers, and sets limits with regard to the amount and type of exposure we are willing to take with reinsurers. As part of these assessments, we attempt to identify whether a reinsurer is appropriately licensed, assess its financial capacity and liquidity, and evaluate the local economic and financial environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates. The RCD reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for measures, including collateral to mitigate credit risk. For example, in our treaty reinsurance contracts, we frequently include provisions that require a reinsurer to post collateral or use other measures to reduce exposure when a referenced event occurs. Furthermore, we limit our unsecured exposure to reinsurers through the use of credit triggers such as insurer financial strength rating downgrades, declines in regulatory capital, or relevant risk-based capital (RBC) ratios fall below certain levels. We also set maximum limits for reinsurance recoverable exposure, which in some cases is the recoverable amount plus an estimate of the maximum potential exposure from unexpected events for a reinsurer. In addition, credit executives within ERM review reinsurer exposures and credit limits and approve reinsurer credit limits above specified levels. Finally, even where we conclude that uncollateralized credit risk is acceptable, we require collateral from active reinsurance counterparties where it is necessary for our subsidiaries to recognize the reinsurance recoverable assets for statutory accounting purposes. At December 31, 2019, we held $23.1 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers.\n",
      "The following table presents information for each reinsurer representing in excess of five percent of our total reinsurance recoverable assets:\n",

      "At December 31, 2019, we had no significant reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. Reduced profitability associated with lower rates could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. The RCD, in conjunction with the credit executives within ERM, reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require the reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.\n",

      "We utilize derivatives principally to enable us to hedge exposure associated with changes in levels of interest rates, currencies, credit, commodities, equity prices and other risks. Credit risk associated with derivative counterparties exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to us. The maximum potential exposure will increase or decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions. All derivative transactions must be transacted within counterparty limits that have been approved by ERM.\n",
      "We evaluate counterparty credit quality via an internal analysis that is consistent with the AIG Credit Policy. We utilize various credit enhancements, including letters of credit, guarantees, collateral, credit triggers, credit derivatives, margin agreements and subordination to reduce the credit risk related to outstanding financial derivative transactions. We require credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties, and transaction size and maturity. Furthermore, we enter into certain agreements that have the benefit of set-off and close-out netting provisions, such as ISDA Master Agreements. These provisions provide that, in the case of an early termination of a transaction, we can set off receivables from a counterparty against payables to the same counterparty arising out of all covered transactions. As a result, where a legally enforceable netting agreement exists, the fair value of the transaction with the counterparty represents the net sum of estimated fair values.\n",

      "Dividends and Repurchases of AIG Common Stock\n",
      "On February 12, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.125 per share, payable on March 26, 2015 to shareholders of record on March 12, 2015. On April 30, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.125 per share, payable on June 25, 2015 to shareholders of record on June 11, 2015. On August 3, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.28 per share, payable on September 28, 2015 to shareholders of record on September 14, 2015. On November 2, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.28 per share, payable on December 21, 2015 to shareholders of record on December 7, 2015.\n",
      "On February 11, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.32 per share, payable on March 28, 2016 to shareholders of record on March 14, 2016. The payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including the regulatory framework applicable to us, as discussed further in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of shares of AIG Common Stock through a series of actions. On December 16, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized an additional increase of $3.0 billion to the previous share repurchase authorization.\n",
      "During 2015, we repurchased approximately 182 million shares of AIG Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $10.7 billion pursuant to this authorization. The total number of shares of AIG Common Stock repurchased in 2015 includes (but the aggregate purchase price does not include) approximately 3.5 million shares of AIG Common Stock received in January 2015 upon the settlement of an ASR agreement executed in the fourth quarter of 2014. Pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plans, from January 1 to February 11, 2016, we have repurchased approximately $2.5 billion of additional shares of AIG Common Stock.\n",
      "On February 11, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an additional increase to the repurchase authorization of AIG Common Stock of $5.0 billion, resulting in a remaining authorization on such date of approximately $5.8 billion. Shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market, private purchases, through forward, derivative, accelerated repurchase or automatic repurchase transactions or otherwise (including through the purchase of warrants). Certain of our share repurchases have been and may from time to time be effected through Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plans. The timing of any future share repurchases will depend on market conditions, our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors, including the regulatory framework applicable to us.\n",
      "Dividend Restrictions\n",

      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "Risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns. We consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance.\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "Risk Governance Structure\n",
      "Our risk governance structure fosters the development and maintenance of a risk and control culture that encompasses all significant risk categories. Accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit. We review our governance and committee structure on a regular basis and make changes as appropriate to continue to effectively manage and govern our risks and risk-taking.\n",
      "Our Board of Directors oversees the management of risk through its Risk and Capital Committee (RCC) and Audit Committee. Those committees regularly interact with other committees of the Board of Directors. Our Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reports to both the RCC and our Chief Executive Officer (CEO).\n",
      "The Group Risk Committee (GRC): The GRC is the senior management group charged with assessing all significant risk issues on a global basis to protect our financial strength, optimize our intrinsic value, and protect our reputation. The GRC is chaired by our CRO. Its membership includes our CEO, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and other executives from across our corporate functions and business units. Our CRO reports periodically on behalf of the GRC to both the RCC and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Our CRO is also a member of the management strategy committee providing ERM the opportunity to review, monitor and consider the impact of changes in strategy.\n",
      "Management committees that support the GRC are described below. These committees are comprised of senior executives and experienced business representatives from a range of functions and business units throughout AIG and its subsidiaries. These committees are charged with identifying, analyzing and reviewing specific risk matters within their respective mandates.\n",
      "Financial Risk Group (FRG): The FRG is responsible for the oversight of financial risks taken by us and our subsidiaries. Its mandate includes overseeing our aggregate credit, market, interest rate, capital, liquidity and model risks, as well as asset-\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "liability management, derivatives activity, and foreign exchange transactions. It provides the primary corporate-level review function for all proposed transactions and business practices that are significant in size, complex in scope, or that present heightened legal, reputational, accounting or regulatory risks. Membership of the FRG includes our CFO, CRO, Chief Investment Officer and Chief Strategy Officer.\n",
      "Operational Risk Committee (ORC): This committee oversees operational risk management activities across our businesses, functions, and geographic locations. The ORC reviews the enterprise-wide identification, escalation and mitigation of operational risks that may arise from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or external events. The ORC also monitors current and emerging operational risks, as well as management actions taken to reduce risks to acceptable levels. The ORC approves the Operational Risk Management (ORM) Policy and ORM Framework, which includes the identification, assessment, monitoring and measurement of risks. The ORC ensures applicable governance structures are established to provide oversight of operational risk at each business unit and corporate function. The ORC also reviews aggregate firm-wide operational risk reports and provides a forum for senior management to assess our operational risk profile and to discuss operational risks that may affect our strategic objectives.\n",
      "ORC members include senior AIG executives with expertise in legal, compliance, technology, human resources, finance and operational risk, as well as business continuity management and the chief risk officer of our business units.\n",
      "Business Unit Risk and Capital Committees: Each of our major insurance businesses has established a risk committee that serves as the senior management committee responsible for risk oversight at the individual business unit level. The risk committees are responsible for the identification, assessment and monitoring of all sources of risk within their respective portfolios. Specific responsibilities include setting risk tolerances, reviewing capital management strategies (including asset allocation and risk financing), insurance portfolio optimization, risk management policies and providing oversight of risk-adjusted metrics. In addition, each business unit has established subordinate committees which identify, assess and monitor the specific operational, transactional and financial risks inherent in its respective business. Together, the committees described above provide comprehensive risk oversight throughout the organization.\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement\n",
      "Risk Appetite Framework\n",
      "Our Risk Appetite Framework integrates stakeholder interests, strategic business goals and available financial resources. We balance these by seeking to take measured risks that are expected to generate repeatable, sustainable earnings and create long-term value for our shareholders. The framework includes our Risk Appetite Statement approved by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof and a set of supporting tools, including risk tolerances, risk limits and policies, which we use to manage our risk profile and financial resources.\n",
      "We articulate our aggregate risk-taking by setting risk tolerances on capital and liquidity measures. These measures are set at the AIG Parent as well as the legal entity level and cover consolidated and insurance company capital and liquidity ratios. We must comply with standards for capital adequacy and maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all our obligations as they come due in accordance with our internal capital management and liquidity policies. Our risk tolerances take into consideration regulatory requirements, rating agency expectations, and business needs. The GRC routinely reviews the level of risk taken by the consolidated organization in relation to the established risk tolerances. A consolidated risk report is also presented periodically, as required, to the RCC by our CRO.\n",
      "Risk Limits\n",
      "A key component of our Risk Appetite Framework is having a process in place that establishes and maintains appropriate limits on the material risks identified for our core businesses and facilitates monitoring and meeting of both internal and external stakeholder expectations. Our objectives include:\n",
      "• Monitoring of risks, providing early warning indicators, and ensuring timely oversight and enforceability;\n",
      "• Defining a consistent and transparent approach to limits governance from the group-level to regional entities; and\n",
      "• Alignment with Risk Appetite Statement, where applicable.\n",
      "To support the monitoring and management of AIG’s and its business units’ material risks, ERM has an established limits framework that employs a three-tiered hierarchy:\n",
      "• Level I Limits are AIG consolidated level limits. They define our aggregate maximum exposures for core risks within the boundaries set by the Risk Appetite Statement, and constrain our concentration in specific risk types. These limits are set to manage key risks identified by ERM and to meet requirements by regulators and rating agencies at a consolidated level. Level 1 Limits are reported to the FRG, GRC and RCC.\n",
      "• Level II Limits are business unit level limits. They define our appetite for specific, material risk taking activities within business units and corporate functions. These key risks are identified by ERM for the business unit and/or corporate function, and risk limits are developed to meet the specific requirements of regulators and rating agencies. Level II Limits are reported to the business unit RCCs, where applicable.\n",
      "• Level III Limits monitor risk utilization on the regional or local level and are developed to address any specific requirements by regulators and rating agencies for that region not captured by the Level I and Level II limits. Level III Limits are reported at the local entity risk committee.\n",
      "All limits are reviewed by the FRG, GRC or relevant business unit RCCs on a periodic basis and revisions, if applicable, are approved by those committees.\n",
      "The business units are responsible for measuring and monitoring their risk exposures. ERM is responsible for monitoring compliance with limits and providing regular, timely reporting to our senior management and risk committees. Limit breaches\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "are required to be reported in a timely manner and are documented and escalated in accordance with their level of severity or materiality.\n",
      "Risk Identification and Measurement\n",
      "One tool we use to inform our Risk Appetite Framework is risk identification. We conduct risk identification through a number of processes at the business unit and corporate level focused on capturing our material risks and key areas of focus for follow-up risk management actions. A key initiative is our integrated bottom-up risk identification and assessment process down to the product-line level. These processes are used as a critical input to enhance and develop our analytics for measuring and assessing risks across the organization.\n",
      "We employ various approaches to measure, monitor, and manage risk exposures, including the utilization of a variety of metrics and early warning indicators. We use a proprietary stress testing framework to measure our quantifiable risks. This framework is built on our existing ERM stress testing methodology for both insurance and non-insurance operations.\n",
      "The framework measures risk over multiple time horizons and under different levels of stress. We develop a range of stress scenarios based both on internal experience and regulatory guidance. The stress tests are intended to ensure that sufficient resources are available under both idiosyncratic and systemic market stress conditions.\n",
      "The stress testing framework assesses our aggregate exposure to our most significant financial and insurance risks, including the risk in each of our key insurance company subsidiaries in relation to its capital needs under stress, risks inherent in our non-insurance company subsidiaries, and risks to AIG consolidated capital. We use this information to determine the resources needed at the AIG Parent level to support our subsidiaries and capital resources required to maintain consolidated company target capitalization levels.\n",
      "Credit Risk Management\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "Credit risk is defined as the risk that our customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due. Credit risk may also result from a downgrade of a counterparty’s credit ratings or a widening of its credit spreads.\n",
      "We devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures. These exposures may arise from, but are not limited to, fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees and letters of credit.\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Our credit risks are managed by a team of investment professionals, subject to ERM oversight and various control processes. ERM is assisted by credit functions headed by highly experienced credit professionals. Their primary role is to assure appropriate credit risk management in accordance with our credit policies and procedures relative to our credit risk parameters. Our Chief Credit Officer (CCO) and credit executives are primarily responsible for the development, implementation and maintenance of a risk management framework, which includes the following elements related to our credit risks:\n",
      "• developing and implementing our company-wide credit policies and procedures;\n",
      "• approving delegated credit authorities to our credit executives and qualified investment professionals;\n",
      "• developing methodologies for quantification and assessment of credit risks, including the establishment and maintenance of our internal risk rating process;\n",
      "• managing a system of credit and program limits, as well as the approval process for credit transactions, above limit exposures, and concentrations of risk that may exist or be incurred;\n",
      "• evaluating, monitoring, reviewing and reporting of credit risks and concentrations regularly with senior management; and\n",
      "• approving appropriate credit reserves, credit-related other-than-temporary impairments and corresponding methodologies for all credit portfolios.\n",
      "We monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require mitigants, such as third-party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, including commercial bank-issued letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. We treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, and letters of credit as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data. We also monitor closely the quality of any trust collateral accounts.\n",
      "See Investments - Available for Sale Investments herein for further information on our credit concentrations and credit exposures.\n",
      "Market Risk Management\n",
      "Market risk is defined as the risk of adverse impact due to systemic movements in one or more of the following market risk drivers: equity and commodity prices, residential and commercial real estate values, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange, inflation, and their levels of volatility.\n",
      "We are engaged in a variety of insurance, investment and other financial services businesses that generate market risk, directly and indirectly. We are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities, on both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet through on and off-balance sheet exposures. The chief risk officer within each business is responsible for creating a framework to properly identify these risks, then ensuring that they are appropriately measured, monitored and managed in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the Chief Market Risk Officer (CMRO).\n",
      "The scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains documented risk-taking authorities, defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner consistent with our Risk Appetite Statement. Our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in these broad market observables, as opposed to from the idiosyncratic risks associated with individual assets that are addressed through our credit risk management function.\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "Risk Identification\n",
      "Market risk focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in broad, external, predominantly market observable risks. Financial repercussions can include an adverse impact on results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital.\n",
      "Each of the following systemic risks is considered a market risk:\n",
      "Equity prices. We are exposed to changes in equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments. Changes in equity prices can affect the valuation of publicly-traded equity shares, investments in private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other equity-linked capital market instruments as well as equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance.\n",
      "Residential and commercial real estate values. Our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments. Changes in residential/commercial real estate prices can affect the valuation of residential/commercial mortgages, residential/commercial mortgage-backed securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential/commercial mortgages: trusts that include residential/commercial real estate and/or mortgages, residential mortgage insurance contracts and commercial real estate investments.\n",
      "Interest rates. Interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities. Lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and make certain of our product offerings less attractive to investors. Conversely, higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons. However, when rates rise quickly, there can be a temporary asymmetric U.S. GAAP accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income, and the offsetting decrease in the value of related liabilities may not be recognized. Changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, financial liabilities, insurance contracts including but not limited to fixed rate annuities, variable annuities and derivative contracts.\n",
      "Credit spreads. Credit spreads measure an instrument’s risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default-free instrument. Changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including but not limited to corporate bonds, ABS, mortgage-backed securities, AIG-issued debt obligations, credit derivatives and derivative credit valuation adjustments. Much like higher interest rates, wider credit spreads with unchanged default losses mean more investment income in the long-term. In the short term, quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income. A precipitous rise in credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the credit-worthiness of bond obligors, potentially resulting in default losses.\n",
      "Foreign exchange (FX) rates. We are a globally diversified enterprise with significant income, assets and liabilities denominated in, and significant capital deployed in, a variety of currencies. Changes in FX rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of balance sheet and income statement items as well as the settlement of cash flows exchanged in specific transactions.\n",
      "Commodity Prices. Changes in commodity prices (the value of commodities) can affect the valuation of publicly-traded commodities, commodity indices and derivatives on commodities and commodity indices. We are exposed to commodity prices primarily through their impact on the prices and credit quality of commodity producers’ debt and equity securities in our investment portfolio.\n",
      "Inflation. Changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including AIG-issued debt obligations, derivatives and other contracts explicitly linked to inflation indices, and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly, via indexing, or implicitly, through medical costs or wage levels.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Market risk is overseen at the corporate level within ERM through the CMRO, who reports directly to the AIG CRO. The CMRO is supported by a dedicated team of professionals within ERM. Market Risk is managed by our finance, treasury and\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "investment management corporate functions, collectively, and in partnership with ERM. The CMRO is primarily responsible for the development and maintenance of a risk management framework that includes the following key components:\n",
      "• written policies that define the rules for our market risk-taking activities and provide clear guidance regarding their execution and management;\n",
      "• a limit framework that aligns with our Board-approved Risk Appetite Statement;\n",
      "• independent measurement, monitoring and reporting for line of business, business unit and enterprise-wide market risks; and\n",
      "• clearly defined authorities for all individuals and committee roles and responsibilities related to market risk management.\n",
      "These components facilitate the CMRO’s identification, measurement, monitoring, reporting and management of our market risks.\n",
      "Risk Measurement\n",
      "Our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures. At the firm-wide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with AIG’s Risk Appetite Statement. This is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework. Our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital and liquidity levels. At the market risk level, the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change on an economic basis.\n",
      "In addition, we continue to use enhanced economic, U.S. GAAP accounting and statutory capital-based risk measures at the market risk level, business-unit level and firm-wide levels. This process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures.\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "Market Risk Sensitivities\n",
      "The following table provides estimates of our sensitivity to changes in yield curves, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates:\n",
      "(a) At December 31, 2015, the analysis covered $279.6 billion of $298.7 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded were $10.7 billion of loans and $3.6 billion of investments in life settlements. In addition, $4.8 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations. At December 31, 2014, the analysis covered $290.4 billion of $308.9 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded were $8.4 billion of loans and $3.8 billion of investments in life settlements. In addition, $6.3 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations.\n",
      "(b) Includes our investments in PICC Group and PICC P&C.\n",
      "(c) In September 2015, we sold the remainder of our ordinary shares of AerCap. Our 2014 sensitivity calculation for AerCap was based on our carrying value rather than the stock price as of the applicable date, as we applied the equity method of accounting prior to the sale.\n",
      "(d) The majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag.\n",
      "Foreign currency-denominated net asset position reflects our consolidated non-U.S. dollar assets less our consolidated non-U.S dollar liabilities on a U.S. GAAP basis. We use a bottom-up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory capital at the regulated insurance entity level. We manage cash flow risk on our foreign currency-denominated debt issued by AIG Parent and use a variety of techniques to mitigate this risk, including but not limited to the execution of cross-currency swaps and the issuance of new foreign currency-denominated debt to replace equivalent maturing debt. At the AIG Parent level, we monitor our foreign currency exposures against single currency and\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "aggregate currency portfolio limits. As a matter of general practice, we do not typically hedge our foreign currency exposures to net investments in subsidiaries.\n",
      "At December 31, 2015, our foreign currency-denominated net asset position decreased by $1.3 billion, or 11.2 percent, compared to December 31, 2014. The decrease was mostly due to a $1.7 billion decrease in our British pound position, primarily resulting from the unwinding of a cross-currency swap and a $737 million decrease in our Hong Kong dollar position, primarily resulting from the sale of ordinary shares in PICC P&C. These decreases were partially offset by a $1.3 billion increase in our euro position, primarily resulting from debt repurchases and hedging.\n",
      "For illustrative purposes, we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The estimated results presented in the table above should not be taken as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events.\n",
      "The sensitivity factors utilized for 2015 and presented above were selected based on historical data from 1995 to 2015, as follows (see the table below):\n",
      "• a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve is consistent with a one standard deviation movement of the benchmark ten-year treasury yield;\n",
      "• a 20 percent drop for equity and alternative investments is broadly consistent with a one standard deviation movement in the S&P 500; and\n",
      "• a 10 percent depreciation of foreign currency exchange rates is consistent with a one standard deviation movement in the U.S. dollar (USD)/Great Britain pound (GBP) exchange rate.\n",
      "Risk Monitoring and Limits\n",
      "The risk monitoring responsibilities, owned by the business units, include ensuring compliance with market risk limits and escalation and remediation of limit breaches. Such activities must be reported to the ERM Market Risk team by the relevant business unit. This monitoring approach is aligned with our overall risk limits framework.\n",
      "To control our exposure to market risk, we rely on a three-tiered hierarchy of limits that the CMRO closely monitors and reports to our CRO, senior management and risk committees.\n",
      "See Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement - Risk Limits herein for further information on our three-tiered hierarchy of limits.\n",
      "Liquidity Risk Management\n",
      "Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations. Failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in insolvency, reduced operating flexibility, increased costs, reputational harm and regulatory action.\n",
      "AIG and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity during both the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash can be generated to meet the obligations as they come due.\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "AIG Parent liquidity risk tolerance levels allow it to meet its obligations over a twelve month horizon consistent with its risk appetite. We maintain a target range for required liquidity and minimum coverage ratios designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions. If we project that we will breach these tolerances, we will assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions. However, the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements.\n",
      "Risk Identification\n",
      "The following sources of liquidity and funding risks could impact our ability to meet short-term financial obligations as they come due.\n",
      "• Market/Monetization Risk: Assets cannot be readily transformed into cash due to unfavorable market conditions. Market liquidity risk may limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs.\n",
      "• Cash Flow Mismatch Risk: Discrete and cumulative cash flow mismatches or gaps over short-term horizons under both expected and adverse business conditions may create future liquidity shortfalls.\n",
      "• Event Funding Risk: Additional funding is required as the result of a trigger event. Event funding risk comes in many forms and may result from a downgrade in credit ratings, a market event, or some other event that creates a funding obligation or limits existing funding options.\n",
      "• Financing Risk: We are unable to raise additional cash on a secured or unsecured basis due to unfavorable market conditions, AIG-specific issues, or any other issue that impedes access to additional funding.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Liquidity risk is overseen at the corporate level within ERM through the CMRO, who reports directly to the AIG CRO. The AIG CRO has responsibility for the oversight of the Liquidity Risk Management Framework and delegates the day-to-day implementation of this framework to the AIG Treasurer. Our corporate treasury function manages liquidity risk, subject to ERM oversight and various control processes.\n",
      "The Liquidity Risk Management Framework is guided by the liquidity risk tolerance as set forth in the Board-approved Risk Appetite Statement. The principal objective of this framework is to establish minimum liquidity requirements that protect our long-term viability and ability to fund our ongoing business, and to meet short-term financial obligations in a timely manner in both normal and stressed conditions.\n",
      "Our Liquidity Risk Management Framework includes a number of liquidity and funding policies and monitoring tools to address AIG-specific, broader industry and market related liquidity events.\n",
      "Risk Measurement\n",
      "Comprehensive cash flow projections under normal conditions are the primary component for identifying and measuring liquidity risk. We produce comprehensive liquidity projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows. In addition, we perform stress testing by identifying liquidity stress scenarios and assessing the effects of these scenarios on our cash flow and liquidity.\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "Relevant liquidity reporting is produced and reported regularly to AIG Parent and business unit risk committees. The frequency, content, and nature of reporting will vary for each business unit and legal entity, based on its complexity, risk profile, activities and size.\n",
      "Operational Risk Management\n",
      "Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss, or other adverse consequences, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or from external events. Operational risk includes legal, regulatory and compliance risks, but excludes business and strategy risks.\n",
      "Operational risk is inherent in each of our business units. Operational risks can have many impacts, including but not limited to: unexpected economic losses or gains, reputational harm due to negative publicity, regulatory action from supervisory agencies, operational and business disruptions, and/or damage to customer relationships.\n",
      "ORM oversees the Operational Risk policy and framework, which includes risk identification, assessment, prioritization, measurement, monitoring, and reporting of operational risk. As part of the framework, we deploy a series of operational risk programs to support our business units with the identification, monitoring and reporting of operational risks. The ORM programs include, but are not limited to, several key components as outlined below:\n",
      "• The Risk Event Capture process enables each employee to identify, document, and escalate operational risk impacts, with a view to enhancing, processes and promoting lessons learned.\n",
      "• The Vulnerability Identification (VID) process identifies emerging risks, which we consider to be risks that have not yet fully manifested themselves but could become significant over time.\n",
      "• The Ordinal Risk Ranking effort provides an ordinal ranking of the firm’s most significant operational risks at the Enterprise, Segment or Regional levels, with the goal of prioritizing assessment and remediation activity.\n",
      "• The Risk and Control Self-Assessments (RCSAs) allow for the identification and assessment of the key operational risks within our respective business units and a determination as to whether the related controls are effective.\n",
      "• Scenario Analyses are executed to identify the remote, but plausible, potential risks that could result in severe financial losses.\n",
      "ORM, working together with other key second lines of defense functions (e.g., Model Validation and the Technology Risk office, as well as Compliance, SOX, and Global Business Continuity), provides an independent view of Operational Risk for each business, and works with the business to facilitate implementation of the above programs. This includes coverage of operational risks related to core insurance activities, investing, model risk, technology (including cyber security, access, data\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "privacy and data security), third-party providers, as well as compliance and regulatory matters. Based on the results of the risk identification and assessment efforts above, business leaders are accountable for tracking and remediating identified issues in line with our risk monitoring procedures. Governance committees support these efforts and promote transparency and management decision making.\n",
      "Insurance Risks\n",
      "Except as described above, we manage our business risk oversight activities through our insurance operations. A primary goal in managing our insurance operations is to achieve an acceptable risk-adjusted return on equity. To achieve this goal, we must be disciplined in risk selection, premium adequacy, and appropriate terms and conditions to cover the risk accepted.\n",
      "We operate our insurance businesses on a global basis, and we are exposed to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. We manage these risks throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of procedures:\n",
      "• pre-launch approval of product design, development and distribution;\n",
      "• underwriting approval processes and authorities;\n",
      "• exposure limits with ongoing monitoring;\n",
      "• management of relationship between assets and liabilities, including hedging;\n",
      "• enhanced pricing models;\n",
      "• modeling and reporting of aggregations and limit concentrations at multiple levels (policy, line of business, product group, country, individual/group, correlation and catastrophic risk events);\n",
      "• compliance with financial reporting and capital and solvency targets;\n",
      "• use of reinsurance, both internal and third-party; and\n",
      "• review and establishment of reserves.\n",
      "We closely manage insurance risk by monitoring and controlling the nature and geographic location of the risks in each line of business underwritten, the terms and conditions of the underwriting and the premiums we charge for taking on the risk. We analyze concentrations of risk using various modeling techniques, including both probability distributions (stochastic) and/or single-point estimates (deterministic) approaches.\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "Risk Identification\n",
      "• Non-Life Insurance Companies - risks covered include property, casualty, fidelity/surety, accident and health, aviation, management liability and mortgage insurance. We manage risks in the general insurance business through aggregations and limitations of concentrations at multiple levels: policy, line of business, geography, industry and legal entity. We manage risks in the mortgage insurance business through geographic classification, risk based pricing, premium adequacy monitoring, and prudent credit policy and underwriting standards.\n",
      "• Life Insurance Companies - risks include mortality and morbidity in the insurance-oriented products and insufficient cash flows to cover contract liabilities and longevity risk in the retirement savings-oriented products. We manage risks through product design, sound medical and non-medical underwriting, and external reinsurance programs.\n",
      "We purchase reinsurance for our insurance operations. Reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. We may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis. Pooling of our reinsurance risks enables us to purchase reinsurance more efficiently at a consolidated level, manage global counterparty risk and relationships and manage global catastrophe risks, both for the Non-Life Insurance Companies and the Life Insurance Companies.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Insurance risks are monitored at the business unit level within ERM and overseen by the business unit chief risk officer, who reports directly to our CRO. The framework includes the following key components:\n",
      "• written policies that define the rules for our insurance risk-taking activities;\n",
      "• a limit framework focused on key insurance risks that aligns with our Board-approved Risk Appetite Statement; and\n",
      "• clearly defined authorities for all individuals and committee roles and responsibilities related to insurance risk management.\n",
      "Risk Measurement, Monitoring and Limits\n",
      "In addition, we monitor concentrations of exposure through insurance limits aggregated along dimensions such as geography, industry, or counterparty.\n",
      "The risk monitoring responsibilities of the business units include ensuring compliance with insurance risk limits and escalation and remediation of limit breaches. Such activities are reported to management by the relevant business unit for informative decision-making on a regular basis. This monitoring approach is aligned with our overall risk limits framework.\n",
      "Risk limits have a consistent framework used across AIG, its business units, and legal entities. This includes escalation thresholds in cases where measurement is particularly challenging.\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "See Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement - Risk Limits herein for further information on our three-tiered hierarchy of limits\n",
      "Non-Life Insurance Companies Key Insurance Risks\n",
      "We manage insurance risks through risk review and selection processes, exposure limitations, exclusions, deductibles, self-insured retentions, coverage limits, attachment points, and reinsurance. This management is supported by sound underwriting practices, pricing procedures and the use of actuarial analysis to help determine overall adequacy of provisions for insurance. Underwriting practices and pricing procedures incorporate historical experience, changes in underlying exposure, current regulation and judicial decisions as well as proposed or anticipated regulatory changes.\n",
      "For Non-Life Insurance Companies, insurance risks primarily include the following:\n",
      "• Liability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses - The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the Non-Life Insurance Companies. There is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. We manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. See Item 1. Business - A review of Liability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses herein for further information.\n",
      "• Underwriting - The potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the Non-Life Insurance Companies’ ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. This may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, worse than expected prepayment of policies, investment results, or unexpected or increased costs or expenses.\n",
      "• Catastrophe Exposure - Our business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect our operating results. Other risks, such as man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n",
      "• Single Risk Loss Exposure - Our business is exposed to loss events that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. Events such as fires or explosions can result in loss activity for our clients. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by our GRC through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance. Furthermore, single risk loss exposure is managed and monitored on both a segregated and aggregated basis.\n",
      "• Reinsurance - Since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers either due to an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event, or that actual reinsurance coverage is different than anticipated. The inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n",
      "Natural Catastrophe Risk\n",
      "We manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate Probable Maximum Loss (PML) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.\n",
      "We use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. We apply a proprietary multi-model approach to account for\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "relative strengths and weaknesses of vendor models, and make adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.\n",
      "We perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model weaknesses, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. Lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts which allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.\n",
      "We recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policy to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. For example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. In addition, we are committed to providing innovative insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change, including expanding natural disaster resilience, promoting adaptation, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Our internal product development, underwriting, modeling, and sustainability practices will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.\n",
      "Our natural catastrophe exposure is primarily driven by the U.S. and Japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries. For example, we have exposures to additional perils such as European windstorms and floods. Within the U.S., we have significant hurricane exposure in Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, Northeast U.S. and mid-Atlantic regions. Events impacting the Northeast U.S. and the mid-Atlantic may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in those regions. Within the U.S., we have significant earthquake exposure in California, the Pacific Northwest and New Madrid regions. Earthquakes impacting the Pacific Northwest and New Madrid regions may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in these regions.\n",
      "The estimates below are the Occurrence Exceedance Probability (OEP) losses, which reflect losses that may occur in any single event due to the defined peril. The 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 PMLs are the probable maximum losses from a single natural catastrophe event with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent in a year, respectively.\n",
      "The following table presents an overview of OEP modeled losses for top perils and countries.\n",
      "(a) The U.S. hurricane amount includes losses to Property from hurricane hazards of wind and storm surge.\n",
      "(b) U.S. earthquake loss estimates represent exposure to Property, Workers’ Compensation (U.S.) and A&H business lines.\n",
      "(c) Japan Earthquake represents exposure to Property and A&H business lines.\n",
      "The OEP estimates provided above reflect our in-force portfolios at September 30, 2015, for both U.S. and Japan exposures. The catastrophe reinsurance program is as of January 1, 2016.\n",
      "As noted above, AIG, along with other non-life insurance and reinsurance companies, utilizes industry-recognized catastrophe models and apply their proprietary modeling processes and assumptions to arrive at loss estimates. The use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially change the projected losses. Since there is no industry standard for assumptions and preparation of insured data for use in these models, modeled losses may not be comparable to estimates made by other companies.\n",
      "Also, the modeled results are based on the assumption that all reinsurers fulfill their obligations to us under the terms of the reinsurance arrangements and all catastrophe bonds attach and pay as modeled. However, reinsurance recoverable may not be fully collectible. In particular, the use of catastrophe bonds may not provide commensurate levels of protection compared to\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "traditional reinsurance transactions. Therefore, these estimates are inherently uncertain and may not accurately reflect our exposure to these events.\n",
      "Our 2016 catastrophe reinsurance program includes coverage for natural catastrophes and some coverage for terrorism events. It consists of a large North American occurrence cover (without reinstatement) to protect against large North America losses, and Japan occurrence and aggregate covers to protect against losses in Japan. The attachment point for this reinsurance program is at $3 billion for the North American cover and varies by line of business for the Japan covers.\n",
      "Actual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios. The occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors - Reserves and Exposures for additional information.\n",
      "Terrorism Risk\n",
      "We actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. We have set risk limits based on modeled losses from certain terrorism attack scenarios. Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model and various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the Non-Life Insurance Companies exposures. Examples of modeled scenarios are conventional bombs of different sizes, anthrax attacks and nuclear attacks.\n",
      "Our largest terrorism exposures are in New York City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers’ Compensation lines of business. At our largest exposure location, modeled losses for a five-ton bomb attack net of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (TRIPRA) and reinsurance recoveries are estimated to be $3 billion as of September 30, 2015. We also have smaller terrorism exposure in Canadian cities and in London.\n",
      "Our exposure to terrorism risk is mitigated by TRIPRA in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIPRA covers terrorist attacks within the United States or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law. In 2016, TRIPRA covers 84 percent of insured losses above a deductible, decreasing by one percent each year to 80 percent in 2020. The current estimate of our deductible is approximately $2.7 billion for 2015.\n",
      "We offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks.\n",
      "Mortgage Risk\n",
      "For Mortgage Guaranty, the potential exposure to loss is due to borrower default on a first-lien residential mortgage; the primary drivers of this risk are changes in mortgage underwriting standards, home price depreciation, changes in the unemployment rate, changes in mortgage rates, and mortgagee behavior.\n",
      "Mortgage Guaranty manages the quality of the loans it insures through use of a proprietary risk quality index. Mortgage Guaranty uses this index to determine an insurability threshold as well as to manage the risk distribution of its new business. Along with traditional mortgage underwriting variables, Mortgage Guaranty’s risk-based pricing model uses rating factors such as local housing economic conditions to establish premium rates.\n",
      "Reinsurance Recoverable\n",
      "AIG’s reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of:\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "• Paid losses recoverable - balances due from reinsurers for losses and loss adjustment expenses paid by our subsidiaries and billed, but not yet collected.\n",
      "• Ceded loss reserves - ultimate ceded reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, including reserves for claims reported but not yet paid and estimates for IBNR.\n",
      "• Ceded reserves for unearned premiums.\n",
      "At December 31, 2015, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $20.4 billion. These assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $1.2 billion, ceded loss reserves of $14.5 billion including reserves for IBNR, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $3.0 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverables of $1.7 billion. The methods used to estimate IBNR and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. These methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments are reflected in income. We believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at December 31, 2015 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. Actual losses may, however, differ, perhaps materially, from the reserves currently ceded.\n",
      "The Reinsurance Credit Department (RCD) conducts periodic detailed assessments of the financial strength and condition of current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic. The RCD monitors both the financial condition of reinsurers as well as the total reinsurance recoverable ceded to reinsurers, and set limits with regard to the amount and type or exposure we are willing to take with reinsurers. As part of these assessments, we attempt to identify whether a reinsurer is appropriately licensed, assess its financial capacity and liquidity; and evaluate the local economic and financial environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates. The RCD reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for measures, including collateral to mitigate credit risk. For example, in our treaty reinsurance contracts, we frequently include provisions that allow us to require a reinsurer to post collateral or use other measures to reduce exposure when a referenced event occurs. Furthermore, we limit our unsecured exposure to reinsurers through the use of credit triggers such as insurer financial strength rating downgrades, declines in regulatory capital, or specified declines in risk-based capital (RBC) ratios. We also set maximum limits for reinsurance recoverable exposure, which in some cases is the recoverable amount plus an estimate of the maximum potential exposure from unexpected events for a reinsurer. In addition, credit executives within ERM review reinsurer exposures and credit limits and approve reinsurer credit limits above specified levels. Finally, even where we conclude that uncollateralized credit risk is acceptable, we require collateral from active reinsurance counterparties where it is necessary for our subsidiaries to recognize the reinsurance recoverable assets for statutory accounting purposes. At December 31, 2015, we held $7.4 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers. We believe that no exposure to a single reinsurer represents an inappropriate concentration of risk to us, nor is our business substantially dependent upon any single reinsurance contract.\n",
      "The following table presents information for each reinsurer representing in excess of five percent of our total reinsurance recoverable assets:\n",
      "(a) The financial strength ratings reflect the ratings of the various reinsurance subsidiaries of the companies listed as of February 5, 2016.\n",
      "(b) Total reinsurance assets include both the Non-Life Insurance Companies and the Life Insurance Companies reinsurance recoverable.\n",
      "(c) Excludes collateral held in excess of applicable balances.\n",
      "(d) Includes $1.8 billion recoverable under the 2011 retroactive reinsurance transaction pursuant to which a large portion of the Non-Life Insurance Companies net domestic asbestos liabilities were transferred to NICO. Does not include reinsurance assets ceded to other reinsurers for which NICO has assumed the collection risk. See Liability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses - Transfer of Domestic Asbestos Liabilities.\n",
      "At December 31, 2015, we had no significant general reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. Reinsurer capital levels continued to increase in 2015, thereby increasing the industry’s underwriting capacity. This increased capacity has resulted in increased competition and lower rates for 2016 renewals. Reduced profitability associated with lower rates could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers.\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "The RCD, in conjunction with the credit executives within ERM, reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require the reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.\n",
      "See Item 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates - Reinsurance Assets for further discussion of reinsurance recoverable.\n",
      "Life Insurance Companies Key Insurance Risks\n",
      "Our Retirement and Life segments manage risk through product design, experience monitoring, pricing actions, risk limitations, reinsurance and active monitoring and management of the relationships between assets and liabilities, including hedging.\n",
      "For our Retirement and Life products offered by the Life Insurance Companies, key insurance risks include the following:\n",
      "• Mortality risk - represents the risk of loss arising from actual mortality rates being higher than expected mortality rates. This risk could arise from pandemics or other events, including longer-term societal changes that cause higher than expected mortality. This risk exists in a number of our product lines, but is most significant for our life insurance products.\n",
      "• Longevity risk - represents the risk of a change in value of a policy or benefit as a result of actual mortality rates being lower than the expected mortality rates. This risk could arise from longer-term societal health changes as well as other factors. This risk exists in a number of our product lines but is most significant for our retirement, institutional and annuity products.\n",
      "• Policyholder behavior risk including surrender/lapse risk - represents the risk that actual policyholder behavior differs from expected behavior in a manner that has an adverse effect on our results of operations. There are many assumptions made when products are sold, including how long the contracts will persist. Actual experience can vary significantly from these assumptions. This risk is impacted by a number of factors including changes in market conditions, especially interest rate and equity market changes, tax law, regulations and policyholder preferences. This risk exists in the majority of our product lines.\n",
      "• Interest rate risk - represents the potential for loss due to a change in interest rates. Interest rate risk is measured with respect to assets, liabilities (both insurance-related and financial) and derivatives. This risk manifests itself when interest rates move significantly in a short period of time. Rapidly rising interest rates create the potential for increased surrenders. Interest rate risk can also manifest itself over a longer period of time, such as in a persistent low interest rate environment. Low long-term interest rates put pressure on investment returns, which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products.\n",
      "• Equity risk - represents the potential for loss due to changes in equity prices. It affects equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities (and associated guaranteed living and death benefits, as discussed below), universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance. In addition, changes in the volatility of equity prices can affect the valuation of insurance features that are accounted for as embedded derivatives and the related economic hedges.\n",
      "The emergence of significant adverse experience compared to the initial assumptions at policy issuance or updated assumption would require an adjustment to DAC and benefit reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for a particular period. For additional discussion of the impact of actual and expected experience on DAC and benefit reserves, see Critical Accounting Estimates - Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health (Life Insurance Companies) and Critical Accounting Estimates - Guaranteed Benefit Features of Variable Annuity Products (Life Insurance Companies). For additional discussion of business risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Business and Operations.\n",
      "Variable Annuity Risk Management and Hedging Program\n",
      "Our Retirement Income Solutions and Group Retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with riders that guarantee a certain level of benefits. Certain guaranteed living benefits, which include GMWB and GMAB, are accounted for as\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses). GMWB and GMAB features subject the Life Insurance Companies to market risk, including exposure to changes in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility.\n",
      "Variable annuity product design is the first step in managing our exposure to these market risks. Risk mitigation features of our variable annuity product design include GMWB rider fees indexed to an equity market volatility index, which can provide additional fee assessments in periods of market volatility, required minimum allocations to fixed accounts to reduce overall equity exposure, and the utilization of volatility control funds, which reduce equity exposure in the funds in response to changes in market volatility, even under sudden or extreme market movements.\n",
      "After reflecting our product risk-mitigating features, we hedge our remaining economic exposure to market risk within GMWB and GMAB features through our variable annuity hedging program, which is designed to offset certain changes in the economic value of these GMWB and GMAB embedded derivatives, within established thresholds. The hedging program is designed to provide additional protection against large and combined movements in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility under multiple scenarios.\n",
      "Our hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents our estimate of the underlying economic drivers of these embedded derivatives, based on the present value of the future expected benefit payments for the GMWB and GMAB, less the present value of future rider fees, over numerous stochastic scenarios. This stochastic projection method uses best estimate assumptions for policyholder behavior (including mortality, lapses, withdrawals and benefit utilization) in conjunction with market scenarios calibrated to observable equity and interest rate option prices. Policyholder behaviors are regularly evaluated to compare current assumptions to actual experience and, if appropriate, changes are made to the policyholder behavior assumptions. The risk of changes in policyholder behavior is not explicitly hedged and such differences between expected and actual policyholder behaviors may result in hedge ineffectiveness.\n",
      "Due to differences between the calculation of the economic hedge target and U.S. GAAP valuation of the embedded derivative, which include differences in the treatment of rider fees and exclusion of certain risk margins and other differences in discount rates, we expect relative movements in the economic hedge target and the U.S. GAAP embedded derivative valuation will vary over time with changes in equity markets, interest rates and credit spreads. See Results of Operations - Life Insurance Companies DAC and Reserves - Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefit Features and Hedging Program for information on the impact on our consolidated pre-tax income from the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives and the hedging portfolio, as well as additional discussion of differences between the economic hedge target and the valuation of the embedded derivatives.\n",
      "In designing our hedging portfolio, we make assumptions and projections about the future performance of the underlying contract holder funds. To project future account value changes, we make assumptions about how each of the underlying funds will perform. We map the contract holder funds to a set of publicly traded indices that we believe best represent the liability to be hedged. Basis risk exists due to the variance between these assumptions and actual fund returns, which may result in variances between changes in the hedging portfolio and changes in the economic hedge target. Net hedge results and the cost of hedging are also impacted by differences between realized volatility and implied volatility.\n",
      "To manage the capital market exposures embedded within the economic hedge target, we identify and hedge market sensitivities to changes in equity markets, interest rates, volatility and credit spreads. The hedge program purchases derivative instruments or securities having sensitivities that offset those in the economic hedge target, within internally defined threshold levels. Since the relative movements of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target vary over time or with market changes, the net exposure can be outside the threshold limits, and adjustments to the hedging portfolio are made periodically to return the net exposure to within threshold limits.\n",
      "Our hedging program utilizes various derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts, interest rate swaps and swaption contracts, as well as other hedging instruments. In addition, we purchase certain fixed income securities and elect the fair value option as a capital efficient way to manage interest rate and credit spread exposures. To minimize counterparty credit risk, the majority of our derivative instrument hedges are implemented using exchange-traded futures and options, cleared through global exchanges. Over the counter derivatives are highly collateralized.\n",
      "The hedging program is monitored on a daily basis to ensure that the economic hedge target and derivative portfolio are within the threshold limits, pursuant to the approved hedge strategy. Daily risk monitoring verifies that the net risk exposures, as measured through sensitivities to a large set of market shocks, are within the approved net risk exposure threshold limits. In addition, monthly stress tests are performed to determine the program’s effectiveness relative to the applicable limits, under an\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "array of combined severe market stresses in equity prices, interest rates, volatility and credit spreads. Finally, hedge strategies are reviewed regularly to gauge their effectiveness in managing our market exposures in the context of our overall risk appetite.\n",
      "Other Operations Risks\n",
      "Derivative Transactions\n",
      "We utilize derivatives principally to enable us to hedge exposure to interest rates, currencies, credit, commodities, equities and other risks. Credit risk associated with derivative counterparties exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to us. The maximum potential exposure will increase or decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions. All derivative transactions must be transacted within counterparty limits that have been approved by ERM.\n",
      "We evaluate counterparty credit quality by internal analysis consistent with the AIG Credit Policy. We utilize various credit enhancements, including letters of credit, guarantees, collateral, credit triggers, credit derivatives, margin agreements and subordination to reduce the credit risk relating to outstanding financial derivative transactions. We require credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties, and transaction size and maturity. Furthermore, we enter into certain agreements that have the benefit of set-off and close-out netting provisions, such as ISDA Master Agreements. These provisions provide that, in the case of an early termination of a transaction, we can set off receivables from a counterparty against payables to the same counterparty arising out of all covered transactions.

      "Overview of Loss Reserving Process and Methods\n",
      "The Non-Life Insurance Companies’ loss reserves can generally be categorized into two distinct groups. Short-tail classes of business consist principally of property, Personal Insurance and certain casualty classes. Long-tail casualty classes of business include excess and umbrella liability, D&O, professional liability, medical malpractice, workers’ compensation, general liability, products liability and related classes.\n",
      "Short-Tail Reserves\n",
      "For operations writing short-tail coverages, where the nature of claims is low frequency and high severity such as property, the process for recording non-catastrophe quarterly loss reserves for more recent accident quarters is geared toward maintaining incurred but not reported reserves (IBNR) based on percentages of net earned premiums for that business, rather than projecting ultimate loss ratios based on reported losses. For example, the IBNR reserve required for the latest accident quarter for a class of property business might be approximately 20 percent of the quarter’s earned premiums. This level of reserve would generally be recorded regardless of the actual losses reported in the current quarter. The percent of premium factor reflects both our expectation of the ultimate loss costs associated with the class of business and the expectation of the percentage of ultimate loss costs that have not yet been reported. The expected ultimate loss costs generally reflect the average loss costs from a period of preceding accident quarters that have been adjusted for changes in rate and loss cost levels, mix of business, known exposure to unreported losses, or other factors affecting the particular class of business. The expected percentage of ultimate loss costs that have not yet been reported would be derived from historical loss emergence patterns. For more mature quarters, loss development methods would be used to determine the IBNR. For other classes where the nature of claims is high frequency low severity, methods including loss development, frequency/severity or a multiple of average monthly losses may be used to determine IBNR reserves. IBNR for claims arising from catastrophic events or events of unusual severity would be determined in close collaboration with the claims department, using alternative techniques or expected percentages of ultimate loss cost emergence based on historical loss emergence of similar claim types.\n",

      "Long-Tail Reserves\n",
      "Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss adjustment expenses (net losses) for long-tail casualty classes of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the class and volume of business, as well as estimates of the reinsurance recoverable. Experience in the more recent accident years shows limited statistical credibility in reported net losses on long-tail casualty classes of business. That is because a relatively low proportion of net incurred losses represents reported claims and expenses, and an even smaller percentage represents net losses paid. Therefore, IBNR constitutes a relatively high proportion of net losses.\n",

      "To estimate net losses for long-tail casualty classes of business, we use a variety of actuarial methods and assumptions and other analytical techniques as described below. A detailed reserve review is generally performed at least once per year to allow for comprehensive actuarial evaluation and collaboration with claims, underwriting, business unit management, risk management and senior management.\n",
      "We generally make a number of actuarial assumptions in the review of reserves for each class of business.\n",
      "We record quarterly changes in loss reserves for each of the Non-Life Insurance Companies classes of business. The overall change in our loss reserves is based on the sum of the changes for all classes of business. For most long-tail classes of business, the quarterly loss reserve changes are based on the estimated current loss ratio for each class of coverage less any amounts paid. Also, any change in estimated ultimate losses from prior accident years deemed to be necessary based on the results of our latest reserve studies or large loss analysis, either positive or negative, is reflected in the loss reserve for the current quarter. Differences between actual loss emergence in a given period compared to our expectations may also influence our judgment with respect to reserve adequacy.\n",
      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "Details of the Loss Reserving Process\n",
      "The process of determining the current loss ratio for each class of business is based on a variety of factors. These include considerations such as: prior accident year and policy year loss ratios; rate changes; and changes in coverage, reinsurance, or mix of business. Other considerations include actual and anticipated changes in external factors such as trends in loss costs, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, inflation, employment rates or unemployment duration, stock market volatility, corporate bond spreads, or in the legal and claims environment. The current loss ratio for each class of business is intended to represent our best estimate of the current loss ratio after reflecting all of the relevant factors. At the close of each quarter, the assumptions underlying the loss ratios are reviewed to determine if the loss ratios remain appropriate. This process includes a review of the actual claims experience in the quarter, actual rate changes achieved, actual changes in coverage, reinsurance or mix of business, and changes in other factors that may affect the loss ratio. When this review suggests that the initially determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate, the loss ratio for current business is changed to reflect the revised assumptions.\n",
      "We conduct a comprehensive loss reserve review at least annually for each class of business in accordance with Actuarial Standards of Practice. These standards provide that the unpaid claim estimate may be presented in a variety of ways, such as a point estimate, a range of estimates, a point estimate based on the expected value of several reasonable estimates, or a probability distribution of the unpaid claim amount. Further, the actuarial central estimate represents an expected value using the range of reasonably possible outcomes.\n",
      "The reserve analysis for each class of business is performed by the actuarial personnel who are most familiar with that class of business. In this process, the actuaries are required to make numerous assumptions, including the selection of loss development factors and loss cost trend factors. They are also required to determine and select the most appropriate actuarial methods for each business class. Additionally, they must determine the segmentation of data that will enable the most suitable test of reserve adequacy. In the course of these detailed reserve reviews an actuarial central estimate of the loss reserve is determined. The sum of these central estimates for each class of business provides an overall actuarial central estimate of the loss reserve for that class.\n",
      "We selected our central estimate based on point estimates from each method with weights that vary by accident year. In 2015, we began developing our ranges of reasonable estimates for certain classes by evaluating ranges derived from multiple methodologies. We considered the range of reasonable parameter selections (for example, three-year versus ten-year average loss development factors) for each appropriate method and calculated a range of indications for each method. Where we have ranges, we assess the position of the actuarial central estimate in the range to help inform management’s decision making. The range of reasonable estimates are not intended to cover all possibilities or extreme values.\n",
      "We continue to consult with third party environmental litigation and engineering specialists, third party toxic tort claims professionals, third party clinical and public health specialists, third party workers’ compensation claims adjusters and third party actuarial advisors to help inform our judgments. In 2015, the third party actuarial reviews covered the majority of net reserves held for our Commercial long-tail classes of business, and run-off portfolios reported in Corporate and Other.\n",
      "A critical component of our detailed valuation reviews is our peer review of our reserving analyses and conclusions, where actuaries independent of the initial review evaluate the reasonableness of assumptions used, methods selected and weightings given to different methods. In addition, each detailed valuation review is subjected to a challenge process by specialists in our Enterprise Risk Management group.\n",

      "Loss reserve development can also be affected by commutations of assumed and ceded reinsurance agreements.\n",
      "Actuarial and Other Methods for Major Classes of Business\n",
      "In testing the reserves for each class of business, our actuaries determine the most appropriate actuarial methods. This determination is based on a variety of factors including the nature of the claims associated with the class of business, such as the frequency or severity of the claims. Other considerations include the loss development characteristics associated with the claims, the volume of claim data available for the applicable class, and the applicability of various actuarial methods to the class. In addition to determining the actuarial methods, the actuaries determine the appropriate loss reserve groupings of data. For example, we write many unique subclasses of professional liability. For pricing or other purposes, it is appropriate to evaluate the profitability of each subclass individually. However, for purposes of estimating the loss reserves for many classes of business, we believe it is appropriate to combine the subclasses into larger groups to produce a greater degree of credibility in the claims experience. This determination of data segmentation and actuarial methods is carefully considered for each class of business. The segmentation and actuarial methods chosen are those which together are expected to produce the most robust central estimate of the loss reserves.\n",
      "The actuarial methods we use for most long-tail casualty classes of business include loss development methods, expected loss ratio methods, including “Bornhuetter Ferguson” methods described below, and frequency/severity models. Loss development methods utilize the actual loss development patterns from prior accident years to project the reported losses to an ultimate basis for subsequent accident years. Loss development methods generally are most appropriate for classes of business which exhibit a stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next, and for which the components of the classes have similar development characteristics. For example, property exposures would generally not be combined into the same class as casualty exposures, and primary casualty exposures would generally not be combined into the same class as excess casualty exposures. In 2015, we continued to refine our loss reserving techniques for the domestic primary casualty classes of business and adopted further segmentations based on our analysis of the differing emerging loss patterns for certain classes of insureds. We generally use expected loss ratio methods in cases where the reported loss data lacks sufficient credibility to utilize loss development methods, such as for new classes of business or for long-tail classes at early stages of loss development. Frequency/severity models may be used where sufficient frequency counts are available to apply such approaches.\n",
      "Expected loss ratio methods rely on the application of an expected loss ratio to the earned premium for the class of business to determine the loss reserves. For example, an expected loss ratio of 70 percent applied to an earned premium base of $10 million for a class of business would generate an ultimate loss estimate of $7 million. Subtracting any reported paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve for this class. Under the “Bornhuetter Ferguson” methods, the expected loss ratio is applied only to the expected unreported portion of the losses. For example, for a\n",
      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "long-tail class of business for which only 10 percent of the losses are expected to be reported at the end of the accident year, the expected loss ratio would be applied to the 90 percent of the losses still unreported. The actual reported losses at the end of the accident year would be added to determine the total ultimate loss estimate for the accident year. Subtracting the reported paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve. In the example above, the expected loss ratio of 70 percent would be multiplied by 90 percent. The result of 63 percent would be applied to the earned premium of $10 million resulting in an estimated unreported loss of $6.3 million. Actual reported losses would be added to arrive at the total ultimate losses. If the reported losses were $1 million, the ultimate loss estimate under the “Bornhuetter Ferguson” method would be $7.3 million versus the $7 million amount under the expected loss ratio method described above. Thus, the “Bornhuetter Ferguson” method gives partial credibility to the actual loss experience to date for the class of business. Loss development methods generally give full credibility to the reported loss experience to date. In the example above, loss development methods would typically indicate an ultimate loss estimate of $10 million, as the reported losses of $1 million would be estimated to reflect only 10 percent of the ultimate losses.\n",
      "A key advantage of loss development methods is that they respond more quickly to any actual changes in loss costs for the class of business. Therefore, if loss experience is unexpectedly deteriorating or improving, the loss development method gives full credibility to the changing experience. Expected loss ratio methods would be slower to respond to the change, as they would continue to give more weight to the expected loss ratio, until enough evidence emerged to modify the expected loss ratio to reflect the changing loss experience. On the other hand, loss development methods have the disadvantage of overreacting to changes in reported losses if the loss experience is not credible. For example, the presence or absence of large losses at the early stages of loss development could cause the loss development method to overreact to the favorable or unfavorable experience by assuming it will continue at later stages of development. In these instances, expected loss ratio methods such as “Bornhuetter Ferguson” have the advantage of recognizing large losses without extrapolating unusual large loss activity onto the unreported portion of the losses for the accident year.\n",
      "Frequency/severity methods generally rely on the determination of an ultimate number of claims and an average severity for each claim for each accident year. Multiplying the estimated ultimate number of claims for each accident year by the expected average severity of each claim produces the estimated ultimate loss for the accident year. Frequency/severity methods generally require a sufficient volume of claims in order for the average severity to be predictable. Average severity for subsequent accident years is generally determined by applying an estimated annual loss cost trend to the estimated average claim severity from prior accident years. In certain cases, a structural approach may also be used to predict the ultimate loss cost. Frequency/severity methods have the advantage that ultimate claim counts can generally be estimated more quickly and accurately than can ultimate losses. Thus, if the average claim severity can be accurately estimated, these methods can more quickly respond to changes in loss experience than other methods. However, for average severity to be predictable, the class of business must consist of homogeneous types of claims for which loss severity trends from one year to the next are reasonably consistent. Generally these methods work best for high frequency, low severity classes of business such as personal auto.\n",
      "Structural drivers analytics seek to explain the underlying drivers of frequency/severity. A structural drivers analysis of frequency/severity is particularly useful for understanding the key drivers of uncertainty in the ultimate loss cost. For example, for the excess workers’ compensation class of business, we have attempted to corroborate our judgment by considering the impact on severity of the future propensity for deterioration of an injured worker’s medical condition, the impact of price inflation on the various categories of medical expense and cost of living adjustments on indemnity benefits, the impact of injured worker mortality and claim specific settlement and loss mitigation strategies, etc., using the following:\n",
      "• Claim by claim reviews to determine the stability and likelihood of settling an injured worker’s indemnity and medical benefits - the claim file review was facilitated by third party specialists experienced in workers’ compensation claims;\n",
      "• Analysis of the potential for future deterioration in medical condition unlikely to be picked up by a claim file review and associated with potentially costly medical procedures (i.e., increases in both utilization and intensity of medical care) over the course of the injured worker’s lifetime;\n",
      "• Analysis of the cost of medical price inflation for each category of medical spend (services and devices) and for cost of living adjustments in line with statutory requirements;\n",
      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "• Portfolio specific mortality level and mortality improvement assumptions based on a mortality study conducted for AIG’s primary and excess workers’ compensation portfolios and AIG’s opinion of future longevity trends for the open reported cases;\n",
      "• Ground-up consideration of the reinsurance recoveries expected for the class of business for reported claims with extrapolation for unreported claims; and\n",
      "• The effects of various run-off claims management strategies that have been developed by AIG’s run-off unit.\n",
      "During 2015, we continued to expand our analysis of structural drivers as a means of corroborating our judgments using traditional actuarial techniques. For example, we have considered the impact of changes in economic activity (real GDP growth, which can impact levels of trucking activity) on our emerging experience in the Commercial Auto Liability class of business, particularly business written in excess of a large insured deductible where ground up experience may take several years to reach our layer. Further, we considered the impact of expected levels of future inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Deflator (Health Services Component) published by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis on our ultimate loss costs for medical benefits in the primary workers’ compensation class of business. We believe the PCE Deflator provides a more appropriate measure of workers’ compensation medical inflation as it includes medical expenditures made by employers on behalf of their employees. We also tested the sensitivity of our estimates to changes in the future path and level of inflation for this class of business.\n",
      "Overall, our loss reserve reviews for long-tail classes typically utilize a combination of both loss development and expected loss ratio methods, supplemented by structural drivers analysis of frequency/severity where available. Loss development methods are generally given more weight for accident years and classes of business where the loss experience is highly credible. Expected loss ratio methods are given more weight where the reported loss experience is less credible, or is driven more by large losses. Expected loss ratio methods require sufficient information to determine the appropriate expected loss ratio. This information generally includes the actual loss ratios for prior accident years, and rate changes as well as underwriting or other changes which would affect the loss ratio. Further, an estimate of the loss cost trend or loss ratio trend is required to allow for the effect of inflation and other factors which may increase or otherwise change the loss costs from one accident year to the next.\n",
      "The estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims. This is due to inconsistent court decisions, as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies or have expanded theories of liability. In addition, reinsurance recoverable balances relating to asbestos and environmental loss reserves are subject to greater uncertainty due to the underlying age of the claim, underlying legal issues surrounding the nature of the coverage, and determination of proper policy period. For these reasons, these balances tend to be subject to increased levels of disputes and legal collection activity when actually billed. The insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures.\n",
      "We continue to receive claims asserting injuries and damages from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged claims to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites, referred to collectively as environmental claims, and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos.

      "Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a subjective process. Reserves for asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated using conventional reserving techniques such as those that rely on historical accident year loss development factors. The methods used to determine asbestos and environmental loss estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated by management.\n",
      "Various factors contribute to the complexity and difficulty in determining the future development of claims. Significant factors that influence the claims estimation process include court resolutions and judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage. The current case law can be characterized as still evolving, and there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop in the near future. Additionally, the exposures for cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites involve issues such as allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and the government’s refusal to release parties from liability. Future claims development also will be affected by the changes in Superfund and waste dump site coverage and liability issues.\n",
      "If the asbestos and environmental reserves develop adversely, resulting deficiencies could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations for an individual reporting period.\n",
      "With respect to known environmental claims, over two decades ago we established a specialized environmental claims unit, which investigates and adjusts all such environmental claims. This unit evaluates environmental claims utilizing a claim-by-claim approach that involves a detailed review of individual policy terms and exposures. Because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, we generally evaluate exposure on a policy-by-policy basis, considering a variety of factors such as known facts, current law, jurisdiction, policy language and other factors that are unique to each policy. Quantitative techniques must be supplemented by subjective considerations, including management judgment. Each claim is reviewed at least semi-annually utilizing the aforementioned approach and adjusted as necessary to reflect the current information.\n",
      "The environmental claims unit also actively manages and pursues early resolution with respect to these claims in an attempt to mitigate our exposure to the unpredictable development of these claims. We attempt to mitigate our known long-tail environmental exposures through a combination of proactive claim-resolution techniques, including policy buybacks, complete environmental releases, compromise settlements, and, when appropriate, litigation.\n",

      "Two of our most significant assumptions in loss-based methodologies are those for loss cost trends and loss development factors. There is generally some potential for deviation from our selected best estimate assumptions related to loss cost trends and loss development factor assumptions. The classes noted below are considered to have a higher sensitivity to changes in these assumptions than other classes. For example, primary auto liability reserves were impacted by changes in the frequency and severity of losses in recent years which may not be captured by sensitivities of the parameter modeled below.\n",
      "The sensitivity analysis below addresses each major class of business for which there is a possibility of a material deviation from our overall reserve position as a result of changes in these individual assumptions. The analysis uses a range of potential alternative assumptions for each class based on historical experience. Actual reserve development may not be consistent with either the original or the alternative loss trend or loss development factor assumptions, and other assumptions made in the reserving process may materially affect reserve development for a particular class of business.\n",
      "It should be noted that there are many other assumptions used in the loss reserving process, and the sensitivities shown below are not intended to be indications of possible loss reserve ranges for the class but merely illustrations of the sensitivity of the reserves to certain alternative assumptions considered individually. The actual reserve range is a function of many factors interacting with each other.\n",

The impacts cited below are only for the years for which we used an expected loss ratio approach. Actual loss cost trends in the early 1990s were negative for several years whereas actual loss cost trends exceeded the figures cited below for 1997 through 2001. These observed variations were considered in establishing the percentage deviations, and result in asymmetrical selections. Loss trends may deviate by more than the amounts noted above and discussed below.\n",

Using the reserving methodologies described above, our actuaries determine their actuarial central estimates of the loss reserves and advise management on their final recommendation for management’s best estimate of the recorded reserves. Subject matter experts from underwriting and claims play an important part in informing the actuarial assumptions and methods. The governance process over the establishment of loss reserves also ensures robust considerations of the changes in the loss trends, terms and conditions, claims handling practices, and large loss impact when determining the methods, assumptions and the estimations. This multi-disciplinary process engages underwriting, claims, risk management, business unit executives and senior management and involves several iterative levels of feedback and response during the regular reserving process.\n",

      "Reinsurance Assets\n",
      "The estimation of reinsurance recoverable involves a significant amount of judgment, particularly for latent exposures, such as asbestos, due to their long-tail nature. Reinsurance assets include reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses that are estimated as part of our loss reserving process and, consequently, are subject to similar judgments and uncertainties as the estimation of gross loss reserves.\n",
      "We assess the collectability of reinsurance recoverable balances through either detailed reviews of the underlying nature of the reinsurance balance or comparisons with historical trends of disputes and credit events. We record adjustments to reflect the results of these assessments through an allowance for uncollectable reinsurance that reduces the carrying amount of reinsurance assets in the balance sheet. This estimate requires significant judgment for which key considerations include:\n",
      "• paid and unpaid amounts recoverable;\n",
      "• whether the balance is in dispute or subject to legal collection;\n",
      "• whether the reinsurer is financially troubled (i.e., liquidated, insolvent, in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction); and\n",
      "• whether collateral and collateral arrangements exist.\n",
      "At December 31, 2015, the allowance for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance was $272 million.\n",
      "See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on reinsurance.\n",
      "Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health Insurance Contracts (Life Insurance Companies)\n",
      "Long-duration traditional products include whole life insurance, term life insurance, accident and health insurance, long-term care insurance, and certain payout annuities for which the payment period is life-contingent, which include certain of our single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements.\n",
      "For long-duration traditional business, a “lock-in” principle applies. The assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. The assumptions include mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses, and investment returns. These assumptions are typically consistent with pricing inputs. The assumptions also include margins for adverse deviation, principally for key assumptions such as mortality and interest rates used to discount cash flows, to reflect uncertainty given that actual experience might deviate from these assumptions. Establishing margins at contract inception requires management judgment. The extent of the margin for adverse deviation may vary depending on the uncertainty of the cash flows, which is affected by the volatility of the business and the extent of our experience with the product.\n",
      "Loss recognition occurs if observed changes in actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses under loss recognition testing. To determine whether loss recognition exists, we determine whether a future loss is expected based on updated current assumptions. If loss recognition exists, we recognize the loss by first reducing DAC through amortization expense, and, if DAC is depleted, record additional liabilities through a charge to policyholder benefit expense. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on loss recognition. Because of the long-term nature of many of our liabilities subject to the “lock-in” principle, small changes in certain assumptions may cause large changes in the degree of reserve adequacy. In particular, changes in estimates of future invested asset returns have a large effect on the degree of reserve deficiency.\n",
      "Groupings for loss recognition testing are consistent with our manner of acquiring, servicing, and measuring the profitability of the business and applied by product groupings. We perform separate loss recognition tests for traditional life products, payout annuities, and long-term care insurance. Once loss recognition has been recorded for a block of business, the old assumption set is replaced and the assumption set used for the loss recognition would then be subject to the lock-in principle. Key judgments made in loss recognition testing include the following:\n",
      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "• To determine investment returns used in loss recognition tests, we typically segregate assets that match the duration of our liabilities with assets of comparable duration, to the extent practicable, and then project future cash flows on those assets. Assets supporting insurance liabilities are primarily comprised of a diversified portfolio of high quality fixed maturity securities, and may also include, to a lesser extent, alternative investments. Our projections include a reasonable allowance for investment expenses and expected credit losses over the projection horizon. A critical assumption in the projection of expected investment income is the assumed net rate of investment return at which excess cash flows are to be reinvested. For products in which asset and liability durations are matched relatively well, this is less of a consideration since interest on excess cash flows are not a significant component of future cash flows. For the reinvestment rate assumption, anticipated future changes to the yield curves could have a large effect. Given the interest rate environment applicable at the date of our most recent loss recognition tests, we assumed a modest and gradual increase in long-term interest rates over time.\n",
      "• For mortality assumptions, key judgments include the extent of industry versus own experience to base future assumptions as well as the extent of expected mortality improvements in the future. The latter judgment is based on a combination of historical mortality trends and advice from industry, public health and demography specialists that were consulted by AIG’s actuaries and published industry information.\n",
      "• For surrender rates, a key judgment involves the correlation between expected increases/decreases in interest rates and increases/decreases in surrender rates. To support this judgment, we compare crediting rates on our products relative to expected rates on competing products under different interest rate scenarios.\n",
      "• For in-force long-term care insurance, rate increases are allowed but must be approved by state insurance regulators. Consequently, the extent of rate increases that may be assumed requires judgment. In establishing our assumption for rate increases for long-term care insurance, we consider historical experience as to the frequency and level of rate increases approved by state regulators.\n",
      "The Life operating segment recorded loss recognition expense of $28 million in 2015 and $87 million in 2014 to increase reserves for certain discontinued long-term care business due to the update of actuarial assumptions, primarily a result of lower future premium increase assumptions and, in 2014, lower yield assumptions. Sales of investment securities in connection with our program to utilize capital loss carryforwards and other investment sales with subsequent reinvestment at lower yields triggered recording of loss recognition expense of $30 million and $1.5 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily related to certain long-term payout annuity contracts in the Institutional Markets and Retirement operating segments.\n",
      "Significant unrealized appreciation on investments in a prolonged low interest rate environment may cause DAC to be adjusted and additional future policy benefit liabilities to be recorded through a charge directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (“shadow loss recognition”). These charges are included, net of tax, with the change in net unrealized appreciation of investments. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on shadow loss recognition. In applying shadow loss recognition, the Company overlays unrealized gains onto loss recognition tests without revising the underlying test. Accordingly, there is limited additional judgment in this process.\n",
      "Guaranteed Benefit Features of Variable Annuity Products (Life Insurance Companies)\n",
      "Variable annuity products offered by our Retirement Income Solutions and Group Retirement product lines offer guaranteed benefit features. These guaranteed features include guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) that are payable in the event of death or other instances, and living benefits that are payable in the event of annuitization, or, in other instances, at specified dates during the accumulation period. Living benefits include guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB), guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB), and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (GMAB). See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these features.\n",
      "The liabilities for GMDB and GMIB, which are recorded in Future policyholder benefits, represent the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account value, with the excess recognized ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected fee assessments, through Policyholder benefits and losses incurred. The liabilities for GMWB and GMAB, which are recorded in Policyholder contract deposits, are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value of the liabilities recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses).\n",
      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "Our exposure to the guaranteed amounts is equal to the amount by which the contract holder’s account balance is below the amount provided by the guaranteed feature. A variable annuity contract may include more than one type of guaranteed benefit feature; for example, it may have both a GMDB and a GMWB. However, a policyholder can generally only receive payout from one guaranteed feature on a contract containing a death benefit and a living benefit, i.e. the features are mutually exclusive, so the exposure to the guaranteed amount for each feature is independent of the exposure from other features (except a surviving spouse who has a rider to potentially collect both a GMDB upon their spouse’s death and a GMWB during their lifetime). A policyholder cannot purchase more than one living benefit on one contract. Declines in the equity markets, increased volatility and a sustained low interest rate environment increase our exposure to potential benefits under the guaranteed features, leading to an increase in the liabilities for those benefits. See Estimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products (Life Insurance) below for sensitivity analysis which includes the sensitivity of reserves for guaranteed benefit features to changes in the assumptions for interest rates, equity market returns, volatility, and mortality. For additional discussion of market risk management related to these product features, see Enterprise Risk Management - Life Insurance Companies Key Insurance Risks - Variable Annuity Risk Management and Hedging Program.\n",
      "The reserving methodology and assumptions used to measure the liabilities of our two largest guaranteed benefit features are presented in the following table:\n",
      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "Estimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products (Life Insurance Companies)\n",
      "Policy acquisition costs and policy issuance costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal of existing insurance contracts related to universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) are generally deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over a period that approximates the estimated lives of the contracts, except in instances where significant negative gross profits are expected in one or more periods. Estimated gross profits include net investment income and spreads, net realized investment gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses, and mortality gains and losses. In estimating future gross profits, lapse assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on DAC amortization. For fixed deferred annuity contracts, the future spread between investment income and interest credited to policyholders is a significant judgment, particularly in a low interest rate environment.\n",
      "If the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC and related reserves, including VOBA, SIA, guaranteed benefit reserves and URR, are recalculated using the new assumptions, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. Updating such assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.\n",
      "In estimating future gross profits for variable annuity products, a long-term annual asset growth assumption of 8.5% (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected) is applied to estimate the future growth in assets and related asset-based fees. In determining the asset growth rate, the effect of short-term fluctuations in the equity markets is partially mitigated through the use of a reversion to the mean methodology, whereby short-term asset growth above or below the long-term annual rate assumption impacts the growth assumption applied to the five-year period subsequent to the current balance sheet date. The reversion to the mean methodology allows us to maintain our long-term growth assumptions, while also giving consideration to the effect of actual investment performance. When actual performance significantly deviates from the annual long-term growth assumption, as evidenced by growth assumptions for the five-year reversion to the mean period falling below a certain rate (floor) or above a certain rate (cap) for a sustained period, judgment may be applied to revise or “unlock” the growth rate assumptions to be used for both the five-year reversion to the mean period as well as the long-term annual growth assumption applied to subsequent periods. The use of a reversion to the mean assumption is common within the industry; however, the parameters used in the methodology are subject to judgment and vary within the industry. See Results of Operations - Life Insurance Companies DAC and Reserves - Reversion to the Mean for additional discussion.\n",
      "The following table summarizes the sensitivity of changes in certain assumptions for DAC and SIA, embedded derivatives and other reserves related to guaranteed benefits and URR, the related hypothetical impact on December 31, 2015 balances and the resulting hypothetical impact on pre-tax income, before hedging.

      "The analysis of DAC, embedded derivatives and other reserves related to guaranteed benefits, and unearned revenue reserve is a dynamic process that considers all relevant factors and assumptions described above. We estimate each of the above factors individually, without the effect of any correlation among the key assumptions.

The effects on pre-tax income in the sensitivity analysis table above do not reflect the related effects from our economic hedging program, which utilizes derivative and other financial instruments and is designed so that changes in value of those instruments move in the opposite direction of changes in the guaranteed benefit embedded derivative liabilities.

      "Impairments on Investments in Life Settlements\n",
      "Impairments to investments in life settlements may occur in the future due to the fact that continued payment of premiums required to maintain policies will cause the expected lifetime undiscounted cash flows for some policies to become negative in future reporting periods, even in the absence of future changes to the mortality assumptions.

      "Liability for Legal Contingencies\n",
      "We estimate and record a liability for potential losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent such losses are probable and can be estimated. Determining a reasonable estimate of the amount of such losses requires significant management judgment. In many cases, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases that are in the early stages of litigation or in which claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, we often cannot predict the outcome or estimate the eventual loss or range of reasonably possible losses related to such matters.\n",

      "- Ratios: We, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses (which for General Insurance excludes net loss reserve discount), and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. Our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under GAAP, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios.\n",

      "Overview of Loss Reserving Process and Methods\n",
      "Our loss reserves can generally be categorized into two distinct groups. Short-tail reserves consists principally of U.S. Property and Special Risks, Europe Property and Special Risks, U.S. Personal Insurance, and Europe and Japan Personal Insurance. Long-tail reserves include U.S. Workers’ Compensation, U.S. Excess Casualty, U.S. Other Casualty, U.S. Financial Lines, Europe Casualty and Financial Lines, and U.S. Run-off Long Tail Insurance Lines.\n",
      "Short-Tail Reserves\n",
      "For our short-tail coverages, such as property, where the nature of claims is generally high frequency with short reporting periods, with volatility arising from occasional severe events, the process for recording non-catastrophe quarterly loss reserves is geared toward maintaining IBNR based on percentages of net earned premiums for that business, rather than projecting ultimate loss ratios based on reported losses. For example, the IBNR reserve required for the latest accident quarter for a product line such as homeowners might be approximately 20 percent of the quarter’s earned premiums. This level of reserve would generally be recorded regardless of the actual losses reported in the current quarter, thus recognizing severe events as they occur. The percent of premium factor reflects both our expectation of the ultimate loss costs associated with the line of business and the expectation of the percentage of ultimate loss costs that have not yet been reported. The expected ultimate loss costs generally reflect the average loss costs from a period of preceding accident quarters that have been adjusted for changes in rate and loss cost levels, mix of business, known exposure to unreported losses, or other factors affecting the particular line of business. The expected percentage of ultimate loss costs that have not yet been reported would be derived from historical loss emergence patterns. For more mature quarters, specific loss development methods would be used to determine the IBNR. For other product lines where the nature of claims is high frequency but low severity, methods including loss development, frequency/severity or a multiple of average monthly losses may be used to determine IBNR reserves. IBNR for claims arising from catastrophic events or events of unusual severity would be determined in close collaboration with the claims department’s knowledge of known information, using alternative techniques or expected percentages of ultimate loss cost emergence based on historical loss emergence of similar claim types.\n",
      "Long-Tail Reserves\n",
      "Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss adjustment expenses (net losses) for our long-tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the product line and volume of business, as well as estimates of reinsurance recoveries. Experience in the more recent accident years generally provides limited statistical credibility of reported net losses on long-tail casualty lines of business. That is because in the more recent accident years, a relatively low proportion of estimated ultimate net incurred losses are reported or paid. Therefore, IBNR reserves constitute a relatively high proportion of net losses.\n",
      "For our longer-tail lines, we generally make actuarial and other assumptions with respect to the following:\n",
      "· Loss cost trend factors are used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on the projected loss ratios for prior accident years.\n",
      "· Expected loss ratios are used for the latest accident year (i.e., accident year 2017 for the year-end 2017 loss reserve analysis) and, in some cases for accident years prior to the latest accident year. The expected loss ratio generally reflects the projected loss ratio from prior accident years, adjusted for the loss cost trend and the effect of rate changes and other quantifiable factors on the loss ratio. For low-frequency, high-severity lines of business such as excess casualty, expected loss ratios generally are used for at least the three most recent accident years.\n",
      "· Loss development factors are used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate basis. Generally, the actual loss development factors observed from prior accident years would be used as a basis to determine the loss development factors for the subsequent accident years.\n",
      "· Tail factors are development factors used for certain longer tailed lines of business (for example, excess casualty, workers’ compensation and general liability),to project future loss development for periods that extend beyond the available development data. The development of losses to the ultimate loss for a given accident year for these lines may take decades and the projection of ultimate losses for an accident year is very sensitive to the tail factors selected beyond a certain age.\n",

      "We record quarterly changes in loss reserves for each product line of business. The overall change in our loss reserves is based on the sum of the changes for all product lines of business. For most long-tail product lines of business, the quarterly loss reserve changes are based on the estimated current loss ratio for each subset of coverage less any amounts paid. Also, any change in estimated ultimate losses from prior accident years deemed to be necessary based on the results of our latest detailed valuation reviews, large loss analyses, or other analytical techniques, either positive or negative, is reflected in the loss reserve and incurred losses for the current quarter. Differences between actual loss emergence in a given period and our expectations based on prior loss reserve estimates are used to monitor reserve adequacy between detailed valuation reviews and may also influence our judgment with respect to adjusting reserve estimates.\n",
      "Details of the Loss Reserving Process\n",
      "The process of determining the current loss ratio for each product line of business is based on a variety of factors. These include considerations such as: prior accident year and policy year loss ratios; rate changes; and changes in coverage, reinsurance, or mix of business. Other considerations include actual and anticipated changes in external factors such as trends in loss costs, inflation, employment rates or unemployment duration or in the legal and claims environment. The current loss ratio for each product line of business is intended to represent our best estimate after reflecting all of the relevant factors. At the close of each quarter, the assumptions and data underlying the loss ratios are reviewed to determine whether the loss ratios remain appropriate. This process includes a review of the actual loss experience in the quarter, actual rate changes achieved, actual changes in reinsurance, quantifiable changes in coverage or mix of business, and changes in other factors that may affect the loss ratio. When this review suggests that the previously determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate, the loss ratio is changed to reflect the revised estimates.\n",
      "We conduct a comprehensive loss detailed valuation review at least annually for each product line of business in accordance with Actuarial Standards of Practice. These standards provide that the unpaid loss estimate may be presented in a variety of ways, such as a point estimate, a range of estimates, a point estimate based on the expected value of several reasonable estimates, or a probability distribution of the unpaid loss amount. Our actuarial best estimate for each product line of business represents an expected value generally considering a range of reasonably possible outcomes.\n",
      "The reserve analysis for each product line of business is performed by a credentialed actuarial team in collaboration with claims, underwriting, business unit management, risk management and senior management. Our actuaries consider the ongoing applicability of prior data groupings and update numerous assumptions, including the analysis and selection of loss development and loss trend factors. They also determine and select the appropriate actuarial or other methods used to estimate reserve adequacy for each business product line, and may employ multiple methods and assumptions for each product line. These data groupings, accident year weights, method selections and assumptions necessarily change over time as business mix changes, development factors mature and become more credible and loss characteristics evolve. In the course of these detailed valuation reviews an actuarial best estimate of the loss reserve is determined. The sum of these estimates for each product line of business yields an overall actuarial best estimate for that line of business.\n",
      "For certain product lines, we measure sensitivities and determine explicit ranges around the actuarial best estimate using multiple methodologies and varying assumptions. Where we have ranges, we use them to inform our selection of best estimates of loss reserves by major product line of business. Our range of reasonable estimates is not intended to cover all possibilities or extreme values and is based on known data and facts at the time of estimation.\n",
      "We consult with third party environmental litigation and engineering specialists, third party toxic tort claims professionals, third party clinical and public health specialists, third party workers’ compensation claims adjusters and third party actuarial advisors to help inform our judgments, as needed.\n",
      "A critical component of our detailed valuation reviews is an internal peer review of our reserving analyses and conclusions, where actuaries independent of the initial review evaluate the reasonableness of assumptions used, methods selected and weightings given to different methods. In addition, each detailed valuation review is subjected to a review and challenge process by specialists in our Enterprise Risk Management group.\n",

      "We consider key factors in performing detailed actuarial reviews, including:\n",
      "· an assessment of economic conditions including inflation, employment rates or unemployment duration;\n",
      "· changes in the legal, regulatory, judicial and social environment including changes in road safety, public health and cleanup standards;\n",

      "Actuarial and Other Methods for Major Lines of Business\n",
      "Our actuaries determine the appropriate actuarial methods and segmentation. This determination is based on a variety of factors including the nature of the losses associated with the product line of business, such as the frequency or severity of the claims. In addition to determining the actuarial methods, the actuaries determine the appropriate loss reserve groupings of data. This determination is a judgmental, dynamic process and refinements to the groupings are made every year. The changes to groupings may be driven by and may change to reflect observed or emerging patterns within and across product lines, or to differentiate different risk characteristics (for example, size of deductibles and extent of third party claims specialists used by our insureds). As an example of reserve segmentation, we write many unique subsets of professional liability, which cover different products, industry segments, and coverage structures. While for pricing or other purposes, it may be appropriate to evaluate the profitability of each subset individually, we believe it is appropriate to combine the subsets into larger groups for reserving purposes to produce a greater degree of credibility in the loss experience. This determination of data segmentation and related actuarial methods is assessed, reviewed and updated at least annually.\n",
      "The actuarial methods we use most commonly include paid and incurred loss development methods, expected loss ratio methods, including “Bornhuetter Ferguson” and “Cape Cod”, and frequency/severity models. Loss development methods utilize the actual loss development patterns from prior accident years updated through the current year to project the reported losses to an ultimate basis for all accident years. We also use this information to update our current accident year loss selections. Loss development methods are generally most appropriate for classes of business that exhibit a stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next, and for which the components of the product line have similar development characteristics. For example, property exposures would generally not be combined into the same product line as casualty exposures, and primary casualty exposures would generally not be combined into the same product line as excess casualty exposures. We continually refine our loss reserving techniques and adopt further segmentations based on our analysis of differing emerging loss patterns for certain product lines. We generally use expected loss ratio methods in cases where the reported loss data lacked sufficient credibility to utilize loss development methods, such as for new product lines of business or for long-tail product lines at early stages of loss development. Frequency/severity models may be used where sufficient frequency counts are available to apply such approaches.\n",
      "Expected loss ratio methods rely on the application of an expected loss ratio to the earned premium for the product line of business to determine the liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses. For example, an expected loss ratio of 70 percent applied to an earned premium base of $10 million for a product line of business would generate an ultimate loss estimate of $7 million. Subtracting any paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve for this product line. Under the Bornhuetter Ferguson methods, the expected loss ratio is applied only to the expected unreported portion of the losses. For example, for a long-tail product line of business for which only 10 percent of the losses are expected to be reported at the end of the accident year, the expected loss ratio would be used to represent the 90 percent of losses still unreported. The actual reported losses at the end of the accident year would be added to determine the total ultimate loss estimate for the accident year. Subtracting the reported paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve. In the example above, the expected loss ratio of 70 percent would be multiplied by 90 percent. The result of 63 percent would be applied to the earned premium of $10 million resulting in an estimated unreported loss of $6.3 million. Actual reported losses would be added to arrive at the total ultimate losses. If the reported losses were $1 million, the ultimate loss estimate under the Bornhuetter Ferguson method would be $7.3 million versus the $7 million amount under the expected loss ratio method described above. Thus, the Bornhuetter Ferguson method gives partial credibility to the actual loss experience to date for the product line of business. Loss development methods generally give full credibility to the reported loss experience to date. In the example above, loss development methods would typically indicate an ultimate loss estimate of $10 million, as the reported losses of $1 million would be estimated to reflect only 10 percent of the ultimate losses.\n",
      "AIG | 2017 Form 10-K 43\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Critical Accounting Estimates\n",
      "A key advantage of loss development methods is that they respond more quickly to any actual changes in loss costs for the product line of business. Therefore, if loss experience is unexpectedly deteriorating or improving, the loss development method gives full credibility to the changing experience. Expected loss ratio methods would be slower to respond to the change, as they would continue to give more weight to a prior expected loss ratio, until enough evidence emerged to modify the expected loss ratio to reflect the changing loss experience. On the other hand, loss development methods have the disadvantage of overreacting to changes in reported losses if the loss experience is anomalous due to the various key factors described above and the inherent volatility in some of the classes. For example, the presence or absence of large losses at the early stages of loss development could cause the loss development method to overreact to the favorable or unfavorable experience by assuming it is a fundamental shift in the development pattern. In these instances, expected loss ratio methods such as Bornhuetter Ferguson have the advantage of recognizing large losses without extrapolating unusual large loss activity onto the unreported portion of the losses for the accident year.\n",
      "The Cape Cod method is a hybrid between the loss development and Bornhuetter Ferguson methods, where the historic loss data and loss development factor assumptions are used to determine the expected loss ratio estimate in the Bornhuetter Ferguson method.\n",
      "Frequency/severity methods generally rely on the determination of an ultimate number of claims and an average severity for each claim for each accident year. Multiplying the estimated ultimate number of claims for each accident year by the expected average severity of each claim produces the estimated ultimate loss for the accident year. Frequency/severity methods generally require a sufficient volume of claims in order for the average severity to be predictable. Average severity for subsequent accident years is generally determined by applying an estimated annual loss cost trend to the estimated average claim severity from prior accident years. In certain cases, a structural approach may also be used to predict the ultimate loss cost. Frequency/severity methods have the advantage that ultimate claim counts can generally be estimated more quickly and accurately than can ultimate losses. Thus, if the average claim severity can be accurately estimated, these methods can more quickly respond to changes in loss experience than other methods. However, for average severity to be predictable, the product line of business must consist of homogenous types of claims for which loss severity trends from one year to the next are reasonably consistent and where there are limited changes to deductible levels or limits. Generally these methods work best for high frequency, low severity product lines of business such as personal auto. However, frequency and severity metrics are also used to test the reasonability of results for other product lines of business and provide indications of underlying trends in the data. In addition, ultimate claim counts can be used as an alternative exposure measure to earned premiums in the Cape Cod method.\n",
      "Structural driver analytics seek to explain the underlying drivers of frequency/severity. A structural driver analysis of frequency/severity is particularly useful for understanding the key drivers of uncertainty in the ultimate loss cost. For example, for the excess workers’ compensation product line of business, we have attempted to corroborate our judgment by considering the impact on severity of the future potential for deterioration of an injured worker’s medical condition, the impact of price inflation on the various categories of medical expense and cost of living adjustments on indemnity benefits, the impact of injured worker mortality and claim specific settlement and loss mitigation strategies, etc., using the following:\n",
      "• Claim by claim reviews, often facilitated by third party specialists, to determine the stability and likelihood of settling an injured worker’s indemnity and medical benefits;\n",
      "• Analysis of the potential for future deterioration in medical condition unlikely to be picked up by a claim file review and associated with potentially costly medical procedures (i.e., increases in both utilization and intensity of medical care) over the course of the injured worker’s lifetime;\n",
      "• Analysis of the cost of medical price inflation for each category of medical spend (services and devices) and for cost of living adjustments in line with statutory requirements;\n",
      "• Portfolio specific mortality level and mortality improvement assumptions based on a mortality study conducted for our primary and excess workers’ compensation portfolios and our opinion of future longevity trends for the open reported cases;\n",
      "• Ground-up consideration of the reinsurance recoveries expected for the product line of business for reported claims with extrapolation for unreported claims; and\n",

      "In recent years, we have expanded our analysis of structural drivers to additional product lines of business as a means of corroborating our judgments using traditional actuarial techniques. For example, we have explicitly used external estimates of future medical inflation and mortality in estimating the loss development tail for excess of deductible primary workers’ compensation business. Using external forecasts for items such as these can improve the accuracy and stability of our estimates.\n",
      "The estimation of liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental pollution losses on insurance policies written many years ago is typically subject to greater uncertainty than other types of losses. This is due to inconsistent court decisions, as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies or have expanded theories of liability. In addition, reinsurance recoverable balances relating to asbestos and environmental loss reserves are subject to greater uncertainty due to the underlying age of the claim, underlying legal issues surrounding the nature of the coverage, and determination of proper policy period. For these reasons, these balances tend to be subject to increased levels of disputes and legal collection activity when actually billed. The insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures.\n",
      "We continue to receive claims asserting injuries and damages from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged claims to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites, referred to collectively as environmental claims, and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. The vast majority of these asbestos and environmental losses emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained absolute exclusions for pollution-related damage and asbestos. The current environmental policies that we specifically price and underwrite for environmental risks on a claims-made basis have been excluded from the analysis.\n",
      "The majority of our exposures for asbestos and environmental losses are related to excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. The litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity amounts, with litigation expenses included within the limits of the liability we incur. Individual significant loss reserves, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case-by-case basis.\n",

      "The tail factor is typically the most critical assumption, and small changes in the selected tail factor can have a material effect on our carried reserves. For example, the tail factors beyond twenty years for guaranteed cost business could vary by one and one-half percent below to two percent above those actually indicated in the 2017 loss reserve review. For excess of deductible business, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that tail factors beyond twenty years could vary by four percent below to six percent above those actually indicated in the 2017 loss reserve review.\n",

The loss cost trend assumption is critical for the U.S. Excess Casualty class of business due to the long-tail nature of the losses, and is applied across many accident years. Thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years (the expected loss ratio years) to be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends that were initially relied upon in setting the loss reserves. These changes in loss trends could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.\n",
      "U.S. Excess Casualty is a long-tail class of business and any deviation in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. Mass tort claims in particular may develop over a very extended period and impact multiple accident years, so we usually select a separate pattern for them. Thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years to be significantly affected by changes in loss development factors that were initially relied upon in setting the reserves.\n",
      "After evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the actual loss development factors could vary by an amount equivalent to a six month shift from those actually utilized in the year-end 2017 reserve review. This would impact projections both for accident years where the selections were directly based on loss development methods as well as the a priori loss ratio assumptions for accident years with selections based on Bornhuetter-Ferguson or Cape Cod methods. Similar to loss cost trends, these changes in loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.\n",
      "U.S. Other Casualty\n",
      "The key uncertainties for other casualty lines are similar to excess casualty, as the underlying business is long-tailed and can be subject to variability in loss cost trends and changes in loss development factors. These may differ significantly by line of business as coverages such as general liability, medical malpractice and environmental may be subject to different risk drivers.\n",
      "U.S. Financial Lines\n",
      "The loss cost trends for U.S. D&O business vary by year and subset, but for the most recent accident years, it is assumed to have been generally close to zero. After evaluating the historical loss cost levels from prior accident years since the early 1990s, including the potential effect of losses relating to the credit crisis, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the actual variation in loss cost levels for these subsets could vary by approximately 10 percent lower or higher on a year-over-year basis than the assumptions actually utilized in the year-end 2017 reserve review. Because U.S. D&O business has exhibited highly volatile loss trends from one accident year to the next, there is the possibility of an exceptionally high deviation. In our analysis, the effects of loss cost trend assumptions affect the results through the a priori loss ratio assumptions used for the Bornhuetter-Ferguson and Cape Cod methods, which impact the projections for the more recent accident years.\n",
      "The selected loss development factors are also an important assumption, but are less critical than for U.S. Excess Casualty. Because these classes are written on a claims made basis, the loss reporting and development tail is much shorter than for U.S. Excess Casualty. However, the high severity nature of the losses does create the potential for significant deviations in loss development patterns from one year to the next. Similar to U.S. Excess Casualty, after evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss development factors could change by an amount equivalent to a shift by six months from those actually utilized in the year-end 2017 reserve review.\n",
      "Europe Casualty and Financial Lines\n",

      "For short-tail lines such as Property and Special Risks, variance in outcomes for individual large claims or events can have a significant impact on results. These outcomes generally relate to unique characteristics of events such as catastrophes or losses with significant business interruption claims.\n",

      "Key Assumptions\n",
      "U.S. Run-off Long Tail Insurance lines\n",
      "We historically have used a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for excess workers’ compensation and other run-off segments. For environmental claims, we have utilized a variety of methods including traditional loss development approaches, claim department and other expert evaluations of the ultimate costs for certain claims and survival ratio metrics.\n",
      "U.S. Run-off Long Tail Insurance lines is an extremely long-tail class of business, with a much greater than normal uncertainty as to the appropriate loss development factors for the tail of the loss development. Specifically for excess workers’ compensation, after evaluating the historical loss development factors for prior accident years since the 1980s as well as the development over the past several years of the ground up loss projections utilized to help select the loss development factors in the tail for this class of business, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the tail factor beyond 30 years could vary by 10 percent above or below that actually indicated in the 2017 loss reserve review.\n",
      "Other Reserve Items\n",
      "Loss adjustment expenses (LAE) are separated into two broad categories, allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE), also referred to as legal defense and cost containment or “legal” and unallocated loss adjustment expenses (ULAE), which includes certain claims adjuster fees and other internal claim management costs.\n",
      "We determine reserves for legal expenses for each class of business by one or more actuarial or structural driver methods. For the majority of segments, legal costs are analyzed in conjunction with losses. For segments where they are separately analyzed the methods used generally include development methods comparable to those described for loss development methods. The development could be based on either the paid loss adjustment expenses or the ratio of paid loss adjustment expenses to paid losses, or both. Other methods include the utilization of expected ultimate ratios of paid loss expense to paid losses, based on actual experience from prior accident years or from similar product lines of business.\n",
      "The bulk of adjuster expenses are allocated and charged to individual claim files. For these expenses, we generally determine reserves based on calendar year ratios of adjuster expenses paid to losses paid for the particular product line of business. For other internal claim costs, which generally relate to specific claim department expenses that are not allocated to individual claim files such as technology costs and other broad initiatives, we look at historic and expected expenditures for these items and project these into the future.\n",
      "The incidence of LAE is directly related to the frequency, complexity and level of underlying claims. As a result, a key driver of variability in LAE is the variability in the overall claims, particularly for long tail lines.\n",
      "The following sensitivity analysis table summarizes the effect on the loss reserve position of using certain alternative loss cost trend (for accident years where we use expected loss ratio methods) or loss development factor assumptions rather than the assumptions actually used in determining our estimates in the year-end loss reserve analyses in 2017:\n",
      "(a) Tail factor increase of 2 percent for guaranteed cost business and 6 percent for deductible business.\n",
      "(b) Tail factor decrease of 1.5 percent for guaranteed cost business and 4 percent for deductible business.\n",

      "Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health Insurance Contracts\n",
      "Long-duration traditional products include whole life insurance, term life insurance, accident and health insurance, long-term care insurance, and certain payout annuities for which the payment period is life-contingent, which include certain of our single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements.\n",
      "For long-duration traditional business, a “lock-in” principle applies. The assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. The assumptions include mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses, and investment returns. These assumptions are typically consistent with pricing inputs. The assumptions also include margins for adverse deviation, principally for key assumptions such as mortality and interest rates used to discount cash flows, to reflect uncertainty given that actual experience might deviate from these assumptions. Establishing margins at contract inception requires management judgment. The extent of the margin for adverse deviation may vary depending on the uncertainty of the cash flows, which is affected by the volatility of the business and the extent of our experience with the product.\n",
      "Loss recognition occurs if observed changes in actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses under loss recognition testing. To determine whether loss recognition exists, we determine whether a future loss is expected based on updated current assumptions. If loss recognition exists, we recognize the loss by first reducing DAC through amortization expense, and, if DAC is depleted, record additional liabilities through a charge to policyholder benefit expense. Because of the long-term nature of many of our liabilities subject to the “lock-in” principle, small changes in certain assumptions may cause large changes in the degree of reserve adequacy. In particular, changes in estimates of future invested asset returns have a large effect on the degree of reserve deficiency.\n",
      "For additional information on loss recognition see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "Groupings for loss recognition testing are consistent with our manner of acquiring, servicing, and measuring the profitability of the business and are applied by product groupings, including traditional life, payout annuities and long-term care insurance. Once loss recognition has been recorded for a block of business, the old assumption set is replaced and the assumption set used for the loss recognition would then be subject to the lock-in principle. Key judgments made in loss recognition testing include the following:\n",
      "• To determine investment returns used in loss recognition tests, we typically match liabilities with assets of comparable duration, to the extent practicable, and then project future cash flows on those assets. Assets supporting insurance liabilities are primarily comprised of a diversified portfolio of high to medium quality fixed maturity securities, and may also include, to a lesser extent, alternative investments. Our projections include a reasonable allowance for investment expenses and expected credit losses over the projection horizon. A critical assumption in the projection of expected investment income is the assumed net rate of investment return at which excess cash flows are to be reinvested. For products in which asset and liability durations are matched relatively well, this is less of a consideration since interest on excess cash flows are not a significant component of future cash flows. For the reinvestment rate assumption, anticipated future changes to the yield curves could have a large effect. Given the interest rate environment applicable at the date of our most recent loss recognition tests, we assumed a modest and gradual increase in long-term interest rates over time.\n",
      "• For mortality assumptions, key judgments include the extent of industry versus own experience to base future assumptions as well as the extent of expected mortality improvements in the future. The latter judgment is based on a combination of historical mortality trends and advice from industry, public health and demography specialists that were consulted by AIG’s actuaries and published industry information.\n",
      "• For surrender rates, a key judgment involves the correlation between expected increases/decreases in interest rates and increases/decreases in surrender rates. To support this judgment, we compare crediting rates on our products to expected rates on competing products under different interest rate scenarios.\n",
      "• For in-force long-term care insurance, rate increases are allowed but must be approved by state insurance regulators. Consequently, the extent of rate increases that may be assumed requires judgment. In establishing our assumption for rate increases for long-term care insurance, we consider historical experience as to the frequency and level of rate increases approved by state regulators.\n",

      "Significant unrealized appreciation on investments in a low interest rate environment may cause DAC to be adjusted and additional future policy benefit liabilities to be recorded through a charge directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (“shadow loss recognition”). These charges are included, net of tax, with the change in net unrealized appreciation of investments. In applying shadow loss recognition, the Company overlays unrealized gains onto loss recognition tests without revising the underlying test. Accordingly, there is limited additional judgment in this process.\n",
      "For additional information on shadow loss recognition see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "Guaranteed Benefit Features of Variable Annuity Products\n",
      "Variable annuity products offered by our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement product lines offer guaranteed benefit features. These guaranteed features include guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) that are payable in the event of death or other instances, and living benefits that are payable in the event of annuitization, or, in other instances, at specified dates during the accumulation period. Living benefits primarily include guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB).\n",
      "For additional information on these features see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "The liability for GMDB, which is recorded in Future policyholder benefits, represents the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account value, with the excess recognized ratably through Policyholder benefits and losses incurred over the accumulation period based on total expected fee assessments. The liabilities for GMWB, which are recorded in Policyholder contract deposits, are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value of the liabilities recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses).\n",
      "Our exposure to the guaranteed amounts is equal to the amount by which the contract holder’s account balance is below the amount provided by the guaranteed feature. A variable annuity contract may include more than one type of guaranteed benefit feature; for example, it may have both a GMDB and a GMWB. However, a policyholder can generally only receive payout from one guaranteed feature on a contract containing a death benefit and a living benefit, i.e., the features are generally mutually exclusive (except a surviving spouse who has a rider to potentially collect both a GMDB upon their spouse’s death and a GMWB during his or her lifetime). A policyholder cannot purchase more than one living benefit on one contract. Declines in the equity markets, increased volatility and a sustained low interest rate environment increase our exposure to potential benefits under the guaranteed features, leading to an increase in the liabilities for those benefits.\n",

      "Policy acquisition costs and policy issuance costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal of existing insurance contracts related to universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) are generally deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the expected lives of the contracts, except in instances where significant negative gross profits are expected in one or more periods. Estimated gross profits include net investment income and spreads, net realized capital gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses, and mortality gains and losses. In estimating future gross profits, lapse assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on DAC amortization. For fixed deferred annuity contracts, the future spread between investment income and interest credited to policyholders is a significant judgment, particularly in a low interest rate environment.\n",
      "If the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC and related reserves, including VOBA, SIA, guaranteed benefit reserves and unearned revenue reserve (URR), are recalculated using the new assumptions, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. Updating such assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.\n",
      "In estimating future gross profits for variable annuity products as of December 31, 2017, a long-term annual asset growth assumption of 7.0 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected) was applied to estimate the future growth in assets and related asset-based fees. In determining the asset growth rate, the effect of short-term fluctuations in the equity markets is partially mitigated through the use of a reversion to the mean methodology, whereby short-term asset growth above or below the long-term annual rate assumption impacts the growth assumption applied to the five-year period subsequent to the current balance sheet date. The reversion to the mean methodology allows us to maintain our long-term growth assumptions, while also giving consideration to the effect of actual investment performance.

The standard also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties and additional disclosures. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, based on technical merits, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recognized in the financial statements. A tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement.\n",

      "On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted Public Law 115-97, known informally as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Tax Act reduces the statutory rate of U.S. federal corporate income tax to 21 percent and enacts numerous other changes impacting AIG and the insurance industry. Additionally, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 addresses situations where accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act under ASC 740 may be incomplete upon issuance of an entity’s financial statements and provides a one-year measurement period from the enactment date to complete the accounting under ASC 740. As of December 31, 2017, we had not fully completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. Our provision for income taxes for the periods ended December 31, 2017, is based in part on a reasonable estimate of the effects on existing deferred tax balances and of certain provisions of the Tax Act.\n",
      "The Tax Act includes a provision for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) under which taxes on foreign income are imposed on the excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of certain foreign subsidiaries. We have made a policy election to treat GILTI as an in period tax charge when incurred in future periods for which no deferred taxes need to be provided.\n",

The transactions include the cession of approximately $32 billion of reserves from the Legacy Life and Retirement Run-off Lines and approximately $5 billion of reserves from the Legacy General Insurance Run-off Lines relating to business written by multiple AIG legal entities. This represented over 80 percent of the insurance reserves in the Legacy Portfolio as of December 31, 2017.

We continued to operate under difficult market conditions in 2017, characterized by factors such as historically low interest rates, the Department of Labor’s (the DOL) final fiduciary duty rule (the DOL Fiduciary Rule), historically high levels of catastrophic events, slowing growth in China and Euro-Zone economies, and the formal commencement of the UK’s withdrawal from its membership in the European Union (the EU) (commonly referred to as Brexit). Brexit has also affected the U.S. dollar/British pound exchange rate and increased the volatility of exchange rates among the euro, British pound and the Japanese yen (the Major Currencies), which may continue for some time.\n",
      "Impact of Changes in the Interest Rate Environment\n",
      "Interest rates have remained at historically low levels throughout 2017. Certain markets in which we operate have experienced negative interest rates. A sustained low interest rate environment negatively affects sales of interest rate sensitive products in our industry and may negatively impact the profitability of our existing business as we reinvest cash flows from investments, including increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolios. We actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through portfolio selection and asset-liability management, including spread management strategies for our investment-oriented products and economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable and fixed index annuities.\n",
      "AIG | 2017 Form 10-K 59\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Executive Summary\n",
      "Annuity Sales and Surrenders\n",
      "The sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry. Low long-term interest rates put pressure on investment returns, which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products. However, our disciplined rate setting has helped to mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. As long as the low interest rate environment continues, conditions will be challenging for the fixed annuity market. Rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased sales, but may also drive higher surrenders. Customers are, however, currently buying fixed annuities with surrender charge periods of four to seven years in pursuit of higher returns, which may help mitigate the rate of increase in surrenders in a rapidly rising rate environment. In addition, older contracts that have higher minimum interest rates and continue to be attractive to the contract holders have driven better than expected persistency in Fixed Annuities, although the reserves for such contracts have continued to decrease over time in amount and as a percentage of the total annuity portfolio. We will closely monitor surrenders of Fixed Annuities as contracts with lower minimum interest rates come out of the surrender charge period in a more attractive rate environment. Low interest rates have also driven growth in our fixed index annuity products, which provide additional interest crediting tied to favorable performance in certain equity market indices and the availability of guaranteed living benefits. Changes in interest rates significantly impact the valuation of our liabilities for guaranteed products with income features and the value of the related hedging portfolio.\n",
      "Reinvestment and Spread Management\n",
      "We actively monitor fixed income markets, including the level of interest rates, credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve. We also frequently review our interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for new and in-force business. Business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a historically low interest rate environment. The low interest rate environment makes it more difficult to profitably price many of our products and puts margin pressure on existing products, due to the challenge of investing recurring premiums and deposits and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows in the low interest rate environment while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity. In addition, there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain in-force business. Specifically, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities.\n",
      "The contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in products may reduce spreads in a sustained low interest rate environment and thus reduce future profitability. Although this interest rate risk is partially mitigated through the asset-liability management process, product design elements and crediting rate strategies, a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability.\n",
      "For additional information on our investment and asset-liability management strategies see Investments.\n",
      "For investment-oriented products in our Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance and Institutional Markets businesses, our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business, modifying or limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads, using asset-liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable, and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. Renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals in accordance with state and federal laws and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. We will continue to adjust crediting rates on in-force business to mitigate the pressure on spreads from declining base yields, but our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by the competitive environment, contractual minimum crediting rates, and provisions that allow rates to be reset only at pre-established intervals.\n",
      "Of the aggregate fixed account values of our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement annuity products, 73 percent were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at December 31, 2017. The percentage of fixed account values of our annuity products that are currently crediting at rates above one percent was 69 percent and 70 percent at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These businesses continue to focus on pricing discipline and strategies to reduce the minimum guaranteed interest crediting rates offered on new sales. In the core universal life business in our Life Insurance business, 71 percent of the account values were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at December 31, 2017.\n",

      "Assumption Updates and Loss Recognition\n",
      "Spreads and surrender rates are important components of the future profit assumptions that drive the rate we use to amortize DAC and related reserves for investment-oriented products. If future profit assumptions change significantly, we may be required to recalculate DAC and related reserves, and reflect any resulting adjustments in current period income. In addition to investment-oriented products, certain traditional long-duration products for which we do not have the ability to adjust interest rates, such as payout annuities, are exposed to reduced earnings and potential loss recognition reserve increases in a sustained low interest rate environment.\n",
      "For discussion of such adjustments recorded in our Life and Retirement and Legacy Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines see Insurance Reserves - Life and Annuity Reserves and DAC - Update of Actuarial Assumptions.\n",
      "General Insurance\n",
      "The impact of low interest rates on our General Insurance segment is primarily on our long-tail Casualty line of business. We expect limited impacts on our existing long-tail Casualty business as the duration of our assets is slightly longer than that of our liabilities. We do expect sustained low interest rates will impact new and renewal business for the long-tail Casualty line as we may not be able to adjust our future pricing consistent with our profitability objectives to fully offset the impact of investing at lower rates. However, we will continue to maintain pricing discipline and risk selection.\n",
      "In addition, for our General Insurance segment and General Insurance run-off lines reported within the Legacy Portfolio, sustained low interest rates may unfavorably affect the net loss reserve discount for workers’ compensation, and to a lesser extent could favorably impact assumptions about future medical costs, the combined net effect of which could result in higher net loss reserves.\n",

      "Our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement operating segments provide products and services that are subject to restrictions imposed by the ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, including the requirements of the DOL Fiduciary Rule, related exemption amendments, and subsequent interpretative guidance and bulletins. Overall, the DOL Fiduciary Rule, as currently promulgated, would result in increased compliance costs and may create increased exposure to legal claims under certain circumstances, including class actions. Following the extension of the applicability dates of the DOL Fiduciary Rule and related exemptions announced by the DOL in April 2017, the new definition of fiduciary and the impartial conduct standards under the DOL Fiduciary Rule became applicable on June 9, 2017, with the remaining provisions of the rule scheduled to become applicable on January 1, 2018. On November 29, 2017, the DOL finalized an 18-month delay of the elements of the rule that have not yet taken effect.\n",
      "Uncertainty in the annuity market around the implementation of the DOL Fiduciary Rule has negatively impacted industry sales of annuity products, including those offered by Individual Retirement as reflected in declines of premiums and deposits and net flows in our variable annuity product line during the 12-month period ended December 31, 2017. Despite these effects, we believe our diverse complement of annuity product offerings position Individual Retirement and Group Retirement to effectively compete in this evolving retirement market environment.\n",
      "In addition to the DOL reexamining the Fiduciary Rule, the Securities and Exchange Commission and state insurance regulators are also engaged in efforts to evaluate standards of conduct for investment advice, and to impose fiduciary duties on financial advisers who give investment advice. These regulatory initiatives may also create additional uncertainties in the annuity marketplace that could affect our distribution partners and the industry sales of annuity products. While we cannot yet predict what impact these developments will have on our businesses, we are closely following the ongoing review and assessment of the DOL Fiduciary Rule as well as these other federal and state-level developments.\n",
      "Impact of Currency Volatility\n",
      "Currency volatility remains acute. Such volatility affected line item components of income for those businesses with substantial international operations. In particular, growth trends in net premiums written reported in U.S. dollars can differ significantly from those measured in original currencies. The net effect on underwriting results, however, is significantly mitigated, as both revenues and expenses are similarly affected.\n",
      "These currencies may continue to fluctuate, in either direction, especially as a result of the UK’s announced exit from the EU, and such fluctuations will affect net premiums written growth trends reported in U.S. dollars, as well as financial statement line item comparability.\n",
      "General Insurance businesses are transacted in most major foreign currencies. The following table presents the average of the quarterly weighted average exchange rates of the Major Currencies, which have the most significant impact on our businesses:\n",

      "Changes specific to the insurance industry include the calculation of insurance tax reserves and related transition adjustments, amortization of specified policy acquisition expenses, treatment of separate account dividends received deductions, and computation of pro-ration adjustments. Provisions of the Tax Act with broader application include reductions or elimination of deductions for certain items, e.g., reductions to corporate dividends received deductions, disallowance of entertainment expenses, and limitations on the deduction of certain executive compensation costs. These provisions, generally, will result in an increase in AIG’s taxable income in the years beginning after December 31, 2017.\n",
      "Consistent with current income tax accounting requirements, we have remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities with reference to the statutory income tax rate of 21 percent and taking into consideration other provisions of the Tax Act. As of December 31, 2017, we had not fully completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. Our provision for income taxes for the period ended December 31, 2017, is based in part on a reasonable estimate of the effects on existing deferred tax balances and of certain provisions of the Tax Act. To the extent a reasonable estimate of the impact of certain provisions was determinable, we recorded provisional estimates as a component of our provision for income taxes on continuing operations. To the extent a reasonable estimate of the impact of certain provisions was not determinable, we have not recorded any adjustments and have continued accounting for them in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of the tax laws in effect before enactment of the Tax Act.

Accordingly, no provision for income taxes related to GILTI or BEAT was recorded as of December 31, 2017.\n",
      "For the period ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a provisional estimate of income tax effects of the Tax Act of $6.7 billion, including a tax charge of $6.7 billion attributable to the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate and tax benefit of $38 million related to the deemed repatriation tax.\n",
      "In our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we made certain assumptions related to the impact of the Tax Act on our future taxable income. Generally, the Tax Act provisions result in an increase in our taxable income and, thus, accelerate utilization of our tax attribute deferred tax asset. Accordingly, we do not currently anticipate that our reliance on provisional estimates would have a material impact on our determination of the realizability of our deferred tax assets.\n",
      "Repatriation Assumptions\n",
      "As a result of the Tax Act, the majority of accumulated foreign earnings that were previously untaxed will become subject to a one-time deemed repatriation tax. Going forward, foreign earnings not taxed as part of the one-time deemed repatriation (or otherwise taxed currently under the GILTI or subpart F regimes) will generally be exempt from U.S. tax upon repatriation. Notwithstanding the changes, U.S. tax on foreign exchange gain or loss and certain non-U.S. withholding taxes will continue to be applicable upon future repatriations of foreign earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we consider our foreign earnings with respect to certain operations in Canada, South Africa, the Far East, Latin America, Bermuda as well as the European, Asia Pacific and Middle East regions to be indefinitely reinvested. These earnings relate to ongoing operations and have been reinvested in active business operations. Deferred taxes have been provided on earnings of non-U.S. affiliates whose earnings are not indefinitely reinvested.\n",
      "Impact of Deemed Repatriation Tax on Liquidity\n",
      "The Tax Act requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax, net of tax credits related to applicable foreign taxes paid, on previously untaxed current and accumulated earnings and profits (E&P) of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. In the determination of the deemed repatriation tax, we reviewed estimated post-1986 E&P of the relevant foreign subsidiaries, and any related non-U.S. income tax paid on such earnings. Based on this analysis, we were able to determine a reasonable estimate and we have recorded a provisional estimated tax benefit of $38 million. This amount is not considered to be material to our liquidity and capital resources.\n",
      "Impact to Effective Tax Rate on Future Consolidated Results of Operations\n",
      "We currently estimate that effective tax rate on future consolidated results of operations would be 21-22 percent, excluding impact of the items that cannot be forecasted. The effective tax rate is anticipated to exceed the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily because we have operations in jurisdictions where statutory income tax rates exceed 21 percent.\n",

      "For the year ended December 31, 2017, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was not meaningful. The effective tax rate differs from the 2017 statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to\n",

Insurance companies compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product pricing, service and terms and conditions. General Insurance seeks to distinguish itself in the insurance industry primarily based on its well-established brand, global franchise, multinational capabilities, financial and capital strength, innovative products, claims expertise to handle complex claims, expertise in providing specialized coverages and customer service.\n",
      "We serve our business and individual customers on a global basis - from the largest multinational corporations to local businesses and individuals. Our clients benefit from our substantial underwriting expertise.\n",
      "Our challenges include:\n",
      "• long-tail Commercial Lines exposures that create added challenges to pricing and risk management;\n",
      "• over capacity in certain lines of business that creates downward market pressure on pricing;\n",
      "• tort environment volatility in certain jurisdictions and lines of business; and\n",
      "• volatility in claims arising from natural and man-made catastrophes.\n",
      "OUTLOOK-INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC FACTORS\n",
      "Below is a discussion of the industry and economic factors impacting our operating segments:\n",
      "General Insurance - North America\n",
      "Commercial Lines continues to face challenging market conditions, with excess capacity negatively impacting the rate environment and suppressing margins. However, we continue to achieve positive rate increases across a number of lines and sub-segments as a result of our disciplined underwriting strategy and focus on risk selection. We continue to observe higher loss cost trends in Casualty, in particular Excess Casualty. We anticipate a positive impact on market pricing for Property following recent catastrophe activity, and observed progressive rate improvements throughout the fourth quarter of 2017. The more profitable segments of Commercial Lines remain highly competitive; however, we continue to achieve growth in several of our high margin businesses.\n",
      "Personal Insurance growth prospects are supported by the need for full life cycle products and coverage, increases in personal wealth accumulation, and awareness of insurance protection and risk management. We compete in the high net worth market, accident and health insurance, travel insurance, and warranty services and will continue to expand our innovative products and services to distribution partners and clients.\n",
      "General Insurance - International\n",
      "We believe our global presence provides Commercial Lines and Personal Insurance a distinct competitive advantage, as the demand for multinational cross-border coverage and services increase due to the internationalization of customers.\n",
      "The Commercial Lines market continues to be highly competitive, with increased pressure on rates, particularly in Europe and the Asia Pacific region, due to increased market capacity. Despite this, we are continuing to grow our most profitable segments across all regions and are maintaining market leadership in key developed markets. We are actively remediating our underperforming segments, maintaining our underwriting discipline and continuing our risk selection strategy to maintain profitability.\n",
      "Personal Insurance focuses on individual customers, as well as group and corporate clients. Although market competition within Personal Insurance has increased, we continue to benefit from the underwriting quality, portfolio diversity, and low volatility of the short-tailed risk in the business. We expect our newly formed entity in Japan - AIG Sonpo - to provide the necessary scale and platform to compete more efficiently in the Japanese market. Outside of Japan, Personal Insurance continues to invest selectively in international markets, which we believe have higher potential for sustainable profitability.\n",

      "Life and Retirement operates in the highly competitive insurance and financial services industry in the U.S. and select international markets, competing against various financial services companies, including mutual funds, banks and other life insurance companies. Competition is primarily based on product pricing and design, distribution, financial strength, customer service and ease of doing business.\n",
      "Our business remains competitive due to its long-standing market leading positions, innovative products, distribution relationships across multiple channels, customer-focused service and strong financial ratings.\n",
      "Our primary challenges include:\n",
      "• a sustained low interest rate environment, which makes it difficult to profitably price new products and puts margin pressure on existing business due to lower reinvestment yields;\n",
      "• increased competition in our primary markets, including aggressive pricing of annuities by private equity-backed annuity writers, increased competition and consolidation of employer groups in the group retirement planning market, and peers with lower profitability targets in the pension funding space;\n",
      "• increasingly complex new and proposed regulatory requirements, which have created uncertainty that is affecting industry growth; and\n",
      "• investments to upgrade our technology and underwriting processes challenge our management of general operating expenses.\n",
      "OUTLOOK-INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC FACTORS\n",
      "Below is a discussion of the industry and economic factors impacting our specific operating segments:\n",
      "Individual Retirement\n",
      "Increasing life expectancy and reduced expectations for traditional retirement income from defined benefit programs and fixed income securities are leading Americans to seek additional financial security as they approach retirement. The strong demand for individual variable and fixed index annuities with guaranteed income features has attracted increased competition in this product space. In response to the continued low interest rate environment, which has added pressure to profit margins, we have developed guaranteed income benefits for both variable and fixed index annuities with margins that are less sensitive to the level of interest rates.\n",
      "Changes in the interest rate environment can have a significant impact on sales, surrender rates, investment returns, guaranteed income features, and spreads in the annuity industry.\n",
      "Individual Retirement provides products and services that are subject to the requirements of the DOL Fiduciary Rule.\n",
      "Group Retirement\n",
      "Group Retirement competes in the defined contribution market under the VALIC brand. VALIC is a leading retirement plan provider in the U.S. for K-12 schools and school districts, higher education, healthcare, government and other not-for-profit institutions. The defined contribution market is a highly efficient and competitive market that requires support for both plan sponsors and individual participants. To meet this challenge, VALIC is investing in a client-focused technology platform to support improved compliance and self-service functionality. VALIC’s service model pairs self-service tools with its career financial advisors who provide individual plan participants with enrollment support and comprehensive financial planning services.\n",
      "Changes in the interest rate environment can have a significant impact on investment returns, guaranteed income features, and spreads, and a moderate impact on sales and surrender rates.\n",
      "Group Retirement provides products and services that are subject to the requirements of the DOL Fiduciary Rule.\n",
      "Life Insurance\n",
      "Consumers have a significant need for life insurance, whether it is used for income replacement for their surviving family, estate planning or wealth transfer. Additionally, consumers use life insurance to provide living benefits in case of chronic, critical or terminal illnesses, as well as to supplement retirement income.\n",
      "AIG | 2017 Form 10-K\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Business Segment Operations | Life and Retirement\n",
      "In response to consumer needs and a sustained low interest rate environment, our Life Insurance product portfolio has been evolving. We will continue to place a strong focus on indexed universal life products and de-emphasize products with long-duration interest rate guarantees.\n",
      "As life insurance ownership remains at historical lows in the United States, efforts to expand the reach and increase the affordability of life insurance are critical. The industry is investing in consumer-centric efforts to reduce traditional barriers to securing life protection by simplifying the sales and service experience. Digitally enabled processes and tools provide a fast, friendly and simple path to life insurance protection.\n",
      "Institutional Markets\n",
      "Institutional Markets serves a variety of needs for corporate clients. Demand is driven by a number of factors including the macroeconomic and regulatory environment. We expect to see continued growth in the pension risk transfer market as corporate plan sponsors look to transfer asset or liability, longevity, administrative and operational risks associated with their defined benefit plans.\n",
      "Changes in interest rate environment can have significant impact on investment returns and net investment spread, as well as reduce the tax efficiency associated with institutional life insurance products, dampening organic growth opportunities. Tax reform may lead to new opportunities in the stable value wrap market.\n",

As a result, deposits were lower in 2017 compared to 2016 and 2015. In 2017, net investment income included higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected and higher returns from alternative investments, partially offset by a reduction in the overall size of the hedge fund portfolio.

Adjusted pre-tax income also included adjustments in each year to update actuarial assumptions, which were net positive adjustments for all years presented.

The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products. The majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of fixed maturity securities.\n",
      "Investment Highlights in 2017\n",
      "• A decrease in interest rates and narrowing credit spreads resulted in a net unrealized gain in our investment portfolio. Net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio increased to approximately $13.9 billion as of December 31, 2017 from approximately $9.7 billion as of December 31, 2016.\n",
      "• We continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities and increased lending activities in mortgage loans with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income.\n",
      "• During the first quarter of 2017, we funded the adverse development reinsurance agreement entered into with NICO. The approximate $10.2 billion funding of this agreement was the primary reason for the decrease in the invested asset portfolio in 2017.\n",
      "• During 2017, we reduced our hedge fund portfolio by approximately $2.4 billion as a result of redemptions consistent with our planned reduction of exposure. Our hedge fund portfolio experienced above average returns in 2017 due to higher equity market performance.\n",
      "• Blended investment yields on new investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called.\n",
      "• Other-than-temporary impairments decreased due to lower impairments in our structured securities and corporate bond portfolios.\n",
      "• During the second quarter of 2017, we had a partial sale of our investment in Arch Capital Group Ltd. (Arch), which we received as part of the consideration for selling United Guaranty to Arch in 2016.\n",

      "Investment Strategies\n",
      "Investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local and general market conditions, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification.\n",
      "Some of our key investment strategies are as follows:\n",
      "• Fixed maturity securities held by the U.S. insurance companies included in General Insurance consist of a mix of instruments that meet our current risk-return, tax, liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectives.\n",
      "• Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by General Insurance companies consist primarily of high-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.\n",
      "• While more of a focus is placed on asset-liability management in Life and Retirement companies, our fundamental strategy across all of our investment portfolios is to optimize the duration characteristics of the assets within a target range based on comparable liability characteristics, to the extent practicable.\n",
      "• AIG Parent, included in Other Operations, actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities. Based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchases publicly traded, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity.\n",

      "Attribution of Net Investment Income to Operating Segments\n",
      "Net investment income is attributed to our businesses based on internal models consistent with the nature of the underlying businesses.\n",
      "For General Insurance - North America and International and Legacy General Insurance Run-Off Lines, we estimate investable funds based primarily on loss reserves and unearned premiums. The allocation of net investment income of the General Insurance companies to segments is calculated based on these estimated investable funds, consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities and the required economic capital allocation for each segment.\n",
      "For Life and Retirement - Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance, and Institutional Markets and Legacy Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines, net investment income is attributed based on invested assets from segregated product line portfolios held in our Life and Retirement companies. All invested assets of the Life and Retirement companies in excess of liabilities are allocated based on estimates of required economic capital allocation for each segment.\n",
      "Asset Liability Measurement\n",
      "For the General Insurance companies, the duration of liabilities for long-tail casualty lines is greater than that of other lines. As a result, the investment strategy within the General Insurance companies focuses on growth of surplus and preservation of capital, subject to liability and other business considerations.\n",
      "The General Insurance companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies and also invest in structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans. While invested assets backing reserves of the General Insurance companies are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities, we have continued to allocate a portion of our investment activity into asset classes that offer higher yields, particularly in the domestic operations. In addition, we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset-backed investments for their risk-return attributes, as well as to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates. This asset diversification has maintained stable average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity securities were largely unchanged. We expect to continue to pursue this investment strategy to meet the General Insurance companies’ liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives.\n",
      "In addition, the General Insurance companies seek to enhance returns through selective investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio.\n",
      "Fixed maturity securities of the General Insurance companies’ domestic operations, with an average duration of 3.9 years, are currently comprised of corporate bonds, structured securities, taxable municipal bonds and government and agency bonds as well as tax-exempt securities, which provide attractive risk-adjusted after-tax returns. The majority of these high quality investments are rated A or higher based on composite ratings.\n",
      "Fixed maturity securities held in the General Insurance companies’ foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated A or higher based on composite ratings, with an average duration of 3.6 years.\n",
      "The investment strategy of the Life and Retirement companies is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value, subject to liquidity requirements, capital constraints, diversification requirements, asset-liability management and available investment opportunities.\n",
      "The Life and Retirement companies use asset-liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses. The Life and Retirement companies' fundamental investment strategy is to maintain a diversified, high to medium quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities that, to the extent practicable, complements the characteristics of liabilities, including duration, which is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities, and as a result, certain portfolios are shorter in duration and others are longer in duration. An extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses, which may require us to further extend the duration of the investment portfolio.\n",
      "The Life and Retirement companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans.\n",
      "In addition, the Life and Retirement companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments.

      "Fixed maturity securities of the Life and Retirement companies domestic operations, with an average duration of 7.3 years, are comprised primarily of taxable corporate bonds, as well as taxable municipal and government bonds, and agency and non-agency structured securities.

      "NAIC Designations of Fixed Maturity Securities\n",
      "The Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the National Association of Insurance Companies (NAIC) evaluates the investments of U.S. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called ‘NAIC Designations.’ In general, NAIC Designations of ‘1’ highest quality, or ‘2’ high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while NAIC Designations of ‘3’ through ‘6’ generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade. The NAIC has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities, including non-agency RMBS and CMBS, which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses to better determine the appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities. These methodologies result in an improved NAIC Designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. The following tables summarize the ratings distribution of U.S. Insurance Companies fixed maturity security portfolio by NAIC Designation, and the distribution by composite AIG credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies.\n",

Approximately 18 percent of these securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies, and approximately 16 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated. Our investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services’ ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis.\n",
      "Moody’s Investors’ Service Inc. (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&P Global Inc. (S&P), or similar foreign rating services rate a significant portion of our foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio. Rating services are not available for some foreign-issued securities. Our Credit Risk Management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio’s non-rated fixed maturity securities. At December 31, 2017, approximately 22 percent of such investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of our internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated AAA, and approximately 8 percent were below investment grade or not rated.

This agreement was not renewed for new and renewal business for 2018 but remains in effect for risks attaching during the two-year term of the agreement.\n",
      "In 2017, we entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., under which we transferred to NICO 80 percent of the reserve risk on substantially all of our U.S. Commercial long-tail exposures for accident years 2015 and prior. Under this agreement, we ceded to NICO 80 percent of the losses on subject business paid on or after January 1, 2016 in excess of $25 billion of net paid losses, up to an aggregate limit of $25 billion. At NICO’s 80 percent share, NICO’s limit of liability under the contract is $20 billion. The covered losses ceded to NICO were $13.1 billion and the unexpired limit was $6.9 billion at December 31, 2017. We account for this transaction as retroactive reinsurance. We paid total consideration, including interest, of $10.2 billion. The consideration was placed into a collateral trust account as security for NICO’s claim payment obligations, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has provided a parental guarantee to secure the obligations of NICO under the agreement. This transaction resulted in a gain, which under U.S. GAAP retroactive reinsurance accounting is deferred and amortized into income over the settlement period.\n",

      "Update of Actuarial Assumptions\n",
      "The Life and Retirement companies review and update estimated gross profit projections used to amortize DAC and related items for investment-oriented products at least annually. Estimated gross profit projections include assumptions for investment-related returns and spreads, product-related fees and expenses, mortality gains and losses, policyholder behavior and other factors. In estimating future gross profits, lapse assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on DAC amortization. If the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC and related reserves (which may include VOBA, SIA, guaranteed benefit reserves and unearned revenue reserves) are recalculated using the new projections, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. Updating such projections may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.\n",
      "The Life and Retirement companies also review assumptions related to the valuation of variable annuity GMWB living benefits which are accounted for as embedded derivatives and measured at fair value. The fair value of these embedded derivatives is based on actuarial assumptions, including policyholder behavior, as well as capital market assumptions.\n",
      "Various assumptions were updated, including the following effective September 30, 2017:\n",
      "• we reduced our separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption related to equity market performance by 50 basis points to 7.0 percent and increased our reversion to the mean rates (gross of fees) to 3.74 percent for the Variable Annuity product line in Individual Retirement and 3.78 percent for the Variable Annuity product line in Group Retirement; and\n",
      "• we lowered our ultimate projected yields on invested assets by approximately five to 10 basis points. Projected yields are graded from a weighted average net GAAP book yield of existing assets supporting the business based on the value of the asset to a weighted average yield based on the duration of the assets excluding assets that mature during the grading period.

      "For long-duration traditional products, which include whole life insurance, term life insurance, accident and health insurance, long-term care insurance, and life-contingent single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements, a “lock-in” principle applies. The assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. Loss recognition occurs if observed changes in actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses under loss recognition testing. Underlying assumptions are reviewed periodically and updated as appropriate.\n",

In 2015, a net positive adjustment of $92 million reflected refinements to investment spread assumptions, lower terminations and decreases to expense assumptions.\n",
      "In Variable and Index Annuities, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net positive adjustment of $112 million in 2017, primarily due to an increase in the reversion to the mean rate used for projecting future estimated gross profit for variable annuity products and changes in volatility assumptions. The net positive adjustment was partially offset by a decrease in the separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption from 7.5 percent to 7.0 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected) and a negative adjustment in connection with the conversion to a new modeling platform for Index Annuities.\n",
      "In 2016, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net positive adjustment of $39 million in Variable and Index Annuities primarily due to favorable updates to assumptions for volatility, lapses, mortality and policy expenses, partially offset by a decrease in the separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption from 8.5 percent to 7.5 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected). The net positive adjustment included a net negative adjustment of approximately $24 million in connection with the conversion to a new modeling platform for variable annuities, primarily due to refinements to assumptions for guaranteed minimum interest rates and investment fees, partially offset by the impact of other refinements identified during the conversion.\n",

The net positive adjustment was partially offset by a decrease in the separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption from 7.5 percent to 7.0 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected) and decreases in fixed annuity spread and separate account fee assumptions. In 2016, a net negative adjustment of $47 million was primarily due to refinements in lapse and partial withdrawal assumptions and a decrease in the separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption from 8.5 percent to 7.5 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected). In 2015, a net positive adjustment of $48 million was primarily due to revisions to mortality and lapse assumptions, partially offset by decreased spread assumptions.\n",

In 2016, a net negative adjustment of $92 million was primarily due to refinement to reserves for universal life insurance with secondary guarantees due to lower assumed lapse rates. The update to Life Insurance assumptions in 2016 also included lower spread assumptions. In 2015, the net negative adjustment of $118 million was primarily due to lower assumed lapse rates for certain later-duration universal life with secondary guarantees.

      "In 2017, the update of actuarial assumptions resulted in a net negative adjustment of $14 million, primarily due to $13 million of loss recognition expense on long-term care business in the Legacy Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines resulting from model enhancements. In 2016, Legacy Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines recorded $622 million of loss recognition expense on payout annuities. The loss recognition reflected the establishment of additional reserves primarily as a result of mortality experience studies, which indicated increased longevity, particularly on disabled lives on a block of structured settlements underwritten prior to 2010. In 2015, Legacy Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines recorded loss recognition expense of $28 million to increase reserves for certain long-term care business.

      "Differences in Valuation of Embedded Derivatives and Economic Hedge Target\n",
      "The variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents an estimate of the underlying economic risks in our GMWB riders. The economic hedge target differs from the U.S. GAAP valuation of the GMWB embedded derivatives primarily due to the following:\n",
      "• The economic hedge target includes 100 percent of rider fees in present value calculations; the U.S. GAAP valuation reflects only those fees attributed to the embedded derivative such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero;\n",
      "• The economic hedge target uses best estimate actuarial assumptions and excludes explicit risk margins used for U.S. GAAP valuation, such as margins for policyholder behavior, mortality, and volatility; and\n",
      "• The economic hedge target excludes the non-performance or “own credit” risk adjustment used in the U.S. GAAP valuation, which reflects a market participant’s view of our claims-paying ability by incorporating an additional spread (the NPA spread) to the swap curve used to discount projected benefit cash flows. Because the discount rate includes the NPA spread and other explicit risk margins, the U.S. GAAP valuation is generally less sensitive to movements in interest rates and other market factors, and to changes from actuarial assumption updates, than the economic hedge target. For more information on our valuation methodology for embedded derivatives within policyholder contract deposits see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "The market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting. In addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program, the Life and Retirement companies have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees. The primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include:\n",
      "• Basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns, which may be either positive or negative;\n",
      "• Realized volatility versus implied volatility;\n",
      "• Actual versus expected changes in the hedge target driven by assumptions not subject to hedging, particularly policyholder behavior; and\n",
      "• Risk exposures that we have elected not to explicitly or fully hedge.\n",

      "Impact on Pre-tax Income (Loss)\n",
      "The impact on our pre-tax income (loss) of the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits and related hedging results includes changes in the fair value of the GMWB embedded derivatives, and changes in the fair value of related derivative hedging instruments, both of which are recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses). Realized capital gains (losses), as well as net investment income from changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities used in the hedging program, are excluded from adjusted pre-tax income of Individual Retirement and Group Retirement.\n",
      "The change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and the change in the value of the hedging portfolio are not expected to be fully offsetting, primarily due to the differences in valuation between the economic hedge target, the U.S. GAAP embedded derivatives and the fair value of the hedging portfolio, as discussed above. When corporate credit spreads widen, the change in the NPA spread generally reduces the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a gain, and when corporate credit spreads narrow or tighten, the change in the NPA spread generally increases the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a loss. In addition to changes driven by credit market-related movements in the NPA spread, the NPA balance also reflects changes in business activity and in the net amount at risk from the underlying guaranteed living benefits.\n",
      "The following table presents the net increase (decrease) to consolidated pre-tax income (loss) from changes in the fair value of the GMWB embedded derivatives and related hedges, excluding related DAC amortization:\n",
      "The net impact on pre-tax income from the GMWB and related hedges in 2017 (excluding related DAC amortization) was primarily driven by losses from actuarial assumption updates to lapse and volatility assumptions, tightening credit spreads on the NPA spread and the impact on the NPA volume of lower expected GMWB payments, driven by higher equity markets. In 2016, the net impact on pre-tax income was primarily driven by the impact of rising interest rates and equity markets late in the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in fair value losses in the hedging portfolio, which were not offset by decreases in the embedded derivative liabilities as the risk margins and other assumptions used in the U.S. GAAP valuation caused the embedded derivatives to be less sensitive to market changes than the related hedge portfolio. In addition, 2016 included losses from actuarial assumption updates due to lapse and mortality assumptions. In 2015, the net impact was primarily driven by increasing NPA spread and volume, which had a positive impact on pre-tax income, partially offset by an increase in embedded derivative liabilities driven by a decline in interest rates and unfavorable equity market performance.\n",
      "The change in the fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding update of actuarial assumptions and NPA, in 2017 was largely offset by the related hedging portfolio. However, in 2016, the change in fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding update of actuarial assumptions and NPA, reflected losses on the hedging portfolio driven by improvements in both interest rates and equity markets late in the fourth quarter of 2016, which were not offset by decreases in embedded derivative liabilities. In 2015, the change in the fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding update of actuarial assumptions and NPA, included losses from equity volatility, primarily in the third quarter of 2015, a decline in interest rates and unfavorable equity market performance.\n",

      "The decrease in the economic hedge target liability in 2017 was primarily due to positive equity markets, partially offset by tighter credit spreads and lower equity volatility. The increase in the economic hedge target liability in 2016 was primarily due to the update of actuarial assumptions offset by reductions from positive equity markets and increases in interest rates, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n",
      "Change in Fair Value of the Hedging Portfolio\n",
      "The changes in the fair value of the economic hedge target and, to a lesser extent, the embedded derivative valuation under U.S. GAAP, were offset in part by the following changes in the fair value of the variable annuity hedging portfolio:\n",
      "• Changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities, primarily corporate bonds for which the fair value option has been elected, are used as a capital-efficient way to economically hedge interest rate and credit spread-related risk. In 2017, the change in the fair value of the corporate bond hedging program reflected gains primarily due to tightening of credit spreads. The net gains in 2016 reflected the impact of credit spreads tightening and decreases in market interest rates in the first nine months of 2016, partially offset by an increase in rates in the fourth quarter of 2016. The net losses in 2015 reflected increases in market interest rates in the first six months of 2015 and credit spreads widening. The change in the fair value of the hedging bonds, which is excluded from the adjusted pre-tax income of the Individual Retirement and Group Retirement segments, is reported in net investment income on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).\n",
      "• Changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative contracts, which included swaps, swaptions and futures, resulted in a small net loss in 2017, which reflected increases in rates in the latter half of 2017, partially offset by the impact of interest rate declines in the first half of 2017. The net losses in 2016 reflected increases in rates in the fourth quarter of 2016, which more than offset the impact of interest rate declines in the first nine months of 2016. The net gains in 2015 reflected decreases in market interest rates in the latter half of 2015, partially offset by the impact of increases in rates in the first half of 2015.\n",
      "• The change in the fair value of equity derivative contracts, which included futures and options, resulted in losses in 2017, 2016 and 2015, which varied based on the relative growth in equity market returns in the respective years.\n",

      "The net adjustments to DAC amortization from the update of actuarial assumptions for estimated gross profits, including those reported within change in DAC related to net realized capital gains (losses), represented two percent, four percent and one percent of the DAC balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n",

      "Reversion to the Mean\n",
      "In 2017, we updated the long-term annual growth assumption applied to subsequent periods used in our reversion to the mean methodology for estimating future estimated gross profits for variable annuity products, from 7.5 percent to 7.0 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected). The five-year reversion to the mean period has met the criteria for adjustment in 2017. As a result, the average gross long-term return measurement start date was reset to December 31, 2011 for Individual Retirement and June 30, 2013 for Group Retirement; the reversion to the mean rates (gross of fees) were increased to 3.74 percent in Individual Retirement and 3.78 percent for Group Retirement. Sustained favorable equity market performance in excess of long-term assumptions could result in additional unlocking in the Individual Retirement or Group Retirement variable annuity product lines in the future, with a positive effect on pre-tax income in the period of the unlocking.\n",
      "In 2016, the long-term annual asset growth assumption was updated from 8.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The five-year reversion to the mean period has not met the criteria for adjustment in 2016 and 2015.\n",
      "For additional discussion of assumptions related to our reversion to the mean methodology see Critical Accounting Estimates - Estimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products.\n",
      "DAC and Reserves Related to Unrealized Appreciation of Investments\n",
      "DAC and Reserves for universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) are adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the change in DAC, unearned revenue, and benefit reserves with an offset to Other comprehensive income as if securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (shadow Investment-Oriented Adjustments). Shadow Investment-Oriented Adjustments to DAC and unearned revenue generally move in the opposite direction of the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, reducing the reported DAC and unearned revenue balance when market interest rates decline. Conversely, shadow Investment-Oriented Adjustments to benefit reserves generally move in the same direction as the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, increasing reported future policy benefit liabilities balance when market interest rates decline. Market interest rates decreased in 2017. As a result, the unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity securities held in the Life and Retirement companies that support the businesses at December 31, 2017 increased by $3.4 billion compared to December 31, 2016, which resulted in a decrease in DAC and unearned revenues and an increase in future policy benefit liabilities to reflect the shadow Investment-Oriented Adjustments.\n",
      "Similarly, for long-duration traditional products, significant unrealized appreciation of investments in a sustained low interest rate environment may cause additional future policy benefit liabilities (shadow loss reserves) with an offset to Other comprehensive income to be recorded. At December 31, 2017, future policy benefit liabilities increased to reflect additional shadow loss reserves.\n",

      "Liquidity and Capital Resources\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "Liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet our payment obligations. It is defined as cash and unencumbered assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost. We manage our liquidity prudently through various risk committees, policies and procedures, and a stress testing and liquidity risk framework established by our Treasury group with oversight by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Our liquidity risk framework is designed to manage liquidity at both AIG Parent and its subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six months under a liquidity stress scenario.\n",
      "See Enterprise Risk Management - Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement and Enterprise Risk Management - Liquidity Risk Management below for additional information.\n",
      "Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. Our primary source of ongoing capital generation is derived from the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. We must comply with numerous constraints on our minimum capital positions. These constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy at AIG and the individual businesses and are based on internally-defined risk tolerances, regulatory requirements, rating agency and creditor expectations and business needs. Actual capital levels are monitored on a regular basis, and using ERM’s stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital impact of potential macroeconomic, financial and insurance stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraints of both AIG and our insurance subsidiaries.\n",
      "We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events.\n",
      "Nevertheless, some circumstances may cause our cash or capital needs to exceed projected liquidity or readily deployable capital resources. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash or capital needs and loss of sources of liquidity and capital. In addition, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.\n",
      "Depending on market conditions, regulatory and rating agency considerations and other factors, we may take various liability and capital management actions. Liability management actions may include, but are not limited to, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers. Capital management actions may include, but are not limited to, paying dividends to our shareholders and share and/or warrant repurchases.\n",

Of this amount, $350 million was dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our General Insurance companies, $1.5 billion was dividends and loan repayments in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our Life and Retirement companies and $2 million was cash dividends from AIG Federal Savings Bank.\n",
      "AIG Parent also received a net amount of $2.2 billion in tax sharing payments in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our insurance businesses in 2017, reflecting $1.2 billion that was reimbursed by AIG Parent to our insurance businesses during the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily as a result of adjustments made to prior-year tax sharing payments. The tax sharing payments may continue to be subject to adjustment in future periods.\n",
      "The dividends, loan repayments and tax sharing payments from our Life and Retirement companies resulted from and were funded, in part, by excess statutory capital released by Life Insurance Reinsurance Transactions.\n",

AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities primarily include U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. Based upon an assessment of funding needs, the liquidity sources can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements or contributed as admitted assets to regulated insurance companies. AIG Parent liquidity is monitored through the use of various internal liquidity risk measures. AIG Parent’s primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from subsidiaries and credit facilities. AIG Parent’s primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, and operating expenses.\n",
      "We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy our reasonably foreseeable future requirements and meet our obligations to our creditors, debt-holders and insurance company subsidiaries. We expect to access the debt markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed.\n",
      "We utilize our capital resources to support our businesses, with the majority of capital allocated to our insurance operations. Should we have or generate more capital than is needed to support our business strategies (including organic growth or acquisition opportunities) or mitigate risks inherent to our business, we may develop plans to distribute such capital to shareholders via dividends or share repurchase authorizations or deploy such capital towards liability management.\n",
      "In the normal course, it is expected that a portion of the capital released by our insurance operations, by our other operations or through the utilization of AIG’s deferred tax assets may be available to support our business strategies, for distribution to shareholders or for liability management.\n",

The primary uses of liquidity are paid losses, reinsurance payments, benefit claims, surrenders, withdrawals, interest payments, dividends, expenses, investment purchases and collateral requirements.\n",
      "Our General Insurance companies may require additional funding to meet capital or liquidity needs under certain circumstances. Large catastrophes may require us to provide additional support to our affected operations. Downgrades in our credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, which could result in non-renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the subsidiary’s ability to meet its own obligations. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital. Other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include an economic collapse of a nation or region significant to our operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval.\n",
      "On January 20, 2017, certain of our General Insurance companies entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO under which they transferred to NICO 80 percent of reserve risk on substantially all of their U.S. Commercial long-tail exposures for accident years 2015 and prior. Under this agreement, these General Insurance companies ceded to NICO 80 percent of the paid losses on subject business paid on or after January 1, 2016 in excess of $25 billion of net paid losses, up to an aggregate limit of $25 billion. The total consideration paid, including interest, was $10.2 billion.\n",
      "Management believes that because of the size and liquidity of our Life and Retirement companies’ investment portfolios, normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience would not create significant liquidity risk. Furthermore, our Life and Retirement companies’ products contain certain features that mitigate surrender risk, including surrender charges. However, in times of extreme capital markets disruption, liquidity needs could outpace resources. As part of their risk management framework, our Life and Retirement companies continue to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue strategies and programs to improve their liquidity position and facilitate their ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio.\n",

Cash collateral received is invested in short-term investments. Additionally, the aggregate amount of securities that a Life and Retirement company is able to lend under its program at any time is limited to five percent of its general account statutory-basis admitted assets.

Although we can provide no assurance regarding whether the non-binding settlements will be finalized, the amount we currently expect to pay based on current proposed settlement terms is approximately $1.3 billion. This amount is net of payments previously made with respect to cross border financing transactions involving matters dating back to 1997 and other matters largely related to the same tax years. There remains uncertainty with regard to whether the settlements in principle will ultimately be approved by the relevant authorities as well as the amount and timing of any potential payments, which are not likely to be made before sometime in 2019.\n",

      "We are party to some agreements that contain “ratings triggers.” Depending on the ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies, these triggers could result in (i) the termination or limitation of credit availability or a requirement for accelerated repayment, (ii) the termination of business contracts or (iii) a requirement to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.\n",
      "In the event of adverse actions on our long-term debt ratings by the major rating agencies, AIGFP and certain other AIG entities would be required to post additional collateral under some derivative transactions or could experience termination of the transactions. Such requirements and terminations could adversely affect our business, our consolidated results of operations in a reporting period or our liquidity. In the event of a further downgrade of AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings, AIGFP and certain other AIG entities would be required to post additional collateral, and certain of the counterparties of AIGFP or of such other AIG entities would be permitted to terminate their contracts early.\n",
      "The actual amount of collateral that we would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade.\n",

      "Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "Risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns. We consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance.\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "We have an integrated process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm-wide risk appetite. Our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of AIG’s major risk positions. Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM. ERM supports our businesses and management in the embedding of risk management in our key day-to-day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing, monitoring, reporting, and mitigating the risks taken by us and our businesses. Nevertheless, our risk management efforts may not always be successful and material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or financial condition may occur.\n",
      "Risk Governance Structure\n",
      "Our risk governance structure fosters the development and maintenance of a risk and control management culture that encompasses all significant risk categories impacting our lines of business and functions. Accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit. We review our governance and committee structure on a regular basis and make changes as appropriate to continue to effectively manage and govern our risks and risk-taking.\n",
      "Our Board of Directors oversees the management of risk through its Risk and Capital Committee (RCC) and Audit Committee. Those committees regularly interact with other committees of the Board of Directors. Our Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reports to both the RCC and our Chief Executive Officer (CEO).\n",
      "The Group Risk Committee (GRC): The GRC is the senior management group responsible for assessing all significant risk issues on a global basis to protect our financial strength, optimize our intrinsic value, and protect our reputation. The GRC is chaired by our CRO. Its membership includes our CEO, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and other senior executives from across our corporate functions and business units. Our CRO reports periodically on behalf of the GRC to both the RCC and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Our CRO is also a member of the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) providing ERM the opportunity to contribute to, review, monitor and consider the impact of changes in strategy.\n",
      "Management committees that support the GRC are described below. These committees are comprised of senior executives and experienced business representatives from a range of functions and business units throughout AIG and its subsidiaries. These committees are charged with identifying, analyzing and reviewing specific risk matters within their respective mandates.\n",
      "Financial Risk Group (FRG): The FRG is responsible for the oversight of financial risks taken by AIG and our subsidiaries. Its mandate includes overseeing our aggregate credit, market, interest rate, capital, liquidity and model risks, as well as asset-liability management, derivatives activity, and foreign exchange transactions. It provides the primary corporate-level review function for all proposed transactions and business practices that are significant in size, complex in scope, or that present heightened legal, reputational, accounting or regulatory risks. The FRG is chaired by our CRO. Membership of the FRG also includes our CFO, Chief Investment Officer (CIO) and Treasurer.\n",
      "Technology, Operational Risk & Control Committee (TORCC): This committee oversees technology and operational risk management and control issues and activities across our businesses, functions, and geographic locations. The TORCC reviews our risk management practices and monitors current and emerging technology and operational risks, as well as management actions taken to reduce such risks to acceptable levels within our risk appetite. It primarily focuses on establishing the firm-wide framework for identifying, assessing, measuring, managing and monitoring technology and operational risks. The TORCC addresses firm-wide, rather than business-specific issues and is mandated to prioritize technology and operational improvements that are significant and transformational. The TORCC also provides a forum for senior management to assess our business technology and operational risk profiles that may affect our strategic objectives.\n",

The risk committees are responsible for the identification, assessment and monitoring of all sources of risk within their respective portfolios. Specific responsibilities include setting risk tolerances, reviewing the capital allocation framework, insurance portfolio optimization, and providing oversight of risk-adjusted metrics. In addition, each business unit has established subordinate committees at the legal entity level and has working groups in place that support these committees in executing their duties, such as ensuring policies are adhered to, and transactions are completed with risk appetite in mind. Together, these committees provide comprehensive risk oversight throughout the organization.\n",

      "Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement\n",
      "Risk Appetite Framework\n",
      "Our Risk Appetite Framework integrates stakeholder interests, strategic business goals and available financial resources. We balance these by seeking to take measured risks that are expected to generate repeatable, sustainable earnings and create long-term value for our shareholders. The framework includes our risk appetite statement approved by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof and a set of supporting tools, including risk tolerances, risk limits and policies, which we use to manage our risk profile and financial resources.\n",
      "We articulate our aggregate risk-taking by setting risk tolerances and thresholds on capital and liquidity measures. These measures are set at the AIG Parent level as well as the legal entity level and cover consolidated and insurance company capital and liquidity ratios. We must comply with standards for capital adequacy and maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all our obligations as they come due in accordance with our internal capital management and liquidity policies. Our risk tolerances take into consideration regulatory requirements, rating agency expectations, and business needs. The GRC routinely reviews the level of risk taken by the consolidated organization in relation to the established risk tolerances. A consolidated risk report is also presented periodically, as required, to the RCC by our CRO.\n",
      "Risk Limits\n",
      "A key component of our Risk Appetite Framework is having a process in place that establishes and maintains appropriate limits on the material risks identified for our core businesses and facilitates monitoring and meeting of both internal and external stakeholder expectations. Our objectives include:\n",
      "• Establishing risk monitoring, providing early warning indicators, and ensuring timely oversight and enforceability of limits;\n",
      "• Defining a consistent and transparent approach to limits governance; and\n",
      "• Aligning our business activities with our risk appetite statement.\n",
      "To support the monitoring and management of AIG’s and its business units’ material risks, ERM has an established limits framework that employs a three-tiered hierarchy:\n",
      "• Board-level risk tolerances are AIG’s aggregate capital and liquidity limits. They define the minimum level of capital and liquidity that we should maintain. These board-level risk tolerances require RCC approval.\n",
      "• AIG management level limits are risk type specific limits at the AIG consolidated level. These limits are defined and calibrated to constrain our concentration in specific risk types, to protect against taking risks that exceed the amount of overall capital AIG has available, and to protect against excess earnings volatility. These limits are approved by our CRO with consultation from the GRC.\n",
      "• BU and legal entity level limits are set to address key risks identified by ERM for the business unit and legal entities, protect capital and liquidity at legal entities and/or meet legal entity specific requirements of regulators and rating agencies. These limits are defined by the business unit and legal entity risk officers.\n",
      "All limits are reviewed by the FRG, GRC or relevant business unit risk committees on a periodic basis and revisions, if applicable, are approved by those committees.\n",
      "The business units are responsible for measuring and monitoring their risk exposures. ERM is responsible for monitoring compliance with limits and providing regular, timely reporting to our senior management and risk committees. Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner and are documented and escalated in accordance with their level of severity or materiality.\n",
      "Risk Identification and Measurement\n",
      "One tool we use to inform our Risk Appetite Framework is risk identification. We conduct risk identification through a number of processes at the business unit and corporate level focused on capturing our material risks and key areas of focus for follow-up risk management actions. A key initiative is our integrated bottom-up risk identification and assessment process down to the product-line level. These processes are used as a critical input to enhance and develop our analytics for measuring and assessing risks across the organization.\n",
      "We employ various approaches to measure, monitor, and manage risk exposures, including the utilization of a variety of metrics and early warning indicators. We use a proprietary internal capital and stress testing framework to measure our quantifiable risks for both insurance and non-insurance operations.\n",
      "AIG | 2017 Form 10-K 141\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "The internal capital framework quantifies our aggregate economic risk at a given confidence interval, after taking into account a level of diversification benefits between risk factors and business lines. We leverage the internal capital framework to help inform our consolidated risk consumption and profile as well as risk and capital allocation for our businesses.\n",
      "The stress testing framework measures risk over multiple time horizons and under different levels of stress. We develop a range of stress scenarios based on both internal experience and regulatory guidance. The stress tests are intended to ensure that sufficient resources are available under both idiosyncratic and systemic market stress conditions.\n",
      "The stress testing framework assesses our aggregate exposure to our most significant financial and insurance risks, including the risk in each of our key insurance company subsidiaries in relation to its capital needs under stress, risks inherent in our non-insurance company subsidiaries, and risks to AIG consolidated capital. We use this information to determine the resources needed at the AIG Parent level to support our subsidiaries and capital resources required to maintain consolidated company target capitalization levels.\n",
      "Credit Risk Management\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "Credit risk is defined as the risk that our customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due. Credit risk may also result from a downgrade of a counterparty’s credit ratings or a widening of its credit spreads.\n",
      "We devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures. These exposures may arise from, but are not limited to, fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees, letters of credit, and certain General Insurance businesses.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Our credit risks are managed by teams of credit professionals, subject to ERM oversight and various control processes. Their primary role is to assure appropriate credit risk management in accordance with our credit policies and procedures relative to our credit risk parameters. Our Chief Credit Officer (CCO) and credit executives are primarily responsible for the development, implementation and maintenance of a risk management framework, which includes the following elements related to our credit risks:\n",
      "• developing and implementing our company-wide credit policies and procedures;\n",
      "• approving delegated credit authorities to our credit executives and qualified credit professionals;\n",
      "• developing methodologies for quantification and assessment of credit risks, including the establishment and maintenance of our internal risk rating process;\n",
      "• managing a system of credit and program limits, as well as the approval process for credit transactions, above limit exposures, and concentrations of risk that may exist or be incurred;\n",
      "• evaluating, monitoring, reviewing and reporting of credit risks and concentrations regularly with senior management; and\n",
      "• approving appropriate credit reserves, credit-related other-than-temporary impairments and corresponding methodologies for all credit portfolios.\n",
      "We monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require mitigants, such as third-party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, including commercial bank-issued letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. We treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, and letters of credit as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data. We also monitor closely the quality of any trust collateral accounts.\n",

We are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities, on both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet through on- and off-balance sheet exposures. The Risk Officer within each business is responsible for creating a framework to properly identify these risks, then ensuring that they are appropriately measured, monitored and managed in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the Chief Market Risk Officer (CMRO).\n",

      "Many of our market risk exposures related to interest rates and equity returns are associated with our Life and Retirement companies and relate to both asset and liability exposures. In addition, these exposures are long-term in nature. Examples of liability-related exposures include interest rate sensitive surrenders in our fixed deferred annuity product portfolio. Also, we have equity market risk sensitive surrenders in our variable annuity product portfolio.

Changes in residential/commercial real estate prices can affect the valuation of residential/commercial mortgages, residential/commercial mortgage-backed securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential/commercial mortgages, trusts that include residential/commercial real estate and/or mortgages, residential mortgage insurance and reinsurance contracts and commercial real estate investments.\n",
      "Interest rates\n",
      "Interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities. Lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and make some of our product offerings less attractive to investors. Conversely, higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons. However, when rates rise quickly, there can be a temporary asymmetric GAAP accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income, and the offsetting decrease in the value of related liabilities may not be recognized. Changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, financial liabilities, insurance contracts including but not limited to universal life, fixed rate annuities, variable annuities and derivative contracts.\n",
      "Credit spreads\n",
      "Credit spreads measure an instrument’s risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default-free instrument. Changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including but not limited to corporate bonds, ABS, mortgage-backed securities, AIG-issued debt obligations, credit derivatives and derivative credit valuation adjustments. Much like higher interest rates, wider credit spreads with unchanged default losses mean more investment income in the long term. In the short term, quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income. A precipitous widening of credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the credit worthiness of bond obligors, potentially resulting in default losses.\n",
      "Foreign exchange (FX) rates\n",
      "We are a globally diversified enterprise with income, assets and liabilities denominated in, and capital deployed in, a variety of currencies. Changes in FX rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of balance sheet and income statement items as well as the settlement of cash flows exchanged in specific transactions.\n",
      "Commodity prices\n",
      "Changes in commodity prices (the value of commodities) can affect the valuation of publicly-traded commodities, commodity indices and derivatives on commodities and commodity indices. We are exposed to commodity prices primarily through their impact on the prices and credit quality of commodity producers’ debt and equity securities in our investment portfolio.\n",
      "Inflation\n",
      "Changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including AIG-issued debt obligations, derivatives and other contracts explicitly linked to inflation indices, and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly, via indexing, or implicitly, through medical costs or wage levels.\n",

      "Market risk is overseen at the corporate level within ERM through the CMRO, who reports directly to the CRO. The CMRO is supported by a dedicated team of professionals within ERM. Market Risk is managed by our finance, treasury and investment management corporate functions, collectively, and in partnership with ERM. The CMRO is primarily responsible for the development and maintenance of a risk management framework that includes the following key components:\n",
      "• written policies that define the rules for our market risk-taking activities and provide clear guidance regarding their execution and management;\n",
      "• a limit framework that aligns with our Board-approved risk appetite statement;\n",

      "Our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures. At the firm-wide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with AIG’s risk appetite statement. This is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework. Our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital and liquidity levels. At the market risk level, the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change on an economic basis.\n",
      "In addition, we continue to use enhanced economic, GAAP accounting and statutory capital-based risk measures at the market risk level, business-unit level and firm-wide levels. This process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures.\n",
      "We use a number of approaches to measure our market risk exposure, including:\n",
      "Examples include:\n",
      "Sensitivity analysis\n",
      "measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input\n",
      "• a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity securities,\n",
      "• a one basis point increase in credit spreads of fixed maturity securities, and\n",
      "• a one percent increase in prices of equity securities.\n",
      "Scenario analysis\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "(a) At December 31, 2017, the analysis covered $276.8 billion of $289.6 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded were $8.2 billion of loans. In addition, $4.6 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations. At December 31, 2016, the analysis covered $276.1 billion of $291.7 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded were $8.1 billion of loans and $2.5 billion of investments in life settlements. In addition, $5.0 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations.\n",
      "(b) At December 31, 2017, the analysis excluded $6.0 billion of long-term debt related to debt of consolidated investments, $642 million of AIGLH borrowings, $190 million of borrowings from the FHLB and $334 million of AIG Japan Holdings loans. At December 31, 2016, the analysis excluded $4.4 billion of long-term debt related to debt of consolidated investments, $642 million of AIGLH borrowings, $735 million of borrowings from the FHLB and $330 million of AIG Japan Holdings loans.\n",
      "(c) The balance sheet exposures for equity contracts and variable annuity and other embedded derivatives are also reflected under “Interest rate sensitive liabilities” above, and are not additive.\n",
      "(d) The majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag.\n",
      "The sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed as predictive of our future financial performance. We cannot ensure that our actual losses in any particular period will not exceed the amounts indicated above.\n",
      "We use duration and convexity metrics to measure price sensitivity to interest rate changes for interest rate sensitive assets excluding derivatives and long-term debt. Duration measures the relative sensitivity of the fair value of a financial instrument to changes in interest rates. Convexity measures the rate of change of duration with respect to changes in interest rates.\n",
      "Interest rate sensitivity of a derivative is calculated as change in its value with respect to plus a 100 basis point change in the interest rate environment, calculated as: scenario value minus base value, where base value is the value of the derivative under the yield curves as of the period end and scenario value is the value reflecting a 100 basis point parallel increase in all yield curves.\n",
      "We evaluate our interest rate risk without the effect of any correlation among other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the fair value of our financial liabilities and embedded derivatives. This scenario does not measure changes in value resulting from non-parallel shifts in the yield curve, which could produce different results.\n",
      "We evaluate our equity price risk without the effect of any correlation among other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the fair value of our financial liabilities and embedded derivatives. This scenario considers the direct impact of declines in equity prices and not changes in asset-based fees, changes in the estimated gross profits used for amortizing DAC, or changes in any other assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the embedded derivatives related to the living benefit features within variable annuity products. In addition, this scenario does not reflect the impact of basis risk, such as projections about the future performance of the underlying contract holder funds and actual fund returns, which we use as a basis for developing our hedging strategy.\n",
      "Foreign currency-denominated net asset position reflects our consolidated non-U.S. dollar assets less our consolidated non-U.S dollar liabilities on a GAAP basis, with certain adjustments. We use a bottom-up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory capital at the regulated insurance entity level. At the AIG Parent level, we monitor our foreign currency exposures against single currency and aggregate currency portfolio limits.\n",
      "Our foreign currency-denominated net asset position at December 31, 2017, decreased by $3.3 billion compared to December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.7 billion decrease in our Japanese yen position primarily due to the sale of Fuji Life and the unwinding of certain yen hedges; a $0.7 billion decrease in our euro position primarily due to the issuance of €1.0 billion euro denominated debt; and a $248 million decrease in our British pound position primarily due to an increase in reserves.\n",
      "For illustrative purposes, we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The estimated results presented in the table above should not be taken as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events.\n",
      "The sensitivity factors utilized for 2017 and presented above were selected based on historical data from 1997 to 2017, as follows (see the table below):\n",
      "• a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve is consistent with a one standard deviation movement of the benchmark ten-year treasury yield;\n",
      "• a 20 percent drop for equity and alternative investments is broadly consistent with a one standard deviation movement in the S&P 500; and\n",
      "• a 10 percent depreciation of foreign currency exchange rates is consistent with a one standard deviation movement in the U.S. dollar (USD)/Japanese yen (JPY) exchange rate.\n",

      "The risk monitoring responsibilities, owned by the business units, include ensuring compliance with market risk limits and escalation and remediation of limit breaches. Such activities must be reported to the ERM Market Risk team by the relevant business unit. This monitoring approach is aligned with our overall risk limits framework.\n",

      "Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations. Failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in insolvency, reduced operating flexibility, increased costs, reputational harm and regulatory action.\n",
      "AIG and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity both during the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash will be available to meet the obligations as they come due.\n",
      "AIG Parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are designed to allow us to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six months under a liquidity stress scenario. We maintain liquidity limits and minimum coverage ratios designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions. If we project that we will breach these tolerances, we will assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions. However, the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements.\n",

      "Assets may not be readily transformed into cash due to unfavorable market conditions. Market liquidity risk may limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs.\n",
      "Cash Flow Mismatch Risk\n",
      "Discrete and cumulative cash flow mismatches or gaps over short-term horizons under both expected and adverse business conditions may create future liquidity shortfalls.\n",
      "Event Funding Risk\n",
      "Additional funding may be required as the result of a trigger event. Event funding risk comes in many forms and may result from a downgrade in credit ratings, a market event, or some other event that creates a funding obligation or limits existing funding options.\n",
      "Financing Risk\n",
      "We may be unable to raise additional cash on a secured or unsecured basis due to unfavorable market conditions, AIG-specific issues, or any other issue that impedes access to additional funding.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Liquidity risk is overseen at the corporate level within ERM. The CRO has responsibility for the oversight of the Liquidity Risk Management Framework and delegates the day-to-day implementation of this framework to the AIG Treasurer. Our corporate treasury function manages liquidity risk, subject to ERM oversight and various control processes.\n",
      "The Liquidity Risk Management Framework is guided by the liquidity risk tolerance as set forth in the Board-approved risk appetite statement. The principal objective of this framework is to establish minimum liquidity requirements that protect our long-term viability and ability to fund our ongoing business, and to meet short-term financial obligations in a timely manner in both normal and stressed conditions.\n",

      "Comprehensive cash flow projections under normal conditions are the primary component for identifying and measuring liquidity risk. We produce comprehensive liquidity projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows. In addition, we perform stress testing by identifying liquidity stress scenarios and assessing the effects of these scenarios on our cash flow and liquidity.\n",
      "We use a number of approaches to measure our liquidity risk exposure, including:\n",

      "Minimum Liquidity Limits specify the amount of assets required to be maintained in specific liquidity portfolios to meet obligations as they arise over a specified time horizon under stressed liquidity conditions.\n",
      "Coverage Ratios\n",
      "Coverage Ratios measure the adequacy of available liquidity sources, including the ability to monetize assets to meet the forecasted cash flows over a specified time horizon. The portfolio of assets is selected based on our ability to convert those assets into cash under the assumed market conditions and within the specified time horizon.\n",

      "Governance\n",
      "Our operational risk governance sets the requirements necessary to embed a risk management culture throughout the organization. AIG and its consolidated subsidiaries establish and maintain operational risk and controls governance forums that include representatives from the relevant business units and corporate functions to appropriately manage significant operational risk exposures. At an enterprise level, the TORCC oversees operational risk. The TORCC addresses firm-wide rather than business-specific issues and is mandated to prioritize technology and operational improvements that are significant and transformational.\n",
      "Operational risk is overseen at the corporate level within ERM through the Head of AIG Operational and Technology Controls, who reports directly to our CRO. The Head of AIG Operational and Technology Controls is responsible for the development and maintenance of the operational risk framework that includes policies, standards and deployment of systems.\n",
      "Risk Identification, Measurement and Monitoring\n",
      "The ORM function within ERM oversees the operational risk policy and integrated risk and control framework, which includes risk identification, assessment, measurement, management and monitoring of operational risk exposures. ORM supports the TORCC and has responsibility to provide an aggregate view of our operational risk profile. As part of the framework, we employ a Three Lines of Defense model whereby the first line consists of business units and corporate functions that own and manage AIG risks, the second line consists of ERM and other control functions and serves as an independent advisor to the first line and has risk oversight\n",

A key area of ongoing development is to have business leaders assume ownership and accountability for the risks and controls in their operating units, including support functions, for the operational risks that arise in their own processes and activities. In line with the Three Lines of Defense Model, the ORM programs include, but are not limited to, several key components outlined below:\n",
      "• Risk Event Capture - enables every employee to identify, document, and escalate operational risk events, with a view to enhancing processes and promoting lessons learned.\n",
      "• Risk Assessments - allows for the assessment, measurement and management of the key operational risks within our business units and helps inform on the efficacy of our control environment.\n",
      "• Key Risk Indicators - enhances the ongoing monitoring and mitigation of operational risks and facilitate risk reporting.\n",
      "• Issues Management - enables a consistent tracking of issues across the firm, including policy and process exceptions, control deficiencies and findings from risk and control assessment activities.\n",
      "• Scenario Analyses - executed by first- and second-line professionals to identify potential risks that could result in financial losses in order to identify the financial implications of the risk to the firm and support the prioritization of operational risk treatment.\n",
      "ORM, working together with other control and assurance functions (e.g., Compliance, Financial Controls Unit / Sarbanes Oxley, Global Business Continuity, and Internal Audit) through the integrated risk and control framework, provides an independent view of operational risks for each business, and works with the business unit CRO and business unit OCA to facilitate implementation of the above programs. This includes coverage of operational risks related to core insurance activities, investing, model risk, technology (including cyber security, identify and access management, data privacy and data security), third-party providers, as well as compliance and regulatory matters. Based on the results of the risk identification and assessment efforts above, business leaders are accountable for tracking and remediating identified issues in line with our risk-monitoring procedures. Governance committees support these efforts and promote transparency enabling improved management decision making.\n",
      "An integrated risk and control framework facilitates the identification and mitigation of operational risk issues. To accomplish this, our integrated risk and control framework is designed to:\n",
      "• ensure first line accountability and ownership of risks and controls;\n",
      "• promote role clarity among the business and risk and control functions;\n",
      "• enhance transparency, risk management governance and culture;\n",
      "• foster greater consistency in identifying, measuring and ranking material risks;\n",
      "• proactively address potential risk issues and assign clear ownership and accountability for risk treatment; and\n",

      "Insurance Risks\n",
      "Insurance risk is defined as risk arising from the uncertainty around the actual experience and/or policyholder behavior being materially different than expected at the inception of an insurance contract. These uncertainties include the amount and timing of cash flows from premiums, commissions, expenses, claims and claim settlement expenses paid or received under a contract.\n",
      "Except as described above, we manage our business risk oversight activities through our insurance operations. A primary goal in managing our insurance operations is to achieve an acceptable risk-adjusted return on equity. To achieve this goal, we must be disciplined in risk selection, premium adequacy, and appropriate terms and conditions to cover the risk accepted.\n",
      "We operate our insurance businesses on a global basis, and we are exposed to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. We manage these risks throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of procedures:\n",
      "• pre-launch approval of product design, development and distribution;\n",
      "• underwriting approval processes and authorities;\n",
      "• exposure limits with ongoing monitoring;\n",

      "• compliance with financial reporting and capital and solvency targets;\n",
      "• use of reinsurance, both internal and third-party; and\n",
      "• review and challenge of reserves to ensure comprehensive analysis with established escalation procedures to provide appropriate transparency in reserving decisions and judgments made in the establishment of reserves.\n",
      "We closely manage insurance risk by monitoring and controlling the nature and geographic location of the risks in each line of business underwritten, the terms and conditions of the underwriting and the premiums we charge for taking on the risk. We analyze concentrations of risk using various modeling techniques, including both probability distributions (stochastic) and/or single-point estimates (deterministic) approaches.\n",
      "Risk Identification\n",
      "• General Insurance companies - risks covered include property, casualty, fidelity/surety, accident and health, aviation, and management liability. We manage risks in the General Insurance business through aggregations and limitations of concentrations at multiple levels: policy, line of business, geography, industry and legal entity.\n",
      "• Life and Retirement companies - risks include mortality and morbidity in the insurance-oriented products and insufficient cash flows to cover contract liabilities and longevity risk in the retirement savings-oriented products. We manage risks through product design, sound medical and non-medical underwriting, and external reinsurance programs.\n",
      "We purchase reinsurance for our insurance operations. Reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. We may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis. Pooling of our reinsurance risks enables us to purchase reinsurance more efficiently at a consolidated level, manage global counterparty risk and relationships and manage global catastrophe risks.\n",

      "Stochastic methods. Stochastic methods are used to measure and monitor risks including natural catastrophe, reserve and premium risk. We develop probabilistic estimates of risk based on our exposures, historical observed volatility or industry-recognized models in the case of catastrophe risk.\n",
      "Scenario analysis. Scenario or deterministic analysis is used to measure and monitor risks such as terrorism or to estimate losses due to man-made catastrophic scenarios.\n",
      "In addition, we monitor concentrations of exposure through insurance limits aggregated along dimensions such as geography, industry, or counterparty.\n",
      "The risk monitoring responsibilities of the business units include ensuring compliance with insurance risk limits and escalation and remediation of limit breaches. Such activities are reported to management by the relevant business unit for informative decision-making on a regular basis. This monitoring approach is aligned with our overall risk limits framework.\n",
      "Risk limits have a consistent framework used across AIG, its business units, and legal entities. This includes escalation thresholds in cases where measurement is particularly challenging.\n",

      "General Insurance Companies’ Key Risks\n",
      "We manage our risks through risk review and selection processes, exposure limitations, exclusions, deductibles, self-insured retentions, coverage limits, attachment points, and reinsurance. This management is supported by sound underwriting practices, pricing procedures and the use of actuarial analysis to help determine overall adequacy of provisions for insurance. Underwriting practices and pricing procedures incorporate historical experience, changes in underlying exposure, current regulation and judicial decisions as well as proposed or anticipated regulatory changes.\n",
      "For General Insurance companies, risks primarily include the following:\n",
      "• Loss Reserves - The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the General Insurance companies. There is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. We manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. For further information see Critical Accounting Estimates - Insurance Liabilities - Loss Reserves herein.\n",
      "• Underwriting - The potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the General Insurance companies’ ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. This may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, worse than expected prepayment of policies, investment results, or unexpected or increased costs or expenses.\n",
      "• Catastrophe Exposure - Our business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect our operating results. Other risks, such as man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n",
      "• Single Risk Loss Exposure - Our business is exposed to loss events that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. Events such as fires or explosions can result in loss activity for our clients. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by our GRC through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance. Furthermore, single risk loss exposure is managed and monitored on both a segregated and aggregated basis.\n",
      "• Reinsurance - Since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated. The inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n",
      "Natural Catastrophe Risk\n",
      "We manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate Probable Maximum Loss (PML) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.\n",
      "We use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. We apply a proprietary multi-model approach to account for relative strengths and weaknesses of vendor models, and make adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.\n",
      "We perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model weaknesses, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. Lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts that allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.\n",
      "We recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policy to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. For example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process.

      "Our natural catastrophe exposure is primarily driven by the U.S. and Japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries. For example, we have exposures to additional perils such as European windstorms and floods and seismic events across the Pacific Rim. Within the U.S., we have significant hurricane exposure in Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, the Northeast U.S. and mid-Atlantic regions. Events impacting the Northeast U.S. and the mid-Atlantic may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in those regions. Within the U.S., we have significant earthquake exposure in California, the Pacific Northwest and New Madrid regions. Earthquakes impacting the Pacific Northwest and New Madrid regions may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in these regions.\n",

      "The OEP estimates provided above reflect our in-force portfolios at September 30, 2017, for both U.S. and Japan exposures. The catastrophe reinsurance program is as of January 1, 2018.\n",
      "AIG, along with other property casualty insurance and reinsurance companies, uses industry-recognized catastrophe models and applies proprietary modeling processes and assumptions to arrive at loss estimates. The use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially change the projected losses. Since there is no industry standard for assumptions and preparation of insured data for use in these models, our modeled losses may not be comparable to estimates made by other companies.\n",
      "Also, the modeled results are based on the assumption that all reinsurers fulfill their obligations to us under the terms of the reinsurance arrangements and all catastrophe bonds attach and pay as modeled. However, reinsurance recoverable may not be fully collectible. In particular, the use of catastrophe bonds may not provide commensurate levels of protection compared to traditional reinsurance transactions. Therefore, these estimates are inherently uncertain and may not accurately reflect our exposure to these events.\n",
      "Our 2018 catastrophe reinsurance program provides protection on both an aggregate and occurrence basis with respect to North American exposures including United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.\n",
      "• Aggregate protection protects us against a high frequency of losses from certain events including windstorm, severe convective storm, earthquake, wildfire, and flood. Under this part of the program, AIG can recover up to $2.75 billion of aggregate losses in excess of $750 million. The event deductible is $100 million initially, but increases to $250 million for individual events greater than $750 million after the $750 million aggregate retention is exhausted. This protection will also cover a large event, providing coverage of up to $2 billion after the aggregate retention of $750 million is exhausted.\n",
      "• Occurrence protection is provided primarily on a $2 billion excess of $2 billion basis, with one reinstatement, with an additional $750 million excess of $4 billion on top of that but with no reinstatement. The $750 million excess of $4 billion layer is shared with the top $750 million layer of aggregate protections, such that, only a total of $750 million of limit is available across those two layers.\n",

      "Terrorism Risk\n",
      "We actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. We have set risk limits based on modeled losses from certain terrorism attack scenarios. Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model for various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the General Insurance companies’ exposures. Examples of modeled scenarios are conventional bombs of different sizes, anthrax attacks and nuclear attacks.\n",
      "Our largest terrorism exposures are in New York City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers’ Compensation lines of business. At our largest exposure location, modeled losses for a five-ton bomb attack net of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIP) and reinsurance recoveries are estimated to be $2.4 billion as of September 30, 2017.\n",
      "Our exposure to terrorism risk in the U.S. is mitigated by TRIP in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIP covers terrorist attacks within the United States or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law. In 2018, TRIP covers 82 percent of insured losses above a deductible, decreasing by one percent each year to 80 percent in 2020. The current estimate of our deductible is approximately $2.2 billion for 2017.\n",
      "We offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks.

      "Life and Retirement Companies’ Key Risks\n",
      "We manage risk through product design, experience monitoring, pricing actions, risk limitations, reinsurance and active monitoring and management of the relationships between assets and liabilities, including hedging.\n",
      "For Life and Retirement companies, risks include the following:\n",
      "• Longevity risk - represents the risk of a change in value of a policy or benefit as a result of actual mortality rates being lower than the expected mortality rates. This risk could arise from longer-term societal health changes as well as other factors. This risk exists in a number of our product lines but is most significant for our pension risk transfer, structured settlement, and annuity products.\n",
      "• Morbidity risk - represents the risk arising from actual morbidity (i.e,. illness, disability or disease) incidence being higher than expected or the length of the claims extending longer than expected resulting in a higher overall benefit payout. This risk could arise from longer-term medical advances in detection and treatment for various diseases and medical conditions, as well as other factors. This risk exists in certain product lines such as group benefits, health and long-term care businesses.\n",
      "• Mortality risk - represents the risk of loss arising from actual mortality rates being higher than expected mortality rates. This risk could arise from pandemics or other events, including longer-term societal changes that cause higher-than-expected mortality. This risk exists in a number of our product lines, but is most significant for our life insurance products.\n",
      "• Policyholder behavior risk including full and partial surrender/lapse risk - represents the risk that actual policyholder behavior differs from expected behavior in a manner that has an adverse effect on our operating results. There are many related assumptions made when products are sold, including how long the contracts will persist and other assumptions which impact the expected utilization of contract benefits and features. Actual experience can vary significantly from these assumptions. This risk is impacted by a number of factors including changes in market conditions, especially changes in the levels of interest rate and equity markets, tax law, regulations, competitive landscape and policyholder preferences. This risk exists in the majority of our product lines.\n",
      "The emergence of significant adverse experience compared to the initial assumptions at policy issuance or updated assumption would require an adjustment to DAC and benefit reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for a particular period.\n",
      "For additional discussion of the impact of actual and expected experience on DAC and benefit reserves see Critical Accounting Estimates - Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health Insurance Contracts and Critical Accounting Estimates - Guaranteed Benefit Features of Variable Annuity Products. For additional discussion of business risks see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Business and Operations.\n",

      "Variable Annuity Risk Management and Hedging Programs\n",
      "Our Individual and Group Retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with GMWB riders that guarantee a certain level of benefits. GMWB guaranteed living benefits are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses). GMWB features subject the Life and Retirement companies to market risk, including exposure to changes in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility.\n",
      "Variable annuity product design is the first step in managing our exposure to these market risks. Risk mitigation features of our variable annuity product design include GMWB rider fees indexed to an equity market volatility index, which can provide additional fee assessments in periods of increased market volatility, required minimum allocations to fixed accounts to reduce overall equity exposure, and the utilization of volatility control funds, which reduce equity exposure in the funds in response to changes in market volatility, even under sudden or extreme market movements.\n",
      "After reflecting our product risk-mitigating features, we hedge our remaining economic exposure to market risk within GMWB features through our variable annuity hedging program, which is designed to offset certain changes in the economic value of these GMWB embedded derivatives, within established thresholds. The hedging program is designed to provide additional protection against large and combined movements in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility under multiple scenarios.\n",
      "Our hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents our estimate of the underlying economic risks in our GMWB riders, based on the present value of the future expected benefit payments for the GMWB, less the present value of future rider fees, over numerous stochastic scenarios. This stochastic projection method uses best estimate assumptions for policyholder behavior (including mortality, lapses, withdrawals and benefit utilization) in conjunction with market scenarios calibrated to observable equity and interest rate option prices. Policyholder behaviors are regularly evaluated to compare current assumptions to actual experience and, if appropriate, changes are made to the policyholder behavior assumptions. The risk of changes in policyholder behavior is not explicitly hedged and such differences between expected and actual policyholder behaviors will result in hedge ineffectiveness.\n",
      "Due to differences between the calculation of the economic hedge target and U.S. GAAP valuation of the embedded derivative, which include differences in the treatment of rider fees and exclusion of certain risk margins and other differences in discount rates, we expect relative movements in the economic hedge target and the U.S. GAAP embedded derivative valuation will vary over time with changes in equity markets, interest rates and credit spreads.\n",
      "For information on the impact on our consolidated pre-tax income from the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives and the hedging portfolio, as well as additional discussion of differences between the economic hedge target and the valuation of the embedded derivatives see Insurance Reserves - Life and Annuity Reserves and DAC - Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefits and Hedging Results.\n",
      "In designing our hedging portfolio for our variable annuity hedging program, we make assumptions and projections about the future performance of the underlying contract holder funds. To project future account value changes, we make assumptions about how each of the underlying funds will perform. We map the contract holder funds to a set of publicly traded indices that we believe best represent the liability to be hedged. Basis risk exists due to the variance between these assumptions and actual fund returns, which may result in variances between changes in the hedging portfolio and changes in the economic hedge target. Net hedge results and the cost of hedging are also impacted by differences between realized volatility and implied volatility.\n",
      "For index annuity and universal life products, we have a hedging program designed to manage the index crediting strategies associated with index annuity and index life products. This hedging program is designed to offset the economic risk with respect to the index returns for the current crediting rate reset period, and utilizes derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity index options and futures contracts. Similarly as with the variable annuities, there are differences between the calculation of the economic hedge target and U.S. GAAP valuation of the index annuity and index life embedded derivatives, which can lead to variances in their relative movements.\n",
      "To manage the capital market exposures embedded within the economic hedge target, we identify and hedge market sensitivities to changes in equity markets, interest rates, volatility and for variable annuities, credit spreads. Each hedge program purchases derivative instruments or securities having sensitivities that offset those in the economic hedge target, within internally defined threshold levels. Since the relative movements of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target vary over time or with market changes, the net exposure can be outside the threshold limits, and adjustments to the hedging portfolio are made periodically to return the net exposure to within threshold limits.\n",
      "Our hedging programs utilize various derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts, interest rate swaps and swaption contracts, as well as other hedging instruments. In addition, for variable annuities, we purchase certain fixed income securities and elect the fair value option as a capital efficient way to manage interest rate and credit spread exposures. To\n",

      "minimize counterparty credit risk, the majority of our derivative instrument hedges are implemented using exchange-traded futures and options, cleared through global exchanges. Over the counter derivatives are highly collateralized.\n",
      "The hedging programs are monitored on a daily basis to ensure that the economic hedge target and derivative portfolio are within the threshold limits, pursuant to the approved hedge strategy. Daily risk monitoring verifies that the net risk exposures, as measured through sensitivities to a large set of market shocks, are within the approved net risk exposure threshold limits. In addition, monthly stress tests are performed to determine the program’s effectiveness relative to the applicable limits, under an array of combined severe market stresses in equity prices, interest rates, volatility and credit spreads. Finally, hedge strategies are reviewed regularly to gauge their effectiveness in managing our market exposures in the context of our overall risk appetite.\n",
      "Reinsurance Activities\n",
      "Reinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss (Life and Non-Life) exposure related to certain events such as natural and man-made catastrophes or death events. Our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.\n",
      "Reinsurance markets include:\n",
      "• Traditional local and global reinsurance markets including those in the United States, Bermuda, London and Europe, accessed directly and through reinsurance intermediaries;\n",
      "• Capital markets through insurance-linked securities and collateralized reinsurance transactions, such as catastrophe bonds, sidecars and similar vehicles; and\n",
      "• Other insurers that engage in both direct and assumed reinsurance.\n",
      "The form of reinsurance we may choose from time to time will generally depend on whether we are seeking:\n",
      "• proportional reinsurance, whereby we cede a specified percentage of premiums and losses to reinsurers;\n",
      "• non-proportional or excess of loss reinsurance, whereby we cede all or a specified portion of losses in excess of a specified amount on a per risk, per occurrence (including catastrophe reinsurance) or aggregate basis; or\n",
      "• facultative contracts that reinsure individual policies.\n",
      "We continually evaluate the relative attractiveness of different forms of reinsurance contracts and different markets that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives.\n",
      "Reinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. However, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.\n",
      "In certain markets, we are required to participate on a proportional basis in reinsurance pools based on our relative share of direct writings in those markets. Such mandatory reinsurance generally covers higher-risk consumer exposures such as assigned-risk automobile and earthquake, as well as certain commercial exposures such as workers’ compensation.\n",
      "Reinsurance Recoverable\n",
      "AIG’s reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of:\n",
      "• Paid losses recoverable - balances due from reinsurers for losses and loss adjustment expenses paid by our subsidiaries and billed, but not yet collected.\n",
      "• Ceded loss reserves - ultimate ceded reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, including reserves for claims reported but not yet paid and estimates for IBNR.\n",
      "• Ceded reserves for unearned premiums.\n",
      "• Life and Annuity reinsurance recoverables (ceded policy and claim reserves).\n",
      "AIG | 2017 Form 10-K\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "At December 31, 2017, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $33.0 billion. These assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $1.4 billion, ceded loss reserves of $26.9 billion including reserves for incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $3.1 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverable of $1.6 billion. The methods used to estimate IBNR and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. These methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments are reflected in income. We believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at December 31, 2017 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. Actual losses may, however, differ from the reserves currently ceded.\n",
      "The Reinsurance Credit Department (RCD) conducts periodic detailed assessments of the financial strength and condition of current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic. The RCD monitors both the financial condition of reinsurers as well as the total reinsurance recoverable ceded to reinsurers, and sets limits with regard to the amount and type of exposure we are willing to take with reinsurers. As part of these assessments, we attempt to identify whether a reinsurer is appropriately licensed, assess its financial capacity and liquidity, and evaluate the local economic and financial environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates. The RCD reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for measures, including collateral to mitigate credit risk. For example, in our treaty reinsurance contracts, we frequently include provisions that require a reinsurer to post collateral or use other measures to reduce exposure when a referenced event occurs. Furthermore, we limit our unsecured exposure to reinsurers through the use of credit triggers such as insurer financial strength rating downgrades, declines in regulatory capital, or relevant risk-based capital (RBC) ratios fall below certain levels. We also set maximum limits for reinsurance recoverable exposure, which in some cases is the recoverable amount plus an estimate of the maximum potential exposure from unexpected events for a reinsurer. In addition, credit executives within ERM review reinsurer exposures and credit limits and approve reinsurer credit limits above specified levels. Finally, even where we conclude that uncollateralized credit risk is acceptable, we require collateral from active reinsurance counterparties where it is necessary for our subsidiaries to recognize the reinsurance recoverable assets for statutory accounting purposes. At December 31, 2017, we held $20.5 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers. We believe that no exposure to a single reinsurer represents an inappropriate concentration of risk to AIG, nor is our business substantially dependent upon any single reinsurance contract.\n",
      "The following table presents information for each reinsurer representing in excess of five percent of our total reinsurance recoverable assets:\n",
      "(a) The financial strength ratings reflect the ratings of the various reinsurance subsidiaries of the companies listed as of February 8, 2018.\n",
      "(b) Total reinsurance assets include both Property Casualty and Life and Retirement reinsurance recoverable.\n",
      "(c) Excludes collateral held in excess of applicable treaty balances.\n",
      "(d) Includes $13.2 billion recoverable under the 2011 retroactive asbestos reinsurance transaction and the 2017 Adverse Development Reinsurance agreement.\n",
      "At December 31, 2017, we had no significant reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. Reinsurer capital levels continued to increase in 2017, thereby increasing the industry’s underwriting capacity, which resulted in continued competition and lower rates for 2018 renewals. Reduced profitability associated with lower rates could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. The RCD, in conjunction with the credit executives within ERM, reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require the reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.\n",

Credit risk associated with derivative counterparties exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to us. The maximum potential exposure will increase or decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions. All derivative transactions must be transacted within counterparty limits that have been approved by ERM.\n",
      "We evaluate counterparty credit quality by internal analysis consistent with the AIG Credit Policy. We utilize various credit enhancements, including letters of credit, guarantees, collateral, credit triggers, credit derivatives, margin agreements and subordination to reduce the credit risk relating to outstanding financial derivative transactions. We require credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties, and transaction size and maturity. Furthermore, we enter into certain agreements that have the benefit of set-off and close-out netting provisions, such as ISDA Master Agreements. These provisions provide that, in the case of an early termination of a transaction, we can set off receivables from a counterparty against payables to the same counterparty arising out of all covered transactions. As a result, where a legally enforceable netting agreement exists, the fair value of the transaction with the counterparty represents the net sum of estimated fair values.\n",

      "In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of American International Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (AIG) at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, AIG maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). AIG’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A in the 2014 Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on AIG’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n",
      "A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n",
      "Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n",

      "American International Group, Inc. (AIG) is a leading global insurance organization serving customers in more than 100 countries and jurisdictions. AIG companies serve commercial, institutional and individual customers through one of the most extensive worldwide property-casualty networks of any insurer. In addition, AIG companies are leading providers of life insurance and retirement services in the United States. AIG Common Stock, par value $2.50 per share (AIG Common Stock), is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: AIG) and the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “AIG,” “we,” “us” or “our” mean American International Group, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries and the term “AIG Parent” means American International Group, Inc. and not any of its consolidated subsidiaries.\n",
      "The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AIG Parent, our controlled subsidiaries (generally through a greater than 50 percent ownership of voting rights of a voting interest entity), and variable interest entities (VIEs) of which we are the primary beneficiary. Equity investments in entities that we do not consolidate, including corporate entities in which we have significant influence and partnership and partnership-like entities in which we have more than minor influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for under the equity method unless we have elected the fair value option.\n",
      "Certain of our foreign subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements report on different annual fiscal year bases, in most cases ending November 30. The effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations of all material events occurring at these subsidiaries between such fiscal year end and December 31st for all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements has been recorded.\n",

      "Policy fees related to features accounted for as embedded derivatives in variable annuity products, including guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits and guaranteed minimum account value benefits, are included in the fair value measurement of embedded derivatives. Effective December 31, 2014, we reclassified fees related to these embedded derivatives to Net realized capital gains, with no effect to the fair value measurement of the embedded derivatives, Income from continuing operations, Net income attributable to AIG, or Shareholders’ equity. Accordingly, a portion of prior period policy fees have been reclassified to Net realized capital gains to conform to the current period presentation. See Note 14 herein for our accounting policy and Note 5 for a discussion of the fair value measurement of embedded policy derivatives, including policy on classification of fees.\n",
      "Revisions were made to change the classification of certain miscellaneous income from General operating and other expenses to Premiums and of certain broker-dealer fees from General operating and other expenses to Other income, to conform with the current period presentation, with no effect to Income from continuing operations or Net income attributable to AIG.\n",
      "Sale of ILFC\n",
      "On May 14, 2014, we completed the sale of 100 percent of the common stock of International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) to AerCap Ireland Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of AerCap Holdings N.V. (AerCap), in exchange for total consideration of approximately $7.6 billion, including cash and 97.6 million newly issued AerCap common shares (the AerCap Transaction). The total value of the consideration was based in part on AerCap’s closing price per share of $47.01 on May 13, 2014. ILFC’s results of operations are reflected in Aircraft leasing revenue and Aircraft leasing expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income through the date of the completion of the sale. ILFC’s assets and liabilities were classified as held-for-sale at December 31, 2013 in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 4 herein for further discussion.\n",

      "Use of Estimates\n",
      "The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. Accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions are considered our critical accounting estimates and are related to the determination of:\n",
      "• classification of ILFC as held for sale and related fair value measurement for applicable years;\n",
      "• income tax assets and liabilities, including recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset;\n",

      "• liability for legal contingencies; and\n",
      "• fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities.\n",
      "These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected.\n",

      "Premiums for short-duration contracts are recorded as written on the inception date of the policy. Premiums are earned primarily on a pro rata basis over the term of the related coverage. Sales of extended services contracts are reflected as premiums written and earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the related coverage. In addition, certain miscellaneous income is included as premiums written and earned. The reserve for unearned premiums includes the portion of premiums written relating to the unexpired terms of coverage. Reinsurance premiums are typically earned over the same period as the underlying policies or risks covered by the contract. As a result, the earnings pattern of a reinsurance contract may extend up to 24 months, reflecting the inception dates of the underlying policies throughout the year.\n",
      "Reinsurance premiums ceded are recognized as a reduction in revenues over the period the reinsurance coverage is provided in proportion to the risks to which the premiums relate.\n",
      "Premiums for long-duration insurance products and life contingent annuities are recognized as revenues when due. Estimates for premiums due but not yet collected are accrued.\n",
      "Policy fees represent fees recognized from universal life and investment-type products consisting of policy charges for the cost of insurance, policy administration charges, surrender charges and amortization of unearned revenue reserves.\n",
      "Aircraft leasing revenue from flight equipment under operating leases, through May 14, 2014, the date of disposal of ILFC, was recognized over the life of the leases as rental payments became receivable under the provisions of the leases or, in the case of leases with varying payments, under the straight-line method over the noncancelable term of the leases. In certain cases, leases provided for additional payments contingent on usage. In those cases, rental revenue was recognized at the time such usage occurred, net of estimated future contractual aircraft maintenance reimbursements. Gains on sales of flight equipment were recognized when flight equipment was sold and the risk of ownership of the equipment passed to the new owner.\n",
      "Other income includes unrealized gains and losses on derivatives, including income from the Direct Investment book (DIB) unrealized market valuation gains and losses associated with the Global Capital Markets (GCM) super senior credit default swap (CDS) portfolio, advisory fee income from the Consumer Insurance broker dealer business, as well as legal settlements of $804 million, $1.2 billion and $200 million from legacy crisis and other matters in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\n",
      "Other income from our Corporate and Other category consists of the following:\n",
      "• Change in fair value relating to financial assets and liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected.\n",
      "• Interest income and related expenses, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on bonds with changes in the timing and the amount of expected principal and interest cash flows reflected in the yield, as applicable.\n",
      "• Dividend income from common and preferred stock and distributions from other investments.\n",
      "• Changes in the fair value of other securities sold but not yet purchased, futures, hybrid financial instruments, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase.\n",
      "Item 8 / note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n",
      "• Income earned on real estate based investments and related realized gains and losses from sales, property level impairments and financing costs.\n",
      "• Exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions.\n",
      "• Earnings from private equity funds and hedge fund investments accounted for under the equity method.\n",
      "• Gains and losses recognized in earnings on derivatives for the effective portion and their related hedged items.\n",
      "Aircraft leasing expenses through May 14, 2014, the date of disposal of ILFC, consisted of ILFC interest expense, depreciation expense, impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease-related charges on aircraft as well as selling, general and administrative expenses and other expenses incurred by ILFC.\n",
      "Cash represents cash on hand and non-interest- bearing demand deposits.\n",
      "Premiums and other receivables - net of allowance include premium balances receivable, amounts due from agents and brokers and policyholders, trade receivables for the DIB and GCM and other receivables. Trade receivables for GCM include cash collateral posted to derivative counterparties that is not eligible to be netted against derivative liabilities. The allowance for doubtful accounts on premiums and other receivables was $428 million and $554 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n",
      "Other assets consist of sales inducement assets, prepaid expenses, deposits, other deferred charges, real estate, other fixed assets, capitalized software costs, goodwill, intangible assets other than goodwill, and restricted cash.\n",
      "We offer sales inducements which include enhanced crediting rates or bonus payments to contract holders (bonus interest) on certain annuity and investment contract products. Sales inducements provided to the contract holder are recognized in Policyholder contract deposits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such amounts are deferred and amortized over the life of the contract using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize DAC (see Note 9 herein). To qualify for such accounting treatment, the bonus interest must be explicitly identified in the contract at inception. We must also demonstrate that such amounts are incremental to amounts we credit on similar contracts without bonus interest, and are higher than the contract’s expected ongoing crediting rates for periods after the bonus period. The deferred bonus interest and other deferred sales inducement assets totaled $629 million and $703 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The amortization expense associated with these assets is reported within Interest credited to policyholder account balances in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Such amortization expense totaled $63 million, $102 million and $162 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\n",
      "The cost of buildings and furniture and equipment is depreciated principally on the straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (maximum of 40 years for buildings and 10 years for furniture and equipment). Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred and expenditures for improvements are capitalized and depreciated. We periodically assess the carrying amount of our real estate for purposes of determining any asset impairment. Capitalized software costs, which represent costs directly related to obtaining, developing or upgrading internal use software, are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over a period generally not exceeding five years. Real estate, fixed assets and other long-lived assets are assessed for impairment when impairment indicators exist.\n",
      "Separate accounts represent funds for which investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to the policyholders who bear the investment risk. Each account has specific investment objectives and the assets are carried at fair value. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise from any of our other businesses. The liabilities for these accounts are equal to the account assets. For a more detailed discussion of separate accounts, see Note 14 herein.\n",
      "Other liabilities consist of other funds on deposit, other payables, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities sold but not yet purchased. We have entered into certain insurance and reinsurance contracts, primarily in our Non-Life Insurance Companies segment, that do not contain sufficient insurance risk to be accounted for as insurance or reinsurance. Accordingly, the premiums received on such contracts, after deduction for certain related expenses, are recorded as deposits within Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net proceeds of these deposits are invested and generate Net investment income. As amounts are paid, consistent with the underlying contracts, the deposit liability is reduced. Also included in Other liabilities are trade payables for the DIB and GCM, which include option premiums received and payables to counterparties that relate to unrealized gains and losses on futures, forwards, and options and balances due to\n",

      "Securities sold but not yet purchased represent sales of securities not owned at the time of sale. The obligations arising from such transactions are recorded on a trade-date basis and carried at fair value. Fair values of securities sold but not yet purchased are based on current market prices.\n",
      "Foreign currency: Financial statement accounts expressed in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars. Functional currency assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars generally using rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date of each respective subsidiary and the related translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of any related taxes, in Total AIG shareholders’ equity. Functional currencies are generally the currencies of the local operating environment. Financial statement accounts expressed in currencies other than the functional currency of a consolidated entity are translated into that entity’s functional currency. Income statement accounts expressed in functional currencies are translated using average exchange rates during the period. The adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign entities operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in income. Exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recorded in income.\n",
      "Accounting Standards Adopted During 2014\n",
      "Certain Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements\n",
      "In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standard that requires us to measure obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date as the sum of (i) the amount we agreed to pay on the basis of our arrangement among our co-obligors and (ii) any additional amount we expect to pay on behalf of our co-obligors.\n",
      "We adopted the standard on its required effective date of January 1, 2014. The adoption of this standard had no material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n",
      "Parent’s Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of an Investment within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity\n",
      "In March 2013, the FASB issued an accounting standard addressing whether consolidation guidance or foreign currency guidance applies to the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a parent sells all or a part of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or net assets that are a business (other than a sale of in-substance real estate) within a foreign entity. The standard also resolves the diversity in practice for the cumulative translation adjustment treatment in business combinations achieved in stages involving foreign entities.\n",
      "Under the standard, the entire amount of the cumulative translation adjustment associated with the foreign entity should be released into earnings when there has been: (i) a sale of a subsidiary or group of net assets within a foreign entity and the sale represents a complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or the net assets had resided; (ii) a loss of a controlling financial interest in an investment in a foreign entity; or (iii) a change in accounting method from applying the equity method to an investment in a foreign entity to consolidating the foreign entity.\n",
      "We adopted the standard on its required effective date of January 1, 2014 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this standard had no material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n",
      "Investment Company Guidance\n",
      "In June 2013, the FASB issued an accounting standard that amends the criteria a company must meet to qualify as an investment company, clarifies the measurement guidance, and requires new disclosures for investment companies. An entity that is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act)\n",
      "Item 8 / note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n",
      "qualifies as an investment company. Entities that are not regulated under the 1940 Act must have certain fundamental characteristics and must consider other characteristics to determine whether they qualify as investment companies. An entity’s purpose and design must be considered when making the assessment.\n",
      "An entity that no longer meets the requirements to be an investment company as a result of this standard should present the change in its status as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. An entity that is an investment company should apply the standard prospectively as an adjustment to opening net assets as of the effective date. The adjustment to net assets represents both the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the entity’s investments and any amount previously recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income.\n",
      "We adopted the standard on its required effective date of January 1, 2014 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this standard had no material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n",
      "Presentation of Unrecognized Tax Benefits\n",
      "In July 2013, the FASB issued an accounting standard that requires a liability related to unrecognized tax benefits to be presented as a reduction to the related deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward or a tax credit carryforward. When the carryforwards are not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit will be presented in the financial statements as a liability and will not be combined with the related deferred tax asset.\n",
      "We adopted the standard on its required effective date of January 1, 2014 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this standard had no material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n",
      "Future Application of Accounting Standards\n",
      "Reclassification of Residential Real Estate Collateralized Consumer Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure\n",
      "In January 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard that clarifies that a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan, so that the loan is derecognized and the real estate property is recognized, when either (i) the creditor obtains legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure or (ii) the borrower conveys all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy the loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement.\n",
      "The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014. Early adoption is permitted. We plan to adopt the standard on its required effective date of January 1, 2015 and do not expect the adoption of the standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n",
      "Reporting Discontinued Operations\n",
      "In April 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard that changes the requirements for presenting a component or group of components of an entity as a discontinued operation and requires new disclosures. Under the standard, the disposal of a component or group of components of an entity should be reported as a discontinued operation if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results. Disposals of equity method investments, or those reported as held-for-sale, must be presented as a discontinued operation if they meet the new definition. The standard also requires entities to provide disclosures about the disposal of an individually significant component of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations presentation.\n",
      "The standard is effective prospectively for all disposals of components (or classification of components as held-for-sale) of an entity that occur within interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014. Early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals (or classifications of components as held-for-sale) that have not been reported in financial statements\n",

      "previously issued. We plan to adopt the standard on its required effective date of January 1, 2015 and do not expect the adoption of the standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n",
      "Revenue Recognition\n",
      "In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard that supersedes most existing revenue recognition guidance. The standard excludes from its scope the accounting for insurance contracts, leases, financial instruments, and other agreements that are governed under other GAAP guidance, but affects the revenue recognition for certain of our other activities.\n",
      "The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and may be applied retrospectively or through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings at the date of adoption. Early adoption is not permitted. We plan to adopt the standard on its required effective date of January 1, 2017 and are assessing the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n",
      "Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures\n",
      "In June 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard that changes the accounting for repurchase-to-maturity transactions and repurchase financing arrangements. It also requires additional disclosures about repurchase agreements and other similar transactions. The standard aligns the accounting for repurchase-to-maturity transactions and repurchase agreements executed as a repurchase financing with the accounting for other typical repurchase agreements such that they all will be accounted for as secured borrowings. The standard eliminates sale accounting for repurchase-to-maturity transactions and supersedes the standard under which a transfer of a financial asset and a contemporaneous repurchase financing could be accounted for on a combined basis as a forward agreement.\n",
      "The accounting standard and new disclosure requirements for certain transactions accounted for as sales are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, while the disclosure requirements for transactions accounted for as secured borrowings are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014 and for interim reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2015. Early adoption is not permitted. We plan to adopt the standard on its required effective dates and do not expect the adoption of the standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n",
      "Accounting for Share-Based Payments with Performance Targets\n",
      "In June 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard that clarifies the accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period. The standard requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.\n",
      "The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The standard may be applied prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. We plan to adopt the standard on its required effective date of January 1, 2016 and do not expect the adoption of the standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n",
      "Measuring the Financial Assets and the Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity\n",
      "In August 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard that allows a reporting entity to measure the financial assets and financial liabilities of a qualifying consolidated collateralized financing entity using the fair value of either its financial assets or financial liabilities, whichever is more observable.\n",
      "Item 8 / note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n",
      "The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The standard may be applied retrospectively to all relevant prior periods presented starting with January 1, 2010 or through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings at the date of adoption. We plan to adopt the standard on its required effective date of January 1, 2016 and are assessing the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows\n",
      "Consolidation: Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis\n",
      "In February 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard that affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. Specifically, the amendments modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities; eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership; affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships; and provide a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds.\n",
      "The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The standard may be applied retrospectively or through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. We plan to adopt the standard on its required effective date of January 1, 2016 and are assessing the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n",
      "3. SEGMENT INFORMATION\n",
      "In the fourth quarter of 2014, we completed our previously announced reorganization and modified the presentation of our financial results to reflect our new operating structure. The new operating structure includes two reportable segments - Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance - and a Corporate and Other category. The Corporate and Other category consists of businesses and items not allocated to our reportable segments.\n",

      "Held-For-Sale Classification\n",
      "We report a business as held for sale when management has approved or received approval to sell the business and is committed to a formal plan, the business is available for immediate sale, the business is being actively marketed, the sale is anticipated to occur during the next 12 months and certain other specified criteria are met. A business classified as held for sale is recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. If the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value, a loss is recognized. Depreciation and amortization expense is not recorded on assets of a business after it is classified as held for sale. Assets and liabilities related to a business classified as held for sale are segregated in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in the period in which the business is classified as held for sale.\n",
      "The following table summarizes the components of ILFC assets and liabilities held-for-sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2013:\n",
      "International Lease Finance Corporation\n",
      "On May 14, 2014, we completed the sale of 100 percent of the common stock of ILFC to AerCap Ireland Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of AerCap, in exchange for total consideration of approximately $7.6 billion, including cash and 97.6 million newly issued AerCap common shares, valued at approximately $4.6 billion based on AerCap’s closing price per share of $47.01 on May 13, 2014. Net cash proceeds to AIG were $2.4 billion after the settlement of intercompany loans, and AIG recorded pre-tax and after-tax gains of approximately $2.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, for the year ended December\n",
      "Item 8 / note 3. SEGMENT INFORMATION\n",
      "31, 2014. In connection with the AerCap Transaction, we entered into a five-year credit agreement for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility between AerCap Ireland Capital Limited, as borrower, and AIG Parent as lender (the Revolving Credit Facility). The Revolving Credit Facility provides for an aggregate commitment of $1.0 billion and permits loans for general corporate purposes after the closing of the AerCap Transaction. At December 31, 2014, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.\n",
      "As a result of the AerCap Transaction, we own approximately 46 percent of the outstanding common stock of AerCap. This common stock is subject to certain restrictions as to the amount and timing of potential sales as set forth in the Stockholders’ Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement between AIG and AerCap. We account for our interest in AerCap using the equity method of accounting. The difference between the carrying amount of our investment in AerCap common stock and our share of the underlying equity in the net assets of AerCap was approximately $1.4 billion at December 31, 2014. Approximately $0.4 billion of this difference was allocated to the assets and liabilities of AerCap based on their respective fair values and is being amortized into income over the estimated lives of the related assets and liabilities. The remainder was allocated to goodwill.\n",
      "ILFC’s results of operations are reflected in Aircraft leasing revenue and Aircraft leasing expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income through the date of the completion of the sale. ILFC’s assets and liabilities were classified as held-for-sale at December 31, 2013 in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n",

      "5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n",
      "Fair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis\n",
      "We carry certain of our financial instruments at fair value. We define the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We are responsible for the determination of the value of the investments carried at fair value and the supporting methodologies and assumptions.\n",
      "The degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally inversely correlates with the level of observable valuation inputs. We maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when\n",
      "Item 8 / note 4. HELD-FOR-SALE CLASSIFICATION AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n",
      "measuring fair value. Financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment is used in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments for which no quoted prices are available have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models or other pricing techniques that require more judgment. Pricing observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established, the characteristics specific to the transaction, liquidity and general market conditions.\n",
      "Fair Value Hierarchy\n",
      "Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are measured and classified in accordance with a fair value hierarchy consisting of three “levels” based on the observability of valuation inputs:\n",
      "• Level 1: Fair value measurements based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that we have the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. Market price data generally is obtained from exchange or dealer markets. We do not adjust the quoted price for such instruments.\n",
      "• Level 2: Fair value measurements based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.\n",
      "• Level 3: Fair value measurements based on valuation techniques that use significant inputs that are unobservable. Both observable and unobservable inputs may be used to determine the fair values of positions classified in Level 3. The circumstances for using these measurements include those in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Therefore, we must make certain assumptions about the inputs a hypothetical market participant would use to value that asset or liability. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\n",
      "The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments carried at fair value. These methodologies are applied to assets and liabilities across the levels discussed above, and it is the observability of the inputs used that determines the appropriate level in the fair value hierarchy for the respective asset or liability.\n",
      "Valuation Methodologies of Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value\n",
      "Incorporation of Credit Risk in Fair Value Measurements\n",
      "• Our Own Credit Risk. Fair value measurements for certain liabilities incorporate our own credit risk by determining the explicit cost for each counterparty to protect against its net credit exposure to us at the balance sheet date by reference to observable AIG CDS or cash bond spreads. A derivative counterparty’s net credit exposure to us is determined based on master netting agreements, when applicable, which take into consideration all derivative positions with us, as well as collateral we post with the counterparty at the balance sheet date. We calculate the effect of these credit spread changes using discounted cash flow techniques that incorporate current market interest rates.\n",
      "• Counterparty Credit Risk. Fair value measurements for freestanding derivatives incorporate counterparty credit by determining the explicit cost for us to protect against our net credit exposure to each counterparty at the balance sheet date by reference to observable counterparty CDS spreads, when available. When not available, other directly or indirectly observable credit spreads will be used to derive the best estimates of the counterparty spreads. Our net credit exposure to a counterparty is determined based on master netting agreements, which take into consideration all derivative positions with the counterparty, as well as collateral posted by the counterparty at the balance sheet date.\n",
      "Fair values for fixed maturity securities based on observable market prices for identical or similar instruments implicitly incorporate counterparty credit risk. Fair values for fixed maturity securities based on internal models incorporate counterparty\n",
      "Item 8 / note 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n",
      "credit risk by using discount rates that take into consideration cash issuance spreads for similar instruments or other observable information.\n",
      "The cost of credit protection is determined under a discounted present value approach considering the market levels for single name CDS spreads for each specific counterparty, the mid market value of the net exposure (reflecting the amount of protection required) and the weighted average life of the net exposure. CDS spreads are provided to us by an independent third party. We utilize an interest rate based on the benchmark London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) curve to derive our discount rates.\n",
      "While this approach does not explicitly consider all potential future behavior of the derivative transactions or potential future changes in valuation inputs, we believe this approach provides a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets and liabilities, including consideration of the impact of non-performance risk.\n",
      "Fixed Maturity Securities\n",
      "Whenever available, we obtain quoted prices in active markets for identical assets at the balance sheet date to measure fixed maturity securities at fair value. Market price data is generally obtained from dealer markets.\n",
      "We employ independent third-party valuation service providers to gather, analyze, and interpret market information to derive fair value estimates for individual investments, based upon market-accepted methodologies and assumptions. The methodologies used by these independent third-party valuation service providers are reviewed and understood by management, through periodic discussion with and information provided by the independent third-party valuation service providers. In addition, as discussed further below, control processes are applied to the fair values received from independent third-party valuation service providers to ensure the accuracy of these values.\n",
      "Valuation service providers typically obtain data about market transactions and other key valuation model inputs from multiple sources and, through the use of market-accepted valuation methodologies, which may utilize matrix pricing, financial models, accompanying model inputs and various assumptions, provide a single fair value measurement for individual securities. The inputs used by the valuation service providers include, but are not limited to, market prices from completed transactions for identical securities and transactions for comparable securities, benchmark yields, interest rate yield curves, credit spreads, prepayment rates, default rates, currency rates, quoted prices for similar securities and other market-observable information, as applicable. If fair value is determined using financial models, these models generally take into account, among other things, market observable information as of the measurement date as well as the specific attributes of the security being valued, including its term, interest rate, credit rating, industry sector, and when applicable, collateral quality and other security or issuer-specific information. When market transactions or other market observable data is limited, the extent to which judgment is applied in determining fair value is greatly increased.\n",
      "We have control processes designed to ensure that the fair values received from independent third-party valuation service providers are accurately recorded, that their data inputs and valuation techniques are appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions used appear reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value. We assess the reasonableness of individual security values received from independent third-party valuation service providers through various analytical techniques, and have procedures to escalate related questions internally and to the independent third-party valuation service providers for resolution. To assess the degree of pricing consensus among various valuation service providers for specific asset types, we conduct comparisons of prices received from available sources. We use these comparisons to establish a hierarchy for the fair values received from independent third-party valuation service providers to be used for particular security classes. We also validate prices for selected securities through reviews by members of management who have relevant expertise and who are independent of those charged with executing investing transactions.\n",
      "When our independent third-party valuation service providers are unable to obtain sufficient market observable information upon which to estimate the fair value for a particular security, fair value is determined either by requesting brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities to provide a price quote, which is generally non-binding, or by employing market accepted valuation models. Broker prices may be based on an income approach, which converts expected future cash flows to a single present value amount, with specific consideration of inputs relevant to particular security types. For structured securities, such inputs may include ratings, collateral types, geographic concentrations, underlying loan vintages, loan delinquencies and defaults, prepayments, and weighted average coupons and maturities. When the volume or level of market\n",
      "Item 8 / note 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n",
      "activity for a security is limited, certain inputs used to determine fair value may not be observable in the market. Broker prices may also be based on a market approach that considers recent transactions involving identical or similar securities. Fair values provided by brokers are subject to similar control processes to those noted above for fair values from independent third-party valuation service providers, including management reviews. For those corporate debt instruments (for example, private placements) that are not traded in active markets or that are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations reflect illiquidity and non-transferability, based on available market evidence. When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow models using discount rates based on credit spreads, yields or price levels of comparable securities, adjusted for illiquidity and structure. Fair values determined internally are also subject to management review to ensure that valuation models and related inputs are reasonable.\n",
      "The methodology above is relevant for all fixed maturity securities including residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS), commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS), collateralized debt obligations (CDO), other asset-backed securities (ABS) and fixed maturity securities issued by government sponsored entities and corporate entities.\n",
      "Equity Securities Traded in Active Markets\n",
      "Whenever available, we obtain quoted prices in active markets for identical assets at the balance sheet date to measure equity securities at fair value. Market price data is generally obtained from exchange or dealer markets.\n",
      "Mortgage and Other Loans Receivable\n",
      "We estimate the fair value of mortgage and other loans receivable that are measured at fair value by using dealer quotations, discounted cash flow analyses and/or internal valuation models. The determination of fair value considers inputs such as interest rate, maturity, the borrower’s creditworthiness, collateral, subordination, guarantees, past-due status, yield curves, credit curves, prepayment rates, market pricing for comparable loans and other relevant factors.\n",
      "Other Invested Assets\n",
      "We initially estimate the fair value of investments in certain hedge funds, private equity funds and other investment partnerships by reference to the transaction price. Subsequently, we generally obtain the fair value of these investments from net asset value information provided by the general partner or manager of the investments, the financial statements of which are generally audited annually. We consider observable market data and perform certain control procedures to validate the appropriateness of using the net asset value as a fair value measurement. The fair values of other investments carried at fair value, such as direct private equity holdings, are initially determined based on transaction price and are subsequently estimated based on available evidence such as market transactions in similar instruments, other financing transactions of the issuer and other available financial information for the issuer, with adjustments made to reflect illiquidity as appropriate.\n",
      "Short-term Investments\n",
      "For short-term investments that are measured at amortized cost, the carrying amounts of these assets approximate fair values because of the relatively short period of time between origination and expected realization, and their limited exposure to credit risk. Securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repurchase agreements) are generally treated as collateralized receivables. We report certain receivables arising from securities purchased under agreements to resell as Short-term investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. When these receivables are measured at fair value, we use market-observable interest rates to determine fair value.\n",
      "Separate Account Assets\n",
      "Separate account assets are composed primarily of registered and unregistered open-end mutual funds that generally trade daily and are measured at fair value in the manner discussed above for equity securities traded in active markets.\n",
      "Item 8 / note 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n",
      "Freestanding Derivatives\n",
      "Derivative assets and liabilities can be exchange-traded or traded over-the-counter (OTC). We generally value exchange-traded derivatives such as futures and options using quoted prices in active markets for identical derivatives at the balance sheet date.\n",
      "OTC derivatives are valued using market transactions and other market evidence whenever possible, including market-based inputs to models, model calibration to market clearing transactions, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. When models are used, the selection of a particular model to value an OTC derivative depends on the contractual terms of, and specific risks inherent in the instrument, as well as the availability of pricing information in the market. We generally use similar models to value similar instruments. Valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs. For OTC derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards, swaps and options, model inputs can generally be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means, and model selection does not involve significant management judgment.\n",
      "For certain OTC derivatives that trade in less liquid markets, where we generally do not have corroborating market evidence to support significant model inputs and cannot verify the model to market transactions, the transaction price may provide the best estimate of fair value. Accordingly, when a pricing model is used to value such an instrument, the model is adjusted so the model value at inception equals the transaction price. We will update valuation inputs in these models only when corroborated by evidence such as similar market transactions, independent third-party valuation service providers and/or broker or dealer quotations, or other empirical market data. When appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity, bid/offer spreads and credit considerations. Such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management’s best estimate is used.\n",
      "Embedded Policy Derivatives\n",
      "Certain variable annuity and equity-indexed annuity and life contracts contain embedded policy derivatives that we bifurcate from the host contracts and account for separately at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. These embedded derivatives are classified within Policyholder contract deposits. We have concluded these contracts contain (i) written option guarantees on minimum accumulation value, (ii) a series of written options that guarantee withdrawals from the highest anniversary value within a specific period or for life, or (iii) equity-indexed written options that meet the criteria of derivatives that must be bifurcated.\n",
      "The fair value of embedded policy derivatives contained in certain variable annuity and equity-indexed annuity and life contracts is measured based on actuarial and capital market assumptions related to projected cash flows over the expected lives of the contracts. These cash flow estimates primarily include benefits and related fees assessed, when applicable, and incorporate expectations about policyholder behavior. Estimates of future policyholder behavior are subjective and based primarily on our historical experience.\n",
      "With respect to embedded policy derivatives in our variable annuity contracts, because of the dynamic and complex nature of the expected cash flows, risk neutral valuations are used. Estimating the underlying cash flows for these products involves judgments regarding expected market rates of return, market volatility, correlations of market variables to funds, fund performance, discount rates and policyholder behavior. The portion of fees attributable to the fair value of expected benefit payments are included within the fair value measurement of these embedded policy derivatives and related fees are classified in net realized gain/loss as collected consistent with other changes in the fair value of these embedded policy derivatives. Any additional fees not attributed to the embedded derivative are excluded from the fair value measurement and classified in policy fees as collected.\n",
      "With respect to embedded policy derivatives in our equity-indexed annuity and life contracts, option pricing models are used to estimate fair value, taking into account assumptions for future equity index growth rates, volatility of the equity index, future interest rates, and determinations on adjusting the participation rate and the cap on equity-indexed credited rates in light of market conditions and policyholder behavior assumptions. These methodologies incorporate an explicit risk margin to take into consideration market participant estimates of projected cash flows and policyholder behavior.\n",
      "Item 8 / note 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n",
      "We also incorporate our own risk of non-performance in the valuation of the embedded policy derivatives associated with variable annuity and equity-indexed annuity and life contracts. Expected cash flows are discounted using the interest rate swap curve (swap curve), which is commonly viewed as being consistent with the credit spreads for highly-rated financial institutions (S&P AA-rated or above). A swap curve shows the fixed-rate leg of a non-complex swap against the floating rate (for example, LIBOR) leg of a related tenor. The non-performance risk adjustment reflects a market participant’s view of our claims-paying ability by incorporating an additional spread to the swap curve used to value embedded policy derivatives.\n",
      "Super Senior Credit Default Swap Portfolio\n",
      "We value CDS transactions written on the super senior risk layers of designated pools of debt securities or loans using internal valuation models, third-party price estimates and market indices. The principal market was determined to be the market in which super senior CDSs of this type and size would be transacted, or have been transacted, with the greatest volume or level of activity. We have determined that the principal market participants, therefore, would consist of other large financial institutions who participate in sophisticated over-the-counter derivatives markets. The specific valuation methodologies vary based on the nature of the referenced obligations and availability of market prices.\n",
      "The valuation of the super senior credit derivatives is complex because of the limited availability of market observable information due to the lack of trading and price transparency in certain structured finance markets. These market conditions have increased the reliance on management estimates and judgments in arriving at an estimate of fair value for financial reporting purposes. Further, disparities in the valuation methodologies employed by market participants and the varying judgments reached by such participants when assessing volatile markets have increased the likelihood that the various parties to these instruments may arrive at significantly different estimates of their fair values.\n",
      "Our valuation methodologies for the super senior CDS portfolio have evolved over time in response to market conditions and the availability of market observable information. We have sought to calibrate the methodologies to available market information and to review the assumptions of the methodologies on a regular basis.\n",
      "Multi-sector CDO portfolios: We use a modified version of the Binomial Expansion Technique (BET) model to value our CDS portfolio written on super senior tranches of multi-sector CDOs of ABS. The BET model was developed in 1996 by a major rating agency to generate expected loss estimates for CDO tranches and derive a credit rating for those tranches, and remains widely used.\n",
      "We have adapted the BET model to estimate the price of the super senior risk layer or tranche of the CDO. We modified the BET model to imply default probabilities from market prices for the underlying securities and not from rating agency assumptions. To generate the estimate, the model uses the price estimates for the securities comprising the portfolio of a CDO as an input and converts those estimates to credit spreads over current LIBOR-based interest rates. These credit spreads are used to determine implied probabilities of default and expected losses on the underlying securities. This data is then aggregated and used to estimate the expected cash flows of the super senior tranche of the CDO.\n",
      "Prices for the individual securities held by a CDO are obtained in most cases from the CDO collateral managers, to the extent available. CDO collateral managers provided market prices for 49 percent and 46 percent of the underlying securities used in the valuation at December 31, 2014 and 2013. When a price for an individual security is not provided by a CDO collateral manager, we derive the price through a pricing matrix using prices from CDO collateral managers for similar securities. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used principally to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities, but rather by relying on the relationship of the security to other benchmark quoted securities. Substantially all of the CDO collateral managers who provided prices used dealer prices for all or part of the underlying securities, in some cases supplemented by independent third-party valuation service providers.\n",
      "The BET model also uses diversity scores, weighted average lives, recovery rates and discount rates. We employ a Monte Carlo simulation to assist in quantifying the effect on the valuation of the CDO of the unique aspects of the CDO’s structure such as triggers that divert cash flows to the most senior part of the capital structure. The Monte Carlo simulation is used to determine whether an underlying security defaults in a given simulation scenario and, if it does, the security’s implied random default time and expected loss. This information is used to project cash flow streams and to determine the expected losses of the portfolio.\n",
      "Item 8 / note 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n",
      "In addition to calculating an estimate of the fair value of the super senior CDO security referenced in the CDSs using our internal model, we also consider the price estimates for the super senior CDO securities provided by third parties, including counterparties to these transactions, to validate the results of the model and to determine the best available estimate of fair value. In determining the fair value of the super senior CDO security referenced in the CDSs, we use a consistent process that considers all available pricing data points and eliminates the use of outlying data points. When pricing data points are within a reasonable range an averaging technique is applied.\n",
      "Corporate debt/Collateralized loan obligation (CLO) portfolios: For CDSs written on portfolios of investment-grade corporate debt, we use a mathematical model that produces results that are closely aligned with prices received from third parties. This methodology uses the current market credit spreads of the names in the portfolios along with the base correlations implied by the current market prices of comparable tranches of the relevant market traded credit indices as inputs.\n",
      "We estimate the fair value of our obligations resulting from CDSs written on CLOs to be equivalent to the par value less the current market value of the referenced obligation. Accordingly, the value is determined by obtaining third-party quotations on the underlying super senior tranches referenced under the CDS contract.\n",
      "Long-Term Debt\n",
      "The fair value of non-structured liabilities is generally determined by using market prices from exchange or dealer markets, when available, or discounting expected cash flows using the appropriate discount rate for the applicable maturity. We determine the fair value of structured liabilities and hybrid financial instruments (where performance is linked to structured interest rates, inflation or currency risks) using the appropriate derivative valuation methodology (described above) given the nature of the embedded risk profile. In addition, adjustments are made to the valuations of both non-structured and structured liabilities to reflect our own creditworthiness based on the methodology described under the caption “Incorporation of Credit Risk in Fair Value Measurements - Our Own Credit Risk” above.\n",
      "Borrowings under obligations of guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs), which are guaranteed by us, are recorded at fair value using discounted cash flow calculations based on interest rates currently being offered for similar contracts and our current market observable implicit credit spread rates with maturities consistent with those remaining for the contracts being valued. Obligations may be called at various times prior to maturity at the option of the counterparty. Interest rates on these borrowings are primarily fixed, vary by maturity and range up to 8.5 percent.\n",
      "Other Liabilities\n",
      "Other liabilities measured at fair value include certain securities sold under agreements to repurchase and certain securities sold but not yet purchased. Liabilities arising from securities sold under agreements to repurchase are generally treated as collateralized borrowings. We estimate the fair value of liabilities arising under these agreements by using market-observable interest rates. This methodology considers such factors as the coupon rate, yield curves and other relevant factors. Fair values for securities sold but not yet purchased are based on current market prices.\n",

      "Transfers of Level 1 and Level 2 Assets and Liabilities\n",
      "Our policy is to record transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 at their fair values as of the end of each reporting period, consistent with the date of the determination of fair value. Assets are transferred out of Level 1 when they are no longer transacted with sufficient frequency and volume in an active market. Conversely, assets are transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 when transaction volume and frequency are indicative of an active market. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we transferred $590 million and $944 million, respectively, of securities issued by Non-U.S. government entities from Level 1 to Level 2, because they are no longer considered actively traded. For similar reasons, during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we transferred $107 million and $356 million, respectively, of securities issued by the U.S. government and government-sponsored entities from Level 1 to Level 2. There were no material transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\n",

Transfers of private placement corporate debt and certain ABS into Level 3 assets were primarily the result of limited market pricing information that required us to determine fair value for these securities based on inputs that are adjusted to better reflect our own assumptions regarding the characteristics of a specific security or associated market liquidity. The transfers of investments in RMBS, CMBS and CDO and certain ABS into Level 3 assets were due to decreases in market transparency and liquidity for individual security types. Certain investments in hedge funds were transferred into Level 3 due to these investments now being carried at fair value and no longer being accounted for using the equity method of accounting due to a change in percentage ownership, or as a result of limited market activity due to fund-imposed redemption restrictions.\n",

      "We consider unobservable inputs to be those for which market data is not available and that are developed using the best information available to us about the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Relevant inputs vary depending on the nature of the instrument being measured at fair value. The following is a general description of sensitivities of significant unobservable inputs along with interrelationships between and among the significant unobservable inputs and their impact on the fair value measurements. The effect of a change in a particular assumption in the sensitivity analysis below is considered independently of changes in any other assumptions. In practice, simultaneous changes in assumptions may not always have a linear effect on the inputs discussed below. Interrelationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs. Such relationships have not been included in the discussion below. For each of the individual relationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally apply.\n",
      "Corporate Debt\n",
      "Corporate debt securities included in Level 3 are primarily private placement issuances that are not traded in active markets or that are subject to transfer restrictions. Fair value measurements consider illiquidity and non-transferability. When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow models using discount rates based on credit spreads, yields or price levels of publicly-traded debt of the issuer or other comparable securities, considering illiquidity and structure. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of corporate debt is the yield. The yield is affected by the market movements in credit spreads and U.S. Treasury yields. In addition, the migration in credit quality of a given security generally has a corresponding effect on the fair value measurement of the security. For example, a downward migration of credit quality would increase spreads. Holding U.S. Treasury rates constant, an increase in corporate credit spreads would decrease the fair value of corporate debt.\n",
      "RMBS and Certain CDO/ABS\n",
      "The significant unobservable inputs used in fair value measurements of RMBS and certain CDO/ABS valued by third-party valuation service providers are constant prepayment rates (CPR), loss severity, constant default rates (CDR), and yield. A change in the assumptions used for the probability of default will generally be accompanied by a corresponding change in the assumption used for the loss severity and an inverse change in the assumption used for prepayment rates. In general, increases in CPR, loss severity, CDR, and yield, in isolation, would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement. Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship between the directional change of each input is not usually linear.\n",
      "CMBS\n",
      "The significant unobservable input used in fair value measurements for CMBS is the yield. Prepayment assumptions for each mortgage pool are factored into the yield. CMBS generally feature a lower degree of prepayment risk than RMBS because commercial mortgages generally contain a penalty for prepayment. In general, increases in the yield would decrease the fair value of CMBS.\n",
      "CDO/ABS - Direct Investment book\n",
      "The significant unobservable inputs used for certain CDO/ABS securities valued using the BET are recovery rates, diversity score, and the weighted average life of the portfolio. An increase in recovery rates and diversity score will increase the fair value of the portfolio. An increase in the weighted average life will decrease the fair value.\n",

      "Policyholder contract deposits\n",
      "Embedded derivatives within Policyholder contract deposits relate to guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB) within variable annuity products and certain enhancements to interest crediting rates based on market indices within index annuities and guaranteed investment contracts (GICs). GMWB represents our largest exposure of these embedded derivatives, although the carrying amount of the liability fluctuates based on the performance of the equity markets and therefore, at a point in time, can be low relative to the exposure. The principal unobservable input used for GMWBs and embedded derivatives in index annuities measured at fair value is equity implied volatility. For GMWBs, other significant unobservable inputs include base and dynamic lapse rates, mortality rates, and utilization rates. Lapse, mortality, and utilization rates may vary significantly depending upon age groups and duration. In general, increases in volatility and utilization rates will increase the fair value of the liability associated with GMWB, while increases in lapse rates and mortality rates will decrease the fair value of the liability. Significant unobservable inputs used in valuing embedded derivatives within GICs include long-term forward interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Generally, the embedded derivative liability for GICs will increase as interest rates decrease or if the U.S. dollar weakens compared to the euro.\n",
      "Derivative liabilities - credit contracts\n",
      "The significant unobservable inputs used for Derivatives liabilities - credit contracts are recovery rates, diversity scores, and the weighted average life of the portfolio. AIG non-performance risk is also considered in the measurement of the liability.\n",
      "An increase in recovery rates and diversity score will decrease the fair value of the liability. An increase in the weighted average life will increase the fair value measurement of the liability.\n",

At December 31, 2014, assuming average original expected lives of 10 years for the funds, 72 percent of the total fair value using net asset value per share (or its equivalent) presented above would have expected remaining lives of three years or less, 18 percent between four and six years and 10 percent between seven and 10 years.\n",

At December 31, 2014, however, investments representing approximately 43 percent of the total fair value of the hedge fund investments cannot be redeemed, either in whole or in part, because the investments include various contractual restrictions. The majority of these contractual restrictions, which may have been put in place at the fund’s inception or thereafter, have pre-defined end dates and are generally expected to be lifted by the end of 2015. The fund investments for which redemption is restricted only in part generally relate to certain hedge funds that hold at least one investment that the fund manager deems to be illiquid.\n",

      "FAIR VALUE INFORMATION ABOUT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE\n",
      "Information regarding the estimation of fair value for financial instruments not carried at fair value (excluding insurance contracts and lease contracts) is discussed below:\n",
      "• Mortgage and other loans receivable: Fair values of loans on real estate and other loans receivable are estimated for disclosure purposes using discounted cash flow calculations based on discount rates that we believe market participants would use in determining the price that they would pay for such assets. For certain loans, our current incremental lending rates for similar types of loans are used as the discount rates, because we believe this rate approximates the rates market participants would use. The fair values of policy loans are generally estimated based on unpaid principal amount as of each reporting date or, in some cases, based on the present value of the loans using a discounted cash flow model. No consideration is given to credit risk because policy loans are effectively collateralized by the cash surrender value of the policies.\n",
      "• Other invested assets: The majority of Other invested assets that are not measured at fair value represent investments in life settlements. The fair value of investments in life settlements is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology that incorporates the best available market assumptions for longevity as well as market yields based on reported transactions. Due to the individual life nature of each investment in life settlements and the illiquidity of the existing market, significant inputs to the fair value are unobservable.\n",
      "• Cash and short-term investments: The carrying amounts of these assets approximate fair values because of the relatively short period of time between origination and expected realization, and their limited exposure to credit risk.\n",
      "• Policyholder contract deposits associated with investment-type contracts: Fair values for policyholder contract deposits associated with investment-type contracts not accounted for at fair value are estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based on interest rates currently being offered for similar contracts with maturities consistent with those of the contracts being valued. When no similar contracts are being offered, the discount rate is the appropriate swap rate (if available) or current risk-free interest rate consistent with the currency in which the cash flows are denominated. To determine fair value, other factors include current policyholder account values and related surrender charges and other assumptions include expectations about policyholder behavior and an appropriate risk margin.\n",
      "• Other liabilities: The majority of Other liabilities that are financial instruments not measured at fair value represent secured financing arrangements, including repurchase agreements. The carrying amounts of these liabilities approximate fair value, because the financing arrangements are short-term and are secured by cash or other liquid collateral.\n",
      "• Long-term debt: Fair values of these obligations were determined by reference to quoted market prices, when available and appropriate, or discounted cash flow calculations based upon our current market-observable implicit-credit-spread rates for similar types of borrowings with maturities consistent with those remaining for the debt being valued.\n",

      "Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities\n",
      "Bonds held to maturity are carried at amortized cost when we have the ability and positive intent to hold these securities until maturity. When we do not have the ability or positive intent to hold bonds until maturity, these securities are classified as available for sale or are measured at fair value at our election. None of our fixed maturity securities met the criteria for held to maturity classification at December 31, 2014 or 2013.\n",
      "Fixed maturity and equity securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses from available for sale investments in fixed maturity and equity securities are reported as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred income taxes, in shareholders’ equity. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from fixed maturity and equity securities measured at fair value at our election are reflected in Net investment income (for insurance subsidiaries) or Other income (for Corporate and Other). Investments in fixed maturity and equity securities are recorded on a trade-date basis.\n",
      "Premiums and discounts arising from the purchase of bonds classified as available for sale are treated as yield adjustments over their estimated holding periods, until maturity, or call date, if applicable. For investments in certain RMBS, CMBS and CDO/ABS, (collectively, structured securities), recognized yields are updated based on current information regarding the timing and amount of expected undiscounted future cash flows. For high credit quality structured securities, effective yields are recalculated based on actual payments received and updated prepayment expectations, and the amortized cost is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since acquisition with a corresponding charge or credit to net investment income. For structured securities that are not high credit quality, effective yields are recalculated and adjusted prospectively based on changes in expected undiscounted future cash flows. For purchased credit impaired (PCI) securities, at acquisition, the difference between the undiscounted expected future cash flows and the recorded investment in the securities represents the initial accretable yield, which is to be accreted into net investment income over the securities’ remaining lives on a level-yield basis. Subsequently, effective yields recognized on PCI securities are recalculated and adjusted prospectively to reflect changes in the contractual benchmark interest rates on variable rate securities and any significant increases in undiscounted expected future cash flows arising due to reasons other than interest rate changes.\n",

      "If we intend to sell a fixed maturity security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and the fair value of the security is below amortized cost, an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred and the amortized cost is written down to current fair value, with a corresponding charge to realized capital losses. When assessing our intent to sell a fixed maturity security, or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, management evaluates relevant facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, decisions to reposition our investment portfolio, sales of securities to meet cash flow needs and sales of securities to take advantage of favorable pricing.\n",
      "For fixed maturity securities for which a credit impairment has occurred, the amortized cost is written down to the estimated recoverable value with a corresponding charge to realized capital losses. The estimated recoverable value is the present value of cash flows expected to be collected, as determined by management. The difference between fair value and amortized cost that is not related to a credit impairment is presented in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of fixed maturity securities on which other-than-temporary credit impairments were recognized (a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income).\n",
      "When estimating future cash flows for structured fixed maturity securities (e.g., RMBS, CMBS, CDO, ABS) management considers historical performance of underlying assets and available market information as well as bond-specific structural considerations, such as credit enhancement and priority of payment structure of the security. In addition, the process of estimating future cash flows includes, but is not limited to, the following critical inputs, which vary by asset class:\n",
      "• Current delinquency rates;\n",
      "• Expected default rates and the timing of such defaults;\n",
      "• Loss severity and the timing of any recovery; and\n",
      "• Expected prepayment speeds.\n",
      "For corporate, municipal and sovereign fixed maturity securities determined to be credit impaired, management considers the fair value as the recoverable value when available information does not indicate that another value is more relevant or reliable. When management identifies information that supports a recoverable value other than the fair value, the determination of a recoverable value considers scenarios specific to the issuer and the security, and may be based upon estimates of outcomes of corporate restructurings, political and macroeconomic factors, stability and financial strength of the issuer, the value of any secondary sources of repayment and the disposition of assets.\n",
      "We consider severe price declines in our assessment of potential credit impairments. We may also modify our model inputs when we determine that price movements in certain sectors are indicative of factors not captured by the cash flow models.\n",
      "Item 8 / note 6. INVESTMENTS\n",
      "In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign exchange related, we prospectively accrete into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recoverable value over the remaining expected holding period of the security.\n",

      "Equity Securities\n",
      "We evaluate our available for sale equity securities for impairment by considering such securities as candidates for other-than-temporary impairment if they meet any of the following criteria:\n",
      "• The security has traded at a significant (25 percent or more) discount to cost for an extended period of time (nine consecutive months or longer);\n",
      "• A discrete credit event has occurred resulting in (i) the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation; (ii) the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for court-supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprises; or (iii) the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than the par value of their claims; or\n",
      "• We have concluded that we may not realize a full recovery on our investment, regardless of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events.\n",
      "The determination that an equity security is other-than-temporarily impaired requires the judgment of management and consideration of the fundamental condition of the issuer, its near-term prospects and all the relevant facts and circumstances. In addition to the above criteria, all equity securities that have been in a continuous decline in value below cost over twelve months are impaired. We also consider circumstances of a rapid and severe market valuation decline (50 percent or more) discount to cost, in which we could not reasonably assert that the impairment period would be temporary (severity losses).\n",
      "Other Invested Assets\n",
      "Our equity and cost method investments in private equity funds, hedge funds and other entities are evaluated for impairment similar to the evaluation of equity securities for impairments as discussed above. Such evaluation considers market conditions, events and volatility that may impact the recoverability of the underlying investments within these private equity funds and hedge funds and is based on the nature of the underlying investments and specific inherent risks. Such risks may evolve based on the nature of the underlying investments.\n",
      "Item 8 / note 6. INVESTMENTS\n",
      "Our investments in life settlements are monitored for impairment on a contract-by-contract basis quarterly. An investment in life settlements is considered impaired if the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the expected proceeds from the investment in life settlements would not be sufficient to recover our estimated future carrying amount of the investment in life settlements, which is the current carrying amount for the investment in life settlements plus anticipated undiscounted future premiums and other capitalizable future costs, if any. Impaired investments in life settlements are written down to their estimated fair value which is determined on a discounted cash flow basis, incorporating current market longevity assumptions and market yields.\n",
      "In general, fair value estimates for the investments in life settlements are calculated using cash flows based on medical underwriting ratings of the policies from a third-party underwriter, applied to an industry mortality table. Our mortality assumptions are based on an industry table as supplemented with proprietary data on the older age mortality of U.S. insured lives. Mortality improvement factors are applied to these assumptions based on our view of future mortality improvements likely to apply to the U.S. insured lives population. Our mortality assumptions coupled with the mortality improvement rates are used in our estimate of future net cash flows from the investments in life settlements.\n",
      "Our investments in aircraft assets and real estate are periodically evaluated for recoverability whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may be impaired. When impairment indicators are present, we compare expected investment cash flows to carrying amount. When the expected cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the investments are written down to fair value with a corresponding charge to earnings.\n",

We determine, based on our expectations as to the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be received, whether it is probable at acquisition that we will not collect all contractually required payments for these PCI securities, including both principal and interest after considering the effects of prepayments. At acquisition, the timing and amount of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be received on each PCI security is determined based on our best estimate using key assumptions, such as interest rates, default rates and prepayment speeds. At acquisition, the difference between the undiscounted expected future cash flows of the PCI securities and the recorded investment in the securities represents the initial accretable yield, which is accreted into Net investment income over their remaining lives on a level-yield basis. Additionally, the difference between the contractually required payments on the PCI securities and the undiscounted expected future cash flows represents the non-accretable difference at acquisition. The accretable yield and the non-accretable difference will change over time, based on actual payments received and changes in estimates of undiscounted expected future cash flows, which are discussed further below.\n",
      "On a quarterly basis, the undiscounted expected future cash flows associated with PCI securities are re-evaluated based on updates to key assumptions. Declines in undiscounted expected future cash flows due to further credit deterioration as well as changes in the expected timing of the cash flows can result in the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge, as PCI securities are subject to our policy for evaluating investments for other-than-temporary impairment. Changes to undiscounted expected future cash flows due solely to the changes in the contractual benchmark interest rates on variable rate PCI securities will change the accretable yield prospectively. Significant increases in undiscounted expected future cash flows for reasons other than interest rate changes are recognized prospectively as adjustments to the accretable yield.\n",

The fair value of securities pledged as collateral with respect to these obligations approximated $3.5 billion and $4.2 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This collateral primarily consists of securities of the U.S. government and government sponsored entities and generally cannot be repledged or resold by the counterparties.\n",
      "7. LENDING ACTIVITIES\n",
      "Mortgage and other loans receivable include commercial mortgages, life insurance policy loans, commercial loans, and other loans and notes receivable. Commercial mortgages, commercial loans, and other loans and notes receivable are carried at unpaid principal balances less credit allowances and plus or minus adjustments for the accretion or amortization of discount or premium. Interest income on such loans is accrued as earned.\n",
      "Direct costs of originating commercial mortgages, commercial loans, and other loans and notes receivable, net of nonrefundable points and fees, are deferred and included in the carrying amount of the related receivables. The amount deferred is amortized to income as an adjustment to earnings using the interest method.\n",
      "Life insurance policy loans are carried at unpaid principal amount. There is no allowance for policy loans because these loans serve to reduce the death benefit paid when the death claim is made and the balances are effectively collateralized by the cash surrender value of the policy.\n",
      "The following table presents the composition of Mortgages and other loans receivable:\n",
      "* Commercial mortgages primarily represent loans for apartments, offices, retail and industrial properties, with exposures in California and New York representing the largest geographic concentrations (14 percent and 18 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2014 and 18 percent and 17 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2013).\n",

      "(b) Does not reflect allowance for losses.\n",
      "(c) Over 99 percent of the commercial mortgages held at such respective dates were current as to payments of principal and interest.\n",
      "Methodology Used to Estimate the Allowance for Losses\n",
      "Mortgage and other loans receivable are considered impaired when collection of all amounts due under contractual terms is not probable. Impairment is measured using either i) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, ii) the loan’s observable market price, if available, or iii) the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Impairment of commercial mortgages is typically determined using the fair value of collateral while impairment of other loans is typically determined using the present value of cash flows or the loan’s observable market price. An allowance is typically established for the difference between the impaired value of the loan and its current carrying amount. Additional allowance amounts are established for incurred but not specifically identified impairments, based on the analysis of internal risk ratings and current loan values. Internal risk ratings are assigned based on the consideration of risk factors including past due status, debt service coverage, loan-to-value ratio, property occupancy, profile of the borrower and of the major property tenants, economic trends in the market where the property is located, and condition of the property. These factors and the resulting risk ratings also provide a basis for determining the level of monitoring performed at both the individual loan and the portfolio level. When all or a portion of a loan is deemed uncollectible, the uncollectible portion of the carrying amount of the loan is charged off against the allowance. Interest income on impaired loans is recognized as cash is received. For impaired loans where it has been determined that not all of the contractual principal due will be collected, any cash received is recorded as a reduction of the current carrying amount of the loan.\n",
      "A significant majority of commercial mortgage loans in the portfolio are non-recourse loans and, accordingly, the only guarantees are for specific items that are exceptions to the non-recourse provisions. It is therefore extremely rare for us to have cause to enforce the provisions of a guarantee on a commercial real estate or mortgage loan.\n",
      "The following table presents a rollforward of the changes in the allowance for losses on Mortgage and other loans receivable:\n",
      "Item 8 / note 7. LENDING ACTIVITIES\n",
      "* Of the total allowance at the end of the year, $55 million and $93 million relates to individually assessed credit losses on $192 million and $264 million of commercial mortgage loans as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n",
      "Troubled Debt Restructurings\n",
      "We modify loans to optimize their returns and improve their collectability, among other things. When we undertake such a modification with a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty and the modification involves us granting a concession to the troubled debtor, the modification is a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). We assess whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty based on a variety of factors, including the borrower’s current default on any of its outstanding debt, the probability of a default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification, the insufficiency of the borrower’s forecasted cash flows to service any of its outstanding debt (including both principal and interest), and the borrower’s inability to access alternative third-party financing at an interest rate that would be reflective of current market conditions for a non-troubled debtor. Concessions granted may include extended maturity dates, interest rate changes, principal or interest forgiveness, payment deferrals and easing of loan covenants.\n",
      "During 2014 and 2013, loans with a carrying value of $218 million and $91 million were modified in TDRs, respectively.\n",
      "8. REINSURANCE\n",
      "In the ordinary course of business, our insurance companies may use both treaty and facultative reinsurance to minimize their net loss exposure to any single catastrophic loss event or to an accumulation of losses from a number of smaller events or to provide greater diversification of our businesses. In addition, our general insurance subsidiaries assume reinsurance from other insurance companies. We determine the portion of the incurred but not reported (IBNR) loss that will be recoverable under our reinsurance contracts by reference to the terms of the reinsurance protection purchased. This determination is necessarily based on the estimate of IBNR and accordingly, is subject to the same uncertainties as the estimate of IBNR. Reinsurance assets include the balances due from reinsurance and insurance companies under the terms of our reinsurance agreements for paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, ceded unearned premiums and ceded future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and benefits paid and unpaid. Amounts related to paid and unpaid losses and benefits and loss expenses with respect to these reinsurance agreements are substantially collateralized. We remain liable to the extent that our reinsurers do not meet their obligation under the reinsurance contracts, and as such, we regularly evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor concentration of our credit risk. The estimation of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires judgment for which key inputs typically include historical trends regarding uncollectible balances, disputes and credit events as well as specific reviews of balances in dispute or subject to credit impairment. The allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance assets was $258 million and $276 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance assets are reflected in Policyholder benefits and losses incurred within the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n",
      "The following table provides supplemental information for loss and benefit reserves, gross and net of ceded reinsurance:\n",

      "(a) In 2014 and 2013, the Net of Reinsurance amount reflects the cession under the June 17, 2011 transaction with National Indemnity Company (NICO) of $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively.\n",
      "(b) Represents gross reinsurance assets, excluding allowances and reinsurance recoverable on paid losses.\n",
      "Short-Duration Reinsurance\n",
      "Short-duration reinsurance is affected under reinsurance treaties and by negotiation on individual risks. Certain of these reinsurance arrangements consist of excess of loss contracts that protect us against losses above stipulated amounts. Ceded premiums are considered prepaid reinsurance premiums and are recognized as a reduction of premiums earned over the contract period in proportion to the protection received. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers on short-duration contracts are estimated in a manner consistent with the claims liabilities associated with the reinsurance and presented as a component of Reinsurance assets. Assumed reinsurance premiums are earned primarily on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the reinsurance contracts and the portion of premiums relating to the unexpired terms of coverage is included in the reserve for unearned premiums. For both ceded and assumed reinsurance, risk transfer requirements must be met for reinsurance accounting to apply. If risk transfer requirements are not met, the contract is accounted for as a deposit, resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract through a deposit asset or liability and not as revenue or expense. To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk, consisting of both underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity. Similar risk transfer criteria are used to determine whether directly written insurance contracts should be accounted for as insurance or as a deposit.\n",
      "The following table presents short-duration insurance premiums written and earned:\n",
      "For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, reinsurance recoveries, which reduced losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, amounted to $2.6 billion, $3.3 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively.\n",
      "Long-Duration Reinsurance\n",
      "Long-duration reinsurance is effected principally under yearly renewable term treaties. The premiums with respect to these treaties are earned over the contract period in proportion to the protection provided. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers on long-duration contracts are estimated in a manner consistent with the assumptions used for the underlying policy benefits and are presented as a component of Reinsurance assets.\n",
      "The following table presents premiums for our long-duration insurance and retirement services operations:\n",
      "Item 8 / note 8. REINSURANCE\n",
      "Long-duration reinsurance recoveries, which reduced Policyholder benefits and losses incurred, were approximately $731 million, $714 million and $758 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.\n",
      "The following table presents long-duration insurance in-force ceded to other insurance companies:\n",
      "* Excludes amounts related to held-for-sale entities.\n",
      "Long-duration insurance in force assumed represented 0.04 percent of gross long-duration insurance in force at December 31, 2014, 0.05 percent at December 31, 2013 and 0.05 percent at December 31, 2012, and premiums assumed by the Life Insurance Companies represented 0.5 percent, 0.3 percent and 0.4 percent of gross premiums for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\n",
      "The domestic Life Insurance Companies utilize internal and third-party reinsurance relationships to manage insurance risks and to facilitate capital management strategies, which allows them to minimize the use of letters of credit and utilize capital more efficiently. Pools of highly-rated third-party reinsurers are utilized to manage net amounts at risk in excess of retention limits.\n",
      "The domestic Life Insurance Companies manage the capital impact on their statutory reserve requirements under the NAIC Model Regulation “Valuation of Life Insurance Policies” (Regulation XXX) and NAIC Actuarial Guideline 38 (Guideline AXXX) through intercompany reinsurance transactions. Under GAAP, these intercompany reinsurance transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Under one arrangement, one of the domestic Life Insurance Companies obtains letters of credit to support statutory recognition of the ceded reinsurance. As of December 31, 2014, the domestic Life Insurance Companies had two bilateral letters of credit totaling $450 million with AIG entities, which were issued on February 7, 2014 and expire on February 7, 2019, but will be automatically extended without amendment by one year on each anniversary of the issuance date, unless the issuer provides notice of non-renewal. See Note 20 for additional information on the use of affiliated reinsurance for Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX reserves.\n",
      "Reinsurance Security\n",
      "Our third-party reinsurance arrangements do not relieve us from our direct obligations to our beneficiaries. Thus, a credit exposure exists with respect to both short-duration and long-duration reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer fails to meet the obligations assumed under any reinsurance agreement. We hold substantial collateral as security under related reinsurance agreements in the form of funds, securities, and/or letters of credit. A provision has been recorded for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance. We believe that no exposure to a single reinsurer represents an inappropriate concentration of credit risk to AIG. Gross reinsurance assets with our three largest reinsurers aggregate to approximately $6.2 billion and $6.0 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, of which approximately $3.3 billion was not secured by collateral in both years.\n",
      "9. DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS\n",
      "Deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) represent those costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal of existing insurance contracts. We defer incremental costs that result directly from, and are essential to, the acquisition or renewal of an insurance contract. Such deferred policy acquisition costs generally include agent or broker commissions and bonuses, premium taxes, and medical and inspection fees that would not have been incurred if the insurance contract had not been acquired or renewed. Each cost is analyzed to assess whether it is fully deferrable. We partially defer costs, including certain commissions, when we do not believe that the entire cost is directly related to the acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts.\n",
      "We also defer a portion of employee total compensation and payroll-related fringe benefits directly related to time spent performing specific acquisition or renewal activities, including costs associated with the time spent on underwriting, policy\n",
      "Item 8 / note 8. REINSURANCE\n",
      "issuance and processing, and sales force contract selling. The amounts deferred are derived based on successful efforts for each distribution channel and/or cost center from which the cost originates.\n",
      "Short-duration insurance contracts: Policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums written are earned, generally 12 months. DAC is grouped consistent with the manner in which the insurance contracts are acquired, serviced and measured for profitability and is reviewed for recoverability based on the profitability of the underlying insurance contracts. Investment income is anticipated in assessing the recoverability of DAC. We assess the recoverability of DAC on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. This assessment is performed by comparing recorded net unearned premiums and anticipated investment income on in-force business to the sum of expected losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, unamortized DAC and maintenance costs. If the sum of these costs exceeds the amount of recorded net unearned premiums and anticipated investment income, the excess is recognized as an offset against the asset established for DAC. This offset is referred to as a premium deficiency charge. Increases in expected losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred can have a significant impact on the likelihood and amount of a premium deficiency charge.\n",
      "Long-duration insurance contracts: Policy acquisition costs for participating life, traditional life and accident and health insurance products are generally deferred and amortized, with interest, over the premium paying period. The assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and DAC for these traditional products are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. These “locked-in” assumptions include mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses and investment returns, and include margins for adverse deviation to reflect uncertainty given that actual experience might deviate from these assumptions. A loss recognition event occurs when there is a shortfall between the carrying amounts of future policy benefit liabilities net of DAC and the amount the future policy benefit liabilities net of DAC would be when applying updated current assumptions. When we determine a loss recognition event has occurred, we first reduce any DAC related to that block of business through amortization of acquisition expense, and after DAC is depleted, we record additional liabilities through a charge to Policyholder benefits and losses incurred. Groupings for loss recognition testing are consistent with our manner of acquiring and servicing the business and applied by product groupings. We perform separate loss recognition tests for traditional life products, payout annuities and long-term care products. Once loss recognition has been recorded for a block of business, the old assumption set is replaced and the assumption set used for the loss recognition would then be subject to the lock-in principle.\n",
      "Investment-oriented contracts: Policy acquisition costs and policy issuance costs related to universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) are deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts. Estimated gross profits include net investment income and spreads, net realized investment gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses, and mortality gains and losses. In each reporting period, current period amortization expense is adjusted to reflect actual gross profits. If estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC is recalculated using the new assumptions, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. If the new assumptions indicate that future estimated gross profits are higher than previously estimated, DAC will be increased resulting in a decrease in amortization expense and increase in income in the current period; if future estimated gross profits are lower than previously estimated, DAC will be decreased resulting in an increase in amortization expense and decrease in income in the current period. Updating such assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products. DAC is grouped consistent with the manner in which the insurance contracts are acquired, serviced and measured for profitability and is reviewed for recoverability based on the current and projected future profitability of the underlying insurance contracts.\n",
      "To estimate future estimated gross profits for variable annuity products, a long-term annual asset growth assumption is applied to determine the future growth in assets and related asset-based fees. In determining the asset growth rate, the effect of short-term fluctuations in the equity markets is partially mitigated through the use of a “reversion to the mean” methodology whereby short-term asset growth above or below long-term annual rate assumptions impact the growth assumption applied to the five-year period subsequent to the current balance sheet date. The reversion to the mean methodology allows us to maintain our long-term growth assumptions, while also giving consideration to the effect of actual investment performance. When actual performance significantly deviates from the annual long-term growth assumption, as evidenced by growth assumptions in the five-year reversion to the mean period falling below a certain rate (floor) or above a certain rate (cap) for a sustained period, judgment may be applied to revise or “unlock” the growth rate assumptions to be used for both the five-year reversion to the mean period as well as the long-term annual growth assumption applied to subsequent periods.\n",
      "Item 8 / note 9. DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS\n",
      "Shadow DAC and Shadow Loss Recognition: DAC related to investment-oriented products is also adjusted to reflect the effect of unrealized gains or losses on fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale on estimated gross profits, with related changes recognized through Other comprehensive income (shadow DAC). The adjustment is made at each balance sheet date, as if the securities had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields. Similarly, for long-duration traditional insurance contracts, if the assets supporting the liabilities maintain a temporary net unrealized gain position at the balance sheet date, loss recognition testing assumptions are updated to exclude such gains from future cash flows by reflecting the impact of reinvestment rates on future yields. If a future loss is anticipated under this basis, any additional shortfall indicated by loss recognition tests is recognized as a reduction in accumulated other comprehensive income (shadow loss recognition). Similar to other loss recognition on long-duration insurance contracts, such shortfall is first reflected as a reduction in DAC and secondly as an increase in liabilities for future policy benefits. The change in these adjustments, net of tax, is included with the change in net unrealized appreciation of investments that is credited or charged directly to Other comprehensive income.\n",
      "Internal Replacements of Long-duration and Investment-oriented Products: For some products, policyholders can elect to modify product benefits, features, rights or coverages by exchanging a contract for a new contract or by amendment, endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract. These transactions are known as internal replacements. If the modification does not substantially change the contract, we do not change the accounting and amortization of existing DAC and related actuarial balances. If an internal replacement represents a substantial change, the original contract is considered to be extinguished and any related DAC or other policy balances are charged or credited to income, and any new deferrable costs associated with the replacement contract are deferred.\n",
      "Value of Business Acquired (VOBA) is determined at the time of acquisition and is reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets with DAC. This value is based on the present value of future pre-tax profits discounted at yields applicable at the time of purchase. For participating life, traditional life and accident and health insurance products, VOBA is amortized over the life of the business in a manner similar to that for DAC based on the assumptions at purchase. For investment-oriented products, VOBA is amortized in relation to estimated gross profits and adjusted for the effect of unrealized gains or losses on fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale in a manner similar to DAC.\n",
      "The following table presents a rollforward of DAC and VOBA:\n",

      "The percentage of the unamortized balance of VOBA at December 31, 2014 expected to be amortized in 2015 through 2019 by year is: 10.1 percent, 8.9 percent, 7.9 percent, 7.2 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively, with 59.2 percent being amortized\n",

      "A variable interest entity (VIE) is a legal entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or is structured such that equity investors lack the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights or do not substantively participate in the gains and losses of the entity. Consolidation of a VIE by its primary beneficiary is not based on majority voting interest, but is based on other criteria discussed below.\n",
      "We enter into various arrangements with VIEs in the normal course of business and consolidate the VIEs when we determine we are the primary beneficiary. This analysis includes a review of the VIE’s capital structure, related contractual relationships and terms, nature of the VIE’s operations and purpose, nature of the VIE’s interests issued and our involvement with the entity. When assessing the need to consolidate a VIE, we evaluate the design of the VIE as well as the related risks the entity was designed to expose the variable interest holders to.\n",
      "For VIEs with attributes consistent with that of an investment company or a money market fund, the primary beneficiary is the party or group of related parties that absorbs a majority of the expected losses of the VIE, receives the majority of the expected residual returns of the VIE, or both.\n",
      "For all other VIEs, the primary beneficiary is the entity that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the entity’s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. While also considering these factors, the consolidation conclusion depends on the breadth of our decision-making ability and our ability to influence activities that significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE.\n",

Interest rate, currency, equity and commodity swaps, credit contracts (including the super senior credit default swap portfolio), swaptions, options and forward transactions are accounted for as derivatives, recorded on a trade-date basis and carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in income, when appropriate. In certain instances, a contract’s transaction price is the best indication of initial fair value. Aggregate asset or liability positions are netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheets only to the extent permitted by qualifying master netting arrangements in place with each respective counterparty. Cash collateral posted with counterparties in conjunction with transactions supported by qualifying master netting arrangements is reported as a reduction of the corresponding net derivative liability, while cash collateral received in conjunction with transactions supported by qualifying master netting arrangements is reported as a reduction of the corresponding net derivative asset.\n",

      "Collateral\n",
      "We engage in derivative transactions that are not subject to a clearing requirement directly with unaffiliated third parties, in most cases, under International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) agreements. Many of the ISDA agreements also include Credit Support Annex (CSA) provisions, which provide for collateral postings that may vary at various ratings and threshold levels. We attempt to reduce our risk with certain counterparties by entering into agreements that enable collateral to be obtained from a counterparty on an upfront or contingent basis. We minimize the risk that counterparties to transactions might be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and collateral value and may require additional collateral to be posted upon the occurrence of certain events or circumstances. In addition, certain derivative transactions have provisions that require collateral to be posted upon a downgrade of our long-term debt ratings or give the counterparty the right to terminate the transaction. In the case of some of the derivative transactions, upon a downgrade of our long-term debt ratings, as an alternative to posting collateral and subject to certain conditions, we may assign the transaction to an obligor with higher debt ratings or arrange for a substitute guarantee of our obligations by an obligor with higher debt ratings or take other similar action. The actual amount of collateral required to be posted to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at and after the time of the downgrade.\n",
      "Collateral posted by us to third parties for derivative transactions was $3.3 billion and $3.2 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In the case of collateral posted under derivative transactions that are not subject to clearing, this collateral can generally be repledged or resold by the counterparties. Collateral provided to us from third parties for derivative transactions was $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We generally can repledge or resell collateral posted under derivative transactions that are not subject to clearing.\n",

      "Hedge Accounting\n",
      "We designated certain derivatives entered into by GCM with third parties as fair value hedges of available-for-sale investment securities held by our insurance subsidiaries. The fair value hedges include foreign currency forwards designated as hedges of the change in fair value of foreign currency denominated available-for-sale securities attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. We previously designated certain interest rate swaps entered into by GCM with third parties as cash flow hedges of certain floating rate debt issued by ILFC, specifically to hedge the changes in cash flows on floating rate debt attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. We de-designated such derivatives as cash flow hedges in December 2012 in connection with ILFC being classified as held-for-sale.\n",
      "We use foreign currency denominated debt and cross-currency swaps as hedging instruments in net investment hedge relationships to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with our non-U.S. dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. We assess the hedge effectiveness and measure the amount of ineffectiveness for these hedge relationships based on changes in spot exchange rates. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 we recognized gain of $156 million, and losses of $38 million and $74 million, respectively, included in Change in foreign currency translation adjustments in Other comprehensive income related to the net investment hedge relationships.\n",

Gains or losses recognized in earnings on derivatives for the ineffective portion were previously recorded in Net realized capital gains (losses).\n",

      "Global Capital Markets Derivatives\n",
      "Derivative transactions between AIG and its subsidiaries and third parties are generally centralized through GCM, specifically AIG Markets. The derivatives portfolio of AIG Markets consists primarily of interest rate and currency derivatives and also\n",
      "Item 8 / note 11. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING\n",
      "includes legacy credit derivatives that have been novated from AIGFP. AIGFP also enters into derivatives to mitigate market risk in its exposures (interest rates, currencies, credit, commodities and equities) arising from its portfolio of remaining transactions.\n",
      "GCM follows a policy of minimizing interest rate, currency, commodity, and equity risks associated with investment securities by entering into offsetting positions, thereby offsetting a significant portion of the unrealized appreciation and depreciation.\n",
      "Super Senior Credit Default Swaps\n",
      "Credit default swap transactions were entered into by AIGFP with the intention of earning revenue on credit exposure. In the majority of these transactions, we sold credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities. Generally, such credit protection was provided on a “second loss” basis, meaning we would incur credit losses only after a shortfall of principal and/or interest, or other credit events, in respect of the protected loans and debt securities, exceeded a specified threshold amount or level of “first losses.”\n",
      "The following table presents the net notional amount (net of all structural subordination below the covered tranches), fair value of derivative liability before the effects of counterparty netting adjustments and offsetting cash collateral and unrealized market valuation gain of the super senior credit default swap portfolio by asset class:\n",
      "(a) During 2014, we paid $67 million to counterparties with respect to multi-sector CDOs, which was previously included in the fair value of the derivative liability as an unrealized market valuation loss. Collateral postings with regards to multi-sector CDOs were $852 million and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n",
      "(b) Corporate debt/Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) include $555 million and $1.0 billion in net notional amount of credit default swaps written on the super senior tranches of CLOs at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Collateral postings with regards to corporate debt/CLOs were $147 million and $353 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n",
      "(c) On July 17, 2014, AIGFP terminated Corporate Debt Super Senior CDSs with a notional amount of $8.8 billion.\n",
      "The expected weighted average maturity of the super senior credit derivative portfolios as of December 31, 2014 was five years for the multi-sector CDO arbitrage portfolio and three years for the corporate debt/CLO portfolio.\n",
      "Because of long-term maturities of the CDSs in the arbitrage portfolio, we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the periods during which any payments would be made. However, the net notional amount represents the maximum exposure to loss on the super senior credit default swap portfolio.\n",
      "Written Single Name Credit Default Swaps\n",
      "We have legacy credit default swap contracts referencing single-name exposures written on corporate, index and asset-backed credits with the intention of earning spread income on credit exposure. Some of these transactions were entered into as part of a long-short strategy to earn the net spread between CDSs written and purchased. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the net notional amounts of these written CDS contracts were $190 million and $373 million, respectively, including ABS CDS transactions purchased from a liquidated multi-sector super senior CDS transaction. These exposures were partially hedged by purchasing offsetting CDS contracts of $5 million and $50 million in net notional amounts at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The net unhedged positions of $185 million and $323 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, represent the maximum exposure to loss on these CDS contracts. The average maturity of the written CDS contracts was two years and three years at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the fair values of derivative liabilities (which represents the carrying amount) of the portfolio of CDS was $25 million and $32 million, respectively.\n",
      "Item 8 / note 11. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING\n",
      "Upon a triggering event (e.g., a default) with respect to the underlying reference obligations, settlement is generally effected through the payment of the notional amount of the contract to the counterparty in exchange for the related principal amount of securities issued by the underlying credit obligor (physical settlement) or, in some cases, payment of an amount associated with the value of the notional amount of the reference obligations through a market quotation process (cash settlement).\n",
      "These CDS contracts were written under ISDA Master Agreements. The majority of these ISDA Master Agreements include credit support annexes (CSAs) that provide for collateral postings that may vary at various ratings and threshold levels. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, net collateral posted by us under these contracts was $30 million and $38 million, respectively, prior to offsets for other transactions.\n",
      "All Other Derivatives\n",
      "Our businesses, other than GCM, also use derivatives and other instruments as part of their financial risk management. Interest rate derivatives (such as interest rate swaps) are used to manage interest rate risk associated with embedded derivatives contained in insurance contract liabilities, fixed maturity securities, outstanding medium- and long-term notes as well as other interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. Foreign exchange derivatives (principally foreign exchange forwards and options) are used to economically mitigate risk associated with non-U.S. dollar denominated debt, net capital exposures, and foreign currency transactions. Equity derivatives are used to mitigate financial risk embedded in certain insurance liabilities. The derivatives are effective economic hedges of the exposures that they are meant to offset.\n",
      "In addition to hedging activities, we also enter into derivative instruments with respect to investment operations, which include, among other things, credit default swaps and purchasing investments with embedded derivatives, such as equity-linked notes and convertible bonds.\n",
      "Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features\n",
      "The aggregate fair value of our derivative instruments that contain credit risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position at December 31, 2014 and 2013, was approximately $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. The aggregate fair value of assets posted as collateral under these contracts at December 31, 2014 and 2013, was $2.7 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively.\n",
      "We estimate that at December 31, 2014, based on our outstanding financial derivative transactions, a one-notch downgrade of our long-term senior debt ratings to BBB+ by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (S&P), would permit counterparties to make additional collateral calls and permit certain counterparties to elect early termination of contracts, resulting in a negligible amount of corresponding collateral postings and termination payments; a one-notch downgrade to Baa2 by Moody’s Investors’ Service, Inc. (Moody’s) and an additional one-notch downgrade to BBB by S&P would result in approximately $46 million in additional collateral postings and termination payments, and a further one-notch downgrade to Baa3 by Moody’s and BBB- by S&P would result in approximately $153 million in additional collateral postings and termination payments.\n",
      "Additional collateral postings upon downgrade are estimated based on the factors in the individual collateral posting provisions of the CSA with each counterparty and current exposure as of December 31, 2014. Factors considered in estimating the termination payments upon downgrade include current market conditions, the complexity of the derivative transactions, historical termination experience and other observable market events such as bankruptcy and downgrade events that have occurred at other companies. Our estimates are also based on the assumption that counterparties will terminate based on their net exposure to us. The actual termination payments could significantly differ from our estimates given market conditions at the time of downgrade and the level of uncertainty in estimating both the number of counterparties who may elect to exercise their right to terminate and the payment that may be triggered in connection with any such exercise.\n",
      "Hybrid Securities with Embedded Credit Derivatives\n",
      "We invest in hybrid securities (such as credit-linked notes) with the intent of generating income, and not specifically to acquire exposure to embedded derivative risk. As is the case with our other investments in RMBS, CMBS, CDOs and ABS, our\n",
      "Item 8 / note 11. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING\n",
      "investments in these hybrid securities are exposed to losses only up to the amount of our initial investment in the hybrid security. Other than our initial investment in the hybrid securities, we have no further obligation to make payments on the embedded credit derivatives in the related hybrid securities.\n",
      "We elect to account for our investments in these hybrid securities with embedded written credit derivatives at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in Net investment income and Other income. Our investments in these hybrid securities are reported as Other bond securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair values of these hybrid securities were $6.1 billion and $6.4 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These securities have par amounts of $12.3 billion and $13.4 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and both have remaining stated maturity dates that extend to 2052.\n",
      "12. GOODWILL\n",
      "Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. We assess goodwill for impairment at one level below our reportable segments. At December 31, 2014, in consideration of the 2014 segment changes, our reporting units with goodwill are Commercial Insurance - Property Casualty, Consumer Insurance - Personal Insurance, and Consumer Insurance - Life. When a business is transferred from one reporting unit to another, as occurred with the transfer of a portion of the Consumer Insurance - Personal Insurance to Consumer Insurance - Life, as part of the 2014 segment changes, goodwill at the original reporting unit is allocated among reporting units based on the fair value of business transferred, relative to business retained by a reporting unit.\n",
      "The impairment assessment involves an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment is not performed, or after assessing the totality of the events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment assessment involves a two-step process in which a quantitative assessment for potential impairment is performed.\n",
      "If the qualitative test is not performed or if the test indicates a potential impairment is present, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including allocated goodwill. The estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value involves management judgment and is based on one or a combination of approaches including discounted expected future cash flows, market-based earnings multiples of the unit’s peer companies, external appraisals or, in the case of reporting units being considered for sale, third-party indications of fair value, if available. We consider one or more of these estimates when determining the fair value of a reporting unit to be used in the impairment test.\n",
      "If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill associated with that reporting unit potentially is impaired. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts that would be assigned to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities in a hypothetical business combination. An impairment charge is recognized in earnings to the extent of the excess of carrying value over fair value.\n",
      "Goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 2014 based on the results of the goodwill impairment test.\n",
      "The following table presents the changes in goodwill by reportable segment:\n",
      "Item 8 / note 11. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING\n",
      "13. INSURANCE LIABILITIES\n",
      "Liability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\n",
      "The liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses represents the accumulation of estimates of unpaid claims, including estimates for claims incurred but not reported and claim adjustments expenses, less applicable discount for future investment income. We continually review and update the methods used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves. Any adjustments resulting from this review are reflected currently in pre-tax income. Because these estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are common given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development.\n",
      "Our gross loss reserves before reinsurance and discount are net of contractual deductible recoverable amounts due from policyholders of approximately $12.4 billion and $12.0 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These recoverable amounts are related to certain policies with high deductibles (primarily for U.S. commercial casualty business) where we manage and pay the entire claim on behalf of the insured and are reimbursed by the insured for the deductible portion of the claim. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, we held collateral totaling $9.4 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively, for these deductible recoverable amounts, consisting primarily of letters of credit and trust agreements.\n",
      "The following table presents the reconciliation of activity in the Liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses:\n",
      "Item 8 / note 12. GOODWILL\n",
      "(a) For the 2012 amounts, $847 million was reclassified from \"Foreign exchange effect\" to \"Losses and loss adjustment expenses paid (current year)\". The impact of this reclassification was a decrease of $847 million for foreign exchange and loss expenses paid (current year), with no income statement or balance sheet impact.\n",
      "(b) In 2014, included $545 million, $381 million, $(195) million, $135 million and $109 million related to primary casualty, environmental and asbestos, natural catastrophes, financial lines and healthcare, respectively. In 2013, included $(144) million, $269 million, $498 million and $(54) million related to excess casualty, environmental and pollution, primary casualty and healthcare, respectively. In 2012, includes $157 million, $200 million, $531 million and $68 million related to excess casualty, environmental and pollution, primary casualty and healthcare, respectively.\n",
      "(c) Includes amounts related to dispositions through the date of disposition.\n",
      "The net adverse development includes loss-sensitive business, for which we recognized $105 million, $89 million and $54 million loss-sensitive premium adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\n",
      "Discounting of Reserves\n",
      "At December 31, 2014, the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses reflects a net loss reserve discount of $3.1 billion, including tabular and non-tabular calculations based upon the following assumptions:\n",
      "• Certain asbestos business that was written by Non-Life Insurance Companies is discounted, when allowed by the regulator and when payments are fixed and determinable, based on the investment yields of the companies and the payout pattern for this business.\n",
      "• The tabular workers’ compensation discount is calculated based on a 3.5 percent interest rate and the 1999 U.S. Decennial Life Table.\n",
      "• The non-tabular workers’ compensation discount is calculated separately for companies domiciled in New York and Pennsylvania, and follows the statutory regulations (prescribed or permitted) for each state. For New York companies, the discount is based on a five percent interest rate and the companies’ own payout patterns. In 2012, for Pennsylvania companies, the statute has specified discount factors for accident years 2001 and prior, which are based on a six percent interest rate and an industry payout pattern. For accident years 2002 and subsequent, the discount is based on the payout patterns and investment yields of the companies.\n",
      "• Effective for the fourth quarter of 2013, our Pennsylvania regulator approved use of a consistent discount rate (U.S. Treasury rate plus a liquidity premium) to all of our workers’ compensation reserves in our Pennsylvania-domiciled companies, as well as our use of updated payout patterns specific to our primary and excess workers compensation portfolios. Prior to this change, workers’ compensation reserves held by a Pennsylvania-domiciled insurer were discounted as follows: i) For loss reserves associated with accident year 2001 and prior accident years, a prescribed discount factor based on a rate of 6 percent and industry payout patterns, were applied, ii) For loss reserves associated with accident year 2002 and subsequent accident years, a rate of 4.25 percent and our own payout patterns were applied; and iii) For a portion of loss reserves comprising excess workers' compensation reserves that were assumed into a Pennsylvania-domiciled insurer from New York-domiciled insurers during 2011, we applied New York discounting rules, which include a prescribed rate of five percent on case reserves only (no discounting of IBNR reserves).\n",
      "• In the fourth quarter of 2014, our Pennsylvania and Delaware regulators approved an updated discount rate that we applied to our workers’ compensation loss reserves for the legal entities domiciled in those states.\n",
      "The discount consists of the following: $852 million of tabular discount for workers’ compensation in the domestic operations of Non-Life Insurance Companies and $2.2 billion of non-tabular discount for workers’ compensation in the domestic operations of Non-Life Insurance Companies; and $11 million - non-tabular discount for asbestos for Non-Life Insurance Companies.\n",
      "Item 8 / note 13. INSURANCE LIABILITIES\n",
      "Future Policy Benefits\n",
      "Future policy benefits primarily include reserves for traditional life and annuity payout contracts, which represent an estimate of the present value of future benefits less the present value of future net premiums. Included in Future policy benefits are liabilities for annuities issued in structured settlement arrangements whereby a claimant has agreed to settle a general insurance claim in exchange for fixed payments over a fixed determinable period of time with a life contingency feature.\n",
      "Future policy benefits also include certain guaranteed benefits of variable annuity products that are not considered embedded derivatives, primarily guaranteed minimum death benefits. See Note 14 for additional information on guaranteed death benefits.\n",
      "The liability for long-duration future policy benefits has been established including assumptions for interest rates which vary by year of issuance and product, and range from approximately 1 percent to 12 percent. Mortality and surrender rate assumptions are generally based on actual experience when the liability is established.\n",
      "For universal life policies with secondary guarantees, we recognize a future policy benefit reserve, in addition to policyholder contract deposits, based on a benefit ratio of (a) the present value of total expected payments, in excess of the account value, over the life of the contract, divided by (b) the present value of total expected assessments over the life of the contract. For universal life policies without secondary guarantees, for which profits followed by losses are first expected after contract inception, we establish future policy benefit reserves, in addition to policyholder contract deposits, so that expected future losses are recognized in proportion to the emergence of profits in the earlier (profitable) years.\n",
      "Policyholder Contract Deposits\n",
      "The liability for Policyholder contract deposits is primarily recorded at accumulated value (deposits received and net transfers from separate accounts, plus accrued interest credited at rates ranging from 0.3% to 8.4% at December 31, 2014, less withdrawals and assessed fees). Deposits collected on investment-oriented products are not reflected as revenues, because they are recorded directly to Policyholder contract deposits upon receipt. Amounts assessed against the contract holders for mortality, administrative, and other services are included in revenues.\n",
      "In addition to liabilities for universal life, fixed annuities, fixed options within variable annuities, annuities without life contingencies, funding agreements and GICs, policyholder contract deposits also include our liability for (a) certain guaranteed benefits and indexed features accounted for as embedded derivatives at fair value, (b) annuities issued in a structured settlement arrangement with no life contingency and (c) certain contracts we have elected to account for at fair value. See Note 14 herein for additional information on guaranteed benefits accounted for as embedded derivatives.\n",
      "Under a funding agreement-backed notes issuance program, an unaffiliated, non-consolidated statutory trust issues medium-term notes to investors, which are secured by GICs issued to the trust by one of our Life Insurance Companies through our Institutional Markets operating segment. During the year ended December 31, 2014, a $450 million GIC was issued in conjunction with the funding agreement-backed notes program.\n",
      "The following table presents Policyholder contract deposits of the domestic Life Insurance Companies by product line:\n",
      "Item 8 / note 13. INSURANCE LIABILITIES\n",
      "Other Policyholder Funds\n",
      "Other policyholder funds include unearned revenue reserves (URR). URR consists of front-end loads on investment-oriented contracts, representing those policy loads that are non-level and typically higher in initial policy years than in later policy years. URR for investment-oriented contracts are generally deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits (EGPs) to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts and are subject to the same adjustments due to changes in the assumptions underlying EGPs as DAC. Amortization of URR is recorded in Policy Fees.\n",
      "Other policyholder funds also include provisions for future dividends to participating policyholders, accrued in accordance with all applicable regulatory or contractual provisions. Participating life business represented approximately 1.9 percent of the gross insurance in force at December 31, 2014 and 3.7 percent of gross Premiums and other considerations in 2014. The amount of annual dividends to be paid is approved locally by the boards of directors of the insurance companies. Provisions for future dividend payments are computed by jurisdiction, reflecting local regulations. The portions of current and prior net income and of current unrealized appreciation of investments that can inure to our benefit are restricted in some cases by the insurance contracts and by the local insurance regulations of the jurisdictions in which the policies are in force.\n",
      "Certain products are subject to experience adjustments. These include group life and group medical products, credit life contracts, accident and health insurance contracts/riders attached to life policies and, to a limited extent, reinsurance agreements with other direct insurers. Ultimate premiums from these contracts are estimated and recognized as revenue with the unearned portions of the premiums recorded as liabilities in Other policyholder funds. Experience adjustments vary according to the type of contract and the territory in which the policy is in force and are subject to local regulatory guidance.\n",
      "14. VARIABLE LIFE AND ANNUITY CONTRACTS\n",
      "We report variable contracts within the separate accounts when investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to, and investment risk is borne by, the contract holder and the separate account meets additional accounting criteria to qualify for separate account treatment. The assets supporting the variable portion of variable annuity and variable universal life contracts that qualify for separate account treatment are carried at fair value and reported as separate account assets, with an equivalent summary total reported as separate account liabilities.\n",
      "Policy values for variable products and investment contracts are expressed in terms of investment units. Each unit is linked to an asset portfolio. The value of a unit increases or decreases based on the value of the linked asset portfolio. The current liability at any time is the sum of the current unit value of all investment units in the separate accounts, plus any liabilities for guaranteed minimum death benefits or guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits included in Future policy benefits or Policyholder contract deposits, respectively.\n",
      "Amounts assessed against the contract holders for mortality, administrative and other services are included in revenue. Net investment income, net investment gains and losses, changes in fair value of assets, and policyholder account deposits and withdrawals related to separate accounts are excluded from the Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Cash Flows.\n",
      "Variable annuity contracts may include certain contractually guaranteed benefits to the contract holder. These guaranteed features include guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) that are payable in the event of death, and living benefits that are payable in the event of annuitization, or, in other instances, at specified dates during the accumulation period. Living benefits include guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB) and guaranteed minimum account value benefits (GMAV). A variable annuity contract may include more than one type of guaranteed benefit feature; for example, it may have both a GMDB and a GMWB. However, a policyholder can only receive payout from one guaranteed feature on a contract containing a death benefit and a living benefit, i.e. the features are mutually exclusive. A policyholder cannot purchase more than one living benefit on one contract. The net amount at risk for each feature is calculated irrespective of the existence of other features; as a result, the net amount at risk for each feature is not additive to that of other features.\n",
      "Account balances of variable annuity contracts with guarantees were invested in separate account investment options as follows:\n",
      "Item 8 / note 13. INSURANCE LIABILITIES\n",
      "GMDB and GMIB\n",
      "Depending on the contract, the GMDB feature may provide a death benefit of either (a) total deposits made to the contract less any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return (and in rare instances, no minimum return) or (b) the highest contract value attained, typically on any anniversary date minus any subsequent withdrawals following the contract anniversary. GMIB guarantees a minimum level of periodic income payments upon annuitization. GMDB is our most widely offered benefit; our contracts also include GMIB to a lesser extent.\n",
      "The liabilities for GMDB and GMIB, which are recorded in Future policyholder benefits, represent the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account value, with the excess recognized ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments, through Policyholder benefits and losses incurred. The net amount at risk for GMDB represents the amount of benefits in excess of account value if death claims were filed on all contracts on the balance sheet date.\n",
      "The following table presents details concerning our GMDB exposures, by benefit type:\n",
      "The following summarizes GMDB and GMIB liabilities related to variable annuity contracts:\n",
      "We regularly evaluate estimates used to determine the GMDB liability and adjust the additional liability balance, with a related charge or credit to Policyholder benefits and losses incurred, if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised.\n",
      "The following assumptions and methodology were used to determine the GMDB liability at December 31, 2014:\n",
      "• Data used was up to 1,000 stochastically generated investment performance scenarios.\n",
      "• Mean investment performance assumption was 8.5 percent.\n",
      "• Volatility assumption was 16 percent.\n",
      "• For certain products, mortality was assumed to be 85 percent of the 1983 variable annuity minimum guaranteed death benefit table, adjusted for recent experience. For other products, mortality was assumed to be 92 percent to 139 percent of the 2012 individual annuity mortality table.\n",
      "• Lapse rates vary by contract type and duration and ranged zero percent to 37 percent.\n",
      "Item 8 / note 14. VARIABLE LIFE AND ANNUITY CONTRACTS\n",
      "• The discount rate ranged from 3.75 percent to 10 percent and is based on the growth rate assumption for the underlying contracts in effect at the time of policy issuance.\n",
      "GMWB and GMAV\n",
      "Certain of our variable annuity contracts contain optional GMWB benefits and, to a lesser extent, GMAV benefits, which are not currently offered. With a GMWB, the contract holder can monetize the excess of the guaranteed amount over the account value of the contract only through a series of withdrawals that do not exceed a specific percentage per year of the guaranteed amount. If, after the series of withdrawals, the account value is exhausted, the contract holder will receive a series of annuity payments equal to the remaining guaranteed amount, and, for lifetime GMWB products, the annuity payments continue as long as the covered person(s) is living. With a GMAV benefit, the contract holder can monetize the excess of the guaranteed amount over the account value of the contract, provided the contract holder persists until the maturity date.\n",
      "The liabilities for GMWB and GMAV, which are recorded in Policyholder contract deposits, are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value of the liabilities recorded in Other net realized capital gains (losses). The fair value of these embedded derivatives was a net liability of $957 million at December 31, 2014 and a net asset of $37 million at December 31, 2013. See Note 5 herein for discussion of the fair value measurement of guaranteed benefits that are accounted for as embedded derivatives. We had account values subject to GMWB and GMAV that totaled $35 billion and $28.6 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The net amount at risk for GMWB represents the present value of minimum guaranteed withdrawal payments, in accordance with contract terms, in excess of account value, assuming no lapses. The net amount at risk for GMAV represents the present value of minimum guaranteed account value in excess of the current account balance, assuming no lapses. The net amount at risk related to these guarantees was $414 million and $63 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates. We use derivative instruments and other financial instruments to mitigate a portion of our exposure that arises from GMWB and GMAV benefits.\n",

In the normal course of business, AIG and our subsidiaries are, like others in the insurance and financial services industries in general, subject to litigation, including claims for punitive damages. In our insurance and mortgage guaranty operations, litigation arising from claims settlement activities is generally considered in the establishment of our liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. However, the potential for increasing jury awards and settlements makes it difficult to assess the ultimate outcome of such litigation. AIG is also subject to derivative, class action and other claims asserted by its shareholders and others alleging, among other things, breach of fiduciary duties by its directors and officers and violations of insurance laws and regulations, as well as federal and state securities laws. In the case of any derivative action brought on behalf of AIG, any recovery would accrue to the benefit of AIG.\n",

The consolidated complaint alleges that defendants made statements during the class period in press releases, AIG’s quarterly and year-end filings, during conference calls, and in various registration statements and prospectuses in connection with the various offerings that were materially false and misleading and that artificially inflated the price of AIG Common Stock. The alleged false and misleading statements relate to, among other things, the Subprime Exposure Issues. The consolidated complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act. On August 5, 2009, defendants filed motions to dismiss the consolidated complaint, and on September 27, 2010, the Court denied the motions to dismiss.\n",

The Court subsequently consolidated these eight actions as In re American International Group, Inc. ERISA Litigation II. On December 19, 2014, lead plaintiffs’ counsel filed under seal a third consolidated amended complaint.

In the third consolidated amended complaint, plaintiffs allege, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary responsibilities to plan participants and their beneficiaries under ERISA, by continuing to offer the AIG Stock Fund as an investment option in the plans after it allegedly became imprudent to do so. The alleged ERISA violations relate to, among other things, the defendants’ purported failure to monitor and/or disclose certain matters, including the Subprime Exposure Issues.\n",

The Supreme Court of Canada also suggested that in future cases, defendants may contest jurisdiction even when they are found to be doing business in a Canadian jurisdiction if their business activities in the jurisdiction are unrelated to the subject matter of the litigation.

(SICO) filed a complaint against the United States in the United States Court of Federal Claims (the Court of Federal Claims), bringing claims, both individually and on behalf of the classes defined below and derivatively on behalf of AIG (the SICO Treasury Action). The complaint challenges the government’s assistance of AIG, pursuant to which AIG entered into a credit facility with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the FRBNY, and such credit facility, the FRBNY Credit Facility) and the United States received an approximately 80 percent ownership in AIG. The complaint alleges that the interest rate imposed on AIG and the appropriation of approximately 80 percent of AIG’s equity was discriminatory, unprecedented, and inconsistent with liquidity assistance offered by the government to other comparable firms at the time and violated the Equal Protection, Due Process, and Takings Clauses of the U.S. Constitution.\n",
      "In rulings dated July 2, 2012 and September 17, 2012, the Court of Federal Claims largely denied the United States’ motion to dismiss in the SICO Treasury Action.\n",

On January 9, 2013, our Board unanimously refused SICO’s demand in its entirety and on January 23, 2013, counsel for the Board sent a letter to counsel for SICO describing the process by which our Board considered and refused SICO’s demand and stating the reasons for our Board’s determination.\n",
      "On March 11, 2013, SICO filed a second amended complaint in the SICO Treasury Action alleging that its demand was wrongfully refused.

SICO has provided notice of class certification to potential members of the classes, who, pursuant to a court order issued on April 25, 2013, had to return opt-in consent forms by September 16, 2013 to participate in either class. 286,908 holders of AIG Common Stock during the two class periods have opted into the classes.\n",

      "While AIG is no longer a party to the SICO Treasury Action, the United States has alleged, as an affirmative defense in its answer, that AIG is obligated to indemnify the FRBNY and its representatives, including the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the United States (as the FRBNY’s principal), for any recovery in the SICO Treasury Action, and seeks a contingent offset or recoupment for the value of net operating loss benefits the United States alleges that we received as a result of the government’s assistance. On November 8, 2013, the Court denied a motion by SICO to strike the United States’ affirmative defenses of indemnification and contingent offset or recoupment.\n",
      "AIG believes that any such indemnification obligation would arise only if: (a) SICO prevails on its claims at trial and receives an award of damages and prevails through any appellate process; (b) the United States commences an action against AIG seeking indemnification; and (c) the United States is successful in such an action through any appellate process. If SICO prevails on its claims and the United States seeks indemnification from AIG, AIG intends to assert defenses thereto. A final determination that the United States is liable for damages, together with a final determination that AIG is obligated to indemnify the United States for any such damages, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\n",

Relators filed a first amended complaint on September 30, 2010, adding certain additional defendants, including Bank of America and Société Générale. The first amended complaint alleged that defendants engaged in fraudulent business practices in respect of their activities in the over-the-counter market for collateralized debt obligations, and submitted false claims to the United States in connection with the FRBNY Credit Facility and Maiden Lane II LLC (ML II) and Maiden Lane III LLC entities (the Maiden Lane Interests) through, among other things, misrepresenting AIG’s ability and intent to repay amounts drawn on the FRBNY Credit Facility, and misrepresenting the value of the securities that the Maiden Lane Interests acquired from AIG and certain of its counterparties. The first amended complaint sought unspecified damages pursuant to the False Claims Act in the amount of three times the damages allegedly sustained by the United States as well as interest, attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses. The complaint and the first amended complaint were initially filed and maintained under seal while the United States considered whether to intervene in the action. On or about April 28, 2011, after the United States declined to intervene, the District Court lifted the seal, and Relators served the first amended complaint on AIG on July 11, 2011. On April 19, 2013, the Court granted AIG’s motion to dismiss, dismissing the first amended complaint in its entirety, without prejudice, giving the Relators the opportunity to file a second amended complaint. On May 24, 2013, the Relators filed a second amended complaint, which attempted to plead the same claims as the prior complaints and did not specify an amount of alleged damages. AIG and its co-defendants filed motions to dismiss the second amended complaint on August 9, 2013. On March 29, 2014, the Court dismissed the second amended complaint with prejudice.

(Caremark). The plaintiffs in the second-filed action intervened in the first-filed action, and the second-filed action was dismissed. An excess policy issued by a subsidiary of AIG with respect to the 1999 litigation was expressly stated to be without limit of liability. In the current actions, plaintiffs allege that the judge approving the 1999 settlement was misled as to the extent of available insurance coverage and would not have approved the settlement had he known of the existence and/or unlimited nature of the excess policy. They further allege that AIG, its subsidiaries, and Caremark are liable for fraud and suppression for misrepresenting and/or concealing the nature and extent of coverage.\n",
      "The complaints filed by the plaintiffs and the intervenors request compensatory damages for the 1999 class in the amount of $3.2 billion, plus punitive damages. AIG and its subsidiaries deny the allegations of fraud and suppression, assert that information concerning the excess policy was publicly disclosed months prior to the approval of the settlement, that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations, and that the statute cannot be tolled in light of the public disclosure of the excess coverage. The plaintiffs and intervenors, in turn, have asserted that the disclosure was insufficient to inform them of the nature of the coverage and did not start the running of the statute of limitations.\n",
      "On August 15, 2012, the trial court entered an order granting plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, and on September 12, 2014, the Alabama Supreme Court affirmed that order.

In late 2007, the Settlement Review Working Group, under the direction of Indiana, Minnesota and Rhode Island, recommended that a multi-state targeted market conduct examination focusing on workers’ compensation insurance be commenced under the\n",
      "Item 8 / note 16. CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES\n",
      "direction of the NAIC’s Market Analysis Working Group. AIG was informed of the multi-state targeted market conduct examination in January 2008. The lead states in the multi-state examination were Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. All other states (and the District of Columbia) agreed to participate in the multi-state examination. The examination focused on legacy issues related to certain AIG entities’ writing and reporting of workers compensation insurance between 1985 and 1996.\n",
      "On December 17, 2010, AIG and the lead states reached an agreement to settle all regulatory liabilities arising out of the subjects of the multistate examination. This regulatory settlement agreement, which was agreed to by all 50 states and the District of Columbia, included, among other terms, (i) AIG’s payment of $100 million in regulatory fines and penalties; (ii) AIG’s payment of $46.5 million in outstanding premium taxes and assessments; (iii) AIG’s agreement to enter into a compliance plan describing agreed-upon specific steps and standards for evaluating AIG’s ongoing compliance with state regulations governing the setting of workers’ compensation insurance premium rates and the reporting of workers compensation premiums; and (iv) AIG’s agreement to pay up to $150 million in contingent fines in the event that AIG fails to comply substantially with the compliance plan requirements. In furtherance of the compliance plan, the agreement provided for a monitoring period from May 29, 2012 to May 29, 2014 leading up to a compliance plan examination. After the close of the monitoring period, as part of preparation for the actual conduct of the compliance plan examination, on or about October 1, 2014, AIG and the lead states agreed upon corrective action plans to address particular issues identified during the monitoring period. The compliance plan examination is ongoing. There can be no assurance that the result of the compliance plan examination will not result in a fine, have a material adverse effect on AIG’s ongoing operations or lead to civil litigation.\n",
      "In connection with a multi-state examination of certain accident and health products, including travel products, issued by National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa. (National Union), AIG Property Casualty Inc. (formerly Chartis Inc.), on behalf of itself, National Union, and certain of AIG Property Casualty Inc.’s insurance and non-insurance companies (collectively, the AIG PC parties) entered into a Regulatory Settlement Agreement with regulators from 50 U.S. jurisdictions effective November 29, 2012. Under the agreement, and without admitting any liability for the issues raised in the examination, the AIG PC parties (i) paid a civil penalty of $50 million, (ii) entered into a corrective action plan describing agreed-upon specific steps and standards for evaluating the AIG PC parties’ ongoing compliance with laws and regulations governing the issues identified in the examination, and (iii) agreed to pay a contingent fine in the event that the AIG PC parties fail to satisfy certain terms of the corrective action plan. National Union and other AIG companies are also currently subject to civil litigation relating to the conduct of their accident and health business, and may be subject to additional litigation relating to the conduct of such business from time to time in the ordinary course. There can be no assurance that any regulatory action resulting from the issues identified will not have a material adverse effect on our ongoing operations of the business subject to the agreement, or on similar business written by other AIG carriers.\n",
      "Industry-wide examinations conducted by the Minnesota Department of Insurance and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on captive reinsurance practices by lenders and mortgage insurance companies, including UGC, have been ongoing for several years. In 2011, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) assumed responsibility for violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act from HUD, and assumed HUD’s aforementioned ongoing investigation. UGC and the CFPB reached a settlement, entered on April 8, 2013 by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, where UGC consented to discontinue its remaining captive reinsurance practices and to pay a civil monetary penalty of $4.5 million to the CFPB. The settlement includes a release for all liability related to UGC’s captive reinsurance practices and resolves the CFPB’s investigation. On January 31, 2014, PHH Corp. and various affiliates (all non-parties to the action and the consent order) filed a motion to reopen the case and to intervene therein for the limited purpose of obtaining a declaratory judgment enforcing the consent order. UGC opposed this request, and on March 10, 2014, the Court denied PHH Corp.’s motion. PHH Corp. has appealed to the Eleventh Circuit.\n",
      "UGC has received a proposed consent order from the Minnesota Commissioner of Commerce (the MN Commissioner) which alleges that UGC violated the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and other state laws in connection with its practices with captive reinsurance companies owned by lenders. UGC is engaged in discussions with the MN Commissioner with respect to the terms of the proposed consent order. UGC cannot predict if or when a consent order may be entered into or, if entered into, what the terms of the final consent order will be. UGC has been subject to civil litigation relating to its placement of reinsurance with captives owned by lenders, and may be subject to additional litigation relating to the conduct of such business from time to time in the ordinary course.\n",

      "Company (DelAm), and other related business units, which were sold by AIG to MetLife in November 2010. The inquiries relate to whether ALICO, DelAm and their representatives conducted insurance business in New York over an extended period of time without a license, and whether certain representations by ALICO concerning its activities in New York were accurate. On or about March 31, 2014, a consent order between MetLife and the NYDFS, whereby MetLife agreed to pay $50 million, and a deferred prosecution agreement with the NYDA, whereby MetLife agreed to pay $10 million, were announced. AIG was not a party to either settlement. The consent order between the NYDFS and MetLife made certain findings, including that former AIG subsidiaries and affiliates conducted insurance business in New York without a license and that ALICO, while operating as a subsidiary of AIG, made misrepresentations and omissions concerning its insurance business activities in New York to NYDFS’s predecessor agency, the New York State Department of Insurance. The NYDFS also found in the consent order that AIG had violated the New York Insurance Law. On April 3, 2014, AIG filed a complaint against the NYDFS and NYDFS Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky in the Southern District of New York, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the basis that the NYDFS’s interpretation of the New York Insurance Law is unconstitutional under the Due Process and Commerce Clauses, as well as the First Amendment, of the U.S. Constitution. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the federal complaint on May 16, 2014. On October 31, 2014, AIG and NYDFS entered into a Consent Order, whereby AIG agreed to pay $35 million and dismiss the federal lawsuit in exchange for NYDFS’s agreement to discontinue its inquiry.\n",
      "On May 12, 2010, a complaint was filed under seal in the Southern District of New York by an individual (Relator) seeking to assert claims on behalf of the United States against AIG under the False Claims Act. The Relator filed also under seal a first amended complaint on July 28, 2011. The complaint and the first amended complaint were initially filed and maintained under seal while the United States considered whether to intervene in the action, and on or about October 29, 2013, after the United States declined to intervene, the District Court ordered the complaint be unsealed 30 days after the entry of the order. The case, however, was not unsealed until May 9, 2014. The Relator thereafter served his second amended complaint on AIG on May 23, 2014. The second amended complaint alleges that AIG made false statements relevant to the valuation of two of its former subsidiaries, ALICO and American International Assurance Limited (AIA), in connection with agreements under which interests in those subsidiaries were transferred to the FRBNY in exchange for a $25 billion decrease in the amount owed to the FRBNY under the FRBNY Credit Facility. Specifically, it alleges that AIG falsely told the federal government that ALICO and AIA had the licenses they needed to conduct their business and were in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. AIG moved to dismiss the Relator’s second amended complaint on December 22, 2014.\n",

Estimation of ultimate net losses, loss expenses and loss reserves is a complex process, particularly for long-tail casualty lines of business, which include, but are not limited to, general liability, commercial automobile liability, environmental, workers’ compensation, excess casualty and crisis management coverages, insurance and risk management programs for large corporate customers and other customized structured insurance products, as well as excess and umbrella liability, directors and officers and products liability. Generally, actual historical loss development factors are used to project future loss development. However, there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns will be the same as in the past. Moreover, any deviation in loss cost trends or in loss development factors might not be identified for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. Reserves with respect to a number of years may be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors that were relied upon in setting the reserves.

The total amount outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2014 was $214 million. In those transactions, AIGFP has agreed to pay the equity termination value if the lessee fails to pay. The amount payable by AIGFP is, in certain cases, partially offset by amounts payable under other instruments typically equal to the present value of scheduled payments to be made by AIGFP. In the event that AIGFP is required to make a payment to the equity investor, the lessee is unconditionally obligated to reimburse AIGFP. To the extent that the equity investor is paid the equity termination value from the standby letter of credit and/or other sources, including payments by the lessee, AIGFP takes an assignment of the equity investor’s rights under the lease of the underlying property. Because the obligations of the lessee under the lease transactions are generally economically defeased, lessee bankruptcy is the most likely circumstance in which AIGFP would be required to pay without reimbursement.\n",

As part of the Recapitalization, we used approximately $6.1 billion of the cash proceeds from the sale of ALICO to pay down a portion of the liquidation preference of the SPV Preferred Interests. The liquidation preference of the SPV Preferred Interests was further reduced by approximately $12.4 billion using proceeds from the sale of AIG Star, AIG Edison, Nan Shan, and MetLife securities received in the sale of ALICO.

      "Our insurance subsidiaries file financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by domestic and foreign insurance regulatory authorities. The principal differences between statutory financial statements and financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for domestic companies are that statutory financial statements do not reflect DAC, some bond portfolios may be carried at amortized cost, investment impairments are determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices, assets and liabilities are presented net of reinsurance, policyholder liabilities are generally valued using more conservative assumptions and certain assets are non-admitted.\n",
      "For domestic insurance subsidiaries, aggregate minimum required statutory capital and surplus is based on the greater of the RBC level that would trigger regulatory action or minimum requirements per state insurance regulation. Capital and surplus requirements of our foreign subsidiaries differ from those prescribed in the U.S., and can vary significantly by jurisdiction. At both December 31, 2014 and 2013, all domestic and foreign insurance subsidiaries individually exceeded the minimum required statutory capital and surplus requirements and all domestic insurance subsidiaries individually exceeded RBC minimum required levels.\n",
      "At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the use of prescribed or permitted statutory accounting practices by our domestic and foreign insurance subsidiaries did not result in reported statutory surplus or risk-based capital that is significantly different from the statutory surplus or risk-based capital that would have been reported had NAIC statutory accounting practices or the prescribed regulatory accounting practices of their respective foreign regulatory authority been followed in all respects for domestic and foreign insurance entities. As described in Note 13, our domestic insurance subsidiaries domiciled in New York and Pennsylvania discount non-tabular workers’ compensation reserves based on the prescribed or approved regulations in each of those states. While these practices differ from applicable NAIC statutory accounting practices, such practices do not have a material impact on our statutory surplus and statutory net income (loss) or risk based capital.\n",
      "The NAIC Model Regulation “Valuation of Life Insurance Policies” (Regulation XXX) requires U.S. life insurers to establish additional statutory reserves for term life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees and universal life policies with secondary guarantees (ULSGs). In addition, NAIC Actuarial Guideline 38 (Guideline AXXX) clarifies the application of Regulation XXX as to these guarantees, including certain ULSGs.\n",
      "Domestic insurance subsidiaries manage the capital impact of statutory reserve requirements under Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX through intercompany reinsurance transactions. The affiliated life insurers providing reinsurance capacity for such transactions are fully licensed insurance companies and are not formed under captive insurance laws. Under one of these intercompany reinsurance arrangements, certain Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX reserves related to new and in-force business are ceded to an affiliated U.S. life insurer, which is a licensed life insurer in the state of Missouri and an accredited reinsurer in the state of Texas. As an accredited reinsurer, this affiliated life insurer is not required to post any collateral such as letters of credit or assets in trust.\n",
      "Under the other intercompany reinsurance arrangement, certain Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX reserves related to a closed block of in-force business are ceded to an affiliated off-shore life insurer, which is licensed as a class E insurer under Bermuda law. Bermuda law permits the off-shore life insurer to record an asset that effectively reduces the statutory reserves for the assumed reinsurance to the level that would be required under U.S. GAAP. Letters of credit are used to support the credit for reinsurance provided by the affiliated off-shore life insurer.

For example, unless permitted by the Superintendent of Financial Services, property casualty companies domiciled in New York generally may not pay dividends to shareholders that, in any 12-month period, exceed the lesser of 10 percent of such company’s statutory policyholders’ surplus or 100 percent of its “adjusted net investment income,” for the previous year, as defined. Generally, less severe restrictions applicable to both property casualty and life insurance companies exist in most of the other states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled. Under the laws of many states, an insurer may pay a dividend without prior approval of the insurance regulator when the amount of the dividend is below certain regulatory thresholds. Other foreign jurisdictions may restrict the ability of our foreign insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends. Various other regulatory restrictions also limit cash loans and advances to us by our subsidiaries.\n",
      "Largely as a result of these restrictions, approximately $45.8 billion of the statutory capital and surplus of our consolidated insurance subsidiaries were restricted from transfer to AIG Parent without prior approval of state insurance regulators at December 31, 2014.\n",
      "To our knowledge, no AIG insurance company is currently on any regulatory or similar “watch list” with regard to solvency.\n",

      "* For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, $86 million, $315 million and $286 million of pre-tax compensation expense was attributed to unsettled liability-classified awards, the values of which are based on our share price at the reporting date. Our share price was $56.01, $51.05 and $35.30 at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition, we recognized $120 million and $101 million for immediately vested stock-settled awards issued to retirement eligible employees in 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n",
      "Employee Plans\n",
      "During 2014 and 2013, our employees were issued awards under the 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan, which is governed by the AIG 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (2013 Plan). The 2013 Plan replaced the AIG 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (2010 Plan) as of May 15, 2013, but does not affect the terms or conditions of any award issued under the 2010 Plan. The 2013 Plan is currently the only plan under which share-based awards can be made.\n",

The total number of shares that may be granted under the 2013 Plan (the reserve) is the sum of 1) 45 million shares of AIG Common Stock, plus 2) the number of authorized shares that remained available for issuance under the 2010 Plan when the 2013 Plan became effective, plus 3) the number of shares of AIG Common Stock relating to outstanding awards under the 2010 Plan at the time the 2013 Plan became effective that subsequently are forfeited, expired, terminated or otherwise lapse or are settled in cash. Each share-based unit granted under the 2013 Plan reduces the number of shares available for future grants by one share. However, shares with respect to awards that are forfeited, expired or settled for cash, and shares withheld for taxes on awards (other than options and stock appreciation rights (SARs) awards) are returned to the reserve.\n",
      "During 2014, performance share units (PSUs) and deferred stock units (DSUs) were granted under the 2013 Plan and 50,206,557 shares are available for future grants as of December 31, 2014. PSUs were issued for off-cycle grants, which are made from time to time during the year as sign-on awards to new hires or as a result of a change in employee status.\n",
      "AIG 2010 Stock Incentive Plan\n",
      "The 2010 Plan was adopted at the 2010 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The total number of shares of AIG Common Stock that could be granted under the 2010 Plan was 60 million. During 2013 and 2012, we granted PSUs, DSUs, and restricted stock units (RSUs), under the 2010 Plan. Each PSU, DSU, and RSU, awarded reduced the number of shares available for future grants by one share. Subsequent to the adoption of the 2013 Plan in May 2013, no additional grants were made under the 2010 Plan.\n",

      "AIG 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan\n",
      "The 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan (2013 LTIP), adopted in March 2013, provides for the annual grant of PSUs to certain employees, including our senior executive officers and other highly compensated employees. Each recipient of an award is granted a number of PSUs (the target) that provides the opportunity to receive shares of AIG Common Stock based on AIG achieving specified performance goals at the end of a three-year performance period. These performance goals are pre-established by AIG’s Compensation and Management Resources Committee for each annual grant and may differ from year to year. The actual number of PSUs earned can vary from zero to 150 percent of the target depending on AIG’s performance relative to a specified peer group. Vesting occurs in three equal installments beginning on January 1 of the year immediately following the end of a performance period and January 1 of each of the next two years. Dividends do not accrue on unvested PSUs or underlying shares. Recipients must be employed at each vesting date to be entitled to share delivery, except upon the occurrence of an accelerated vesting event, such as an involuntary termination without cause, disability, or retirement during the vesting period.\n",
      "SICO Plans\n",
      "The SICO Plans provide that shares of AIG Common Stock currently held by SICO are set aside for the benefit of the participant and distributed upon retirement. The SICO Board of Directors currently may permit an early payout of shares under certain circumstances. Prior to payout, the participant is not entitled to vote, dispose of or receive dividends with respect to such shares, and shares are subject to forfeiture under certain conditions, including but not limited to the participant’s termination of employment with us prior to normal retirement age. A significant portion of the awards under the SICO Plans vest the year after the participant reaches age 65, provided that the participant remains employed by us through age 65. The portion of the awards for which early payout is available vests on the applicable payout date.\n",
      "SICO Plan awards issued in the form of restricted stock were valued based on the closing price of AIG’s Common Stock on the grant date. Although none of the costs of the various benefits provided under the SICO Plans have been paid by us, we have\n",

      "Non-Employee Plans\n",
      "Our non-employee directors, who serve on our Board of Directors, receive share-based compensation in the form of fully vested deferred stock units (DSUs) with delivery deferred until retirement from the Board. In 2014 and 2013, we granted to non-employee directors 28,477 and 25,735 DSUs, respectively, under the 2013 Plan and recognized expense of $1.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively; in 2012, we granted 19,434 DSUs, under the 2010 Plan and recognized $0.6 million of expense.\n",
      "Performance Share Unit Valuation\n",
      "The performance goals for long-term incentive awards granted in 2014 are AIG’s total shareholder return (TSR) and change in credit default swap (CDS) spread, weighted 75 percent and 25 percent, respectively, in each case relative to a specified peer group. The goals for the 2013 awards are AIG’s growth in tangible book value per share (TBVPS) (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income) and TSR, weighted 50 percent each, in each case relative to a specified peer group. The fair value of PSUs to be earned based on AIG’s achieving growth in TBVPS and change in CDS spreads was based on the closing price of AIG Common Stock on the grant date, discounted by the present value of estimated dividends to be paid during the respective vesting periods. The fair value of PSUs to be earned based on AIG’s TSR relative to a specified peer group was determined on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation.\n",
      "The following table presents the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of PSUs based on AIG’s TSR:\n",
      "(a) The dividend yield is the projected annualized AIG dividend yield estimated by Bloomberg Professional service as of the valuation date.\n",
      "(b) The expected volatility is based on the implied volatilities of actively traded stock options from the valuation date through the end of the PSU performance period as estimated by Bloomberg Professional service.\n",
      "(c) The risk-free interest rate is the continuously compounded interest rate for the term between the valuation date and the end of the performance period that is assumed to be constant and equal to the interpolated value between the closest data points on the U.S. dollar LIBOR-swap curve as of the valuation date.\n",

      "At December 31, 2014, the total unrecognized compensation cost (net of expected forfeitures) for the unvested PSUs and unvested restricted stock was $185 million and $19 million, respectively, and the weighted-average and expected period of years over which those costs are expected to be recognized are 1.28 years and 4 years for the PSUs, and 5.28 years and 25 years for the restricted stock, respectively.\n",

      "Stock Options\n",
      "Options granted under the AIG 2007 Stock Incentive Plan and the 1999 Stock Option Plan generally vested over four years (25 percent vesting per year) and expire 10 years from the date of grant. All outstanding options are vested and out of the money at December 31, 2014. There were no stock options granted since 2008. The aggregate intrinsic value for all unexercised options is zero.\n",
      "The following table provides a roll forward of stock option activity:\n",
      "Cash-settled Awards\n",
      "Share-based cash-settled awards are recorded as liabilities until the final payout is made or the award is replaced with a stock-settled award. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting periods, unless the award is fully vested on the grant date in which case the entire award value is immediately recognized as expense.\n",
      "Unlike stock-settled awards, which generally have a fixed grant-date fair value (unless the award is subsequently modified), the fair value of unsettled or unvested cash-settled awards is remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the change in fair value of one share of AIG Common Stock. The liability and corresponding expense are adjusted accordingly until the award is settled.\n",
      "During the period we were subject to Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) restrictions, we issued various cash-settled share-based grants, including Stock Salary, TARP RSU awards, and other cash-settled RSU awards, to certain of our most highly compensated employees and executive officers in the form of restricted stock units that were either fully vested with payment deferred, or subject to specified service and performance conditions. After the repayment of our TARP obligations in December 2012, all performance conditions were satisfied; as a result, we no longer issue awards that are subject to TARP restrictions.\n",
      "Restricted Stock Units\n",
      "Stock Salary Awards\n",
      "Stock Salary was earned and accrued at the same time or times as the salary would otherwise be paid in cash and is generally settled in installments on the first, second or third anniversary of grant in accordance with the terms of an employee’s award. Stock Salary grants were generally issued in the form of fully vested RSUs and are settled in cash based on the value of AIG Common Stock on the applicable settlement date. During 2014, 2013 and 2012, we paid $89 million, $180 million and $111 million, respectively, to settle awards. For those awards that were vested and unsettled at the end of each year, we recognized charges of $7 million, $73 million and $173 million in compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, to reflect fluctuations in the value of AIG Common Stock. At December 31, 2014, the number of vested but unsettled RSUs totaled 742,317.\n",

      "TARP and Other RSUs\n",
      "TARP RSUs awarded require the achievement of objective performance metrics as a condition to entitlement. An award would have been settled in 25 percent installments in proportion to the repayment of our TARP obligations. As a result of the repayment of our TARP obligations in December 2012, outstanding awards vest and settle in two 50 percent installments on the second and third anniversary of the date of grant, along with other cash-settled RSUs granted and issued in March 2013 and 2012.\n",

      "Certain employees were provided the opportunity to receive additional compensation in the form of cash and cash-settled SARs under the 2011 LTIP or 100 percent cash for the 2012 LTIP if certain performance measures were met. The ultimate value of these awards was contingent on AIG achieving performance measures over a two-year performance period and such value could range from zero to twice the target amount. Subsequent to the performance period, the earned awards were subject to an additional time-vesting period. This results in a graded vesting schedule for the cash portion of up to two years, while the SARs portion cliff-vests two years after the end of performance period.\n",
      "The cash portion of the awards expensed in 2014, 2013 and 2012 totaled approximately $57 million, $249 million, and $189 million, respectively.\n",

      "(d) The ending balance represents awards granted under the 2011 LTIP that vested on January 1, 2015 and were automatically exercised. The value of a SAR as of December 31, 2014 was determined based on the excess of the fair value (as defined) of one share of AIG Common Stock over the strike price of $37.40; the fair value was $55.29 based on the average of the closing sale prices on each trading day during the month of December 2014 in accordance with the plan provisions.

      "Pension Plans\n",
      "We offer various defined benefit plans to eligible employees.\n",
      "The U.S. AIG Retirement Plan (the qualified plan) is a noncontributory defined benefit plan, that is subject to the provisions of ERISA. U.S. salaried employees who are employed by a participating company and who have completed 12 months of continuous service are eligible to participate in the plan. Effective April 1, 2012, the qualified plan was converted to a cash balance formula comprised of pay credits based on six percent of a plan participant’s annual compensation (subject to IRS limitations) and annual interest credits. In addition, employees can take their vested benefits when they leave AIG as a lump sum or an annuity option after completing at least three years of service. However, employees satisfying certain age and service requirements (i.e. grandfathered employees) remain covered under the old plan formula, which is based upon a\n",
      "Item 8 / note 21. SHARE-BASED AND OTHER COMPENSATION PLANS\n",
      "percentage of final average compensation multiplied by years of credited service, up to 44 years. Grandfathered employees will receive the higher of the benefits under the cash balance or final average pay formula at retirement. Non-U.S. defined benefit plans are generally either based on the employee’s years of credited service and compensation in the years preceding retirement or on points accumulated based on the employee’s job grade and other factors during each year of service.\n",
      "In the U.S. we also sponsor several non-qualified unfunded defined benefit plans for certain employees, including key executives, designed to supplement pension benefits provided by the qualified plan. These include the AIG Non-Qualified Retirement Income Plan (AIG NQRIP), which provides a benefit equal to the reduction in benefits under the qualified plan as a result of federal tax limitations on compensation and benefits payable, and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP), which provides additional retirement benefits to designated executives. Under the SERP, an annual benefit accrues at a percentage of final average pay multiplied by each year of credited service, not greater than 60 percent of final average pay, reduced by any benefits from the current and any predecessor retirement plans (including the AIG NQRIP), Social Security, and any benefits accrued under a Company sponsored foreign deferred compensation plan.\n",
      "Postretirement Plans\n",
      "We also provide postretirement medical care and life insurance benefits in the U.S. and in certain non-U.S. countries. Eligibility in the various plans is generally based upon completion of a specified period of eligible service and attaining a specified age. Overseas, benefits vary by geographic location.\n",
      "U.S. postretirement medical and life insurance benefits are based upon the employee attaining the age of 55 and having a minimum of ten years of service. Eligible employees who have medical coverage can enroll in retiree medical upon termination of employment. Medical benefits are contributory, while the life insurance benefits are generally non-contributory. Retiree medical contributions vary from none for pre-1989 retirees to actual premium payments reduced by certain subsidies for post-1992 retirees. These contributions are subject to adjustment annually. Other cost sharing features of the medical plan include deductibles, coinsurance and Medicare coordination. Effective April 1, 2012, the retiree medical employer subsidy for the AIG Postretirement plan was eliminated for employees who were not grandfathered. Additionally, new employees hired after December 31, 2012 are not eligible for retiree life insurance.\n",
      "The following table presents the funded status of the plans reconciled to the amount reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The measurement date for most of the non-U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement plans is November 30, consistent with the fiscal year end of the sponsoring companies. For all other plans, measurement occurs as of December 31.\n",

      "The estimated net loss and prior service credit that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $141 million and $35 million, respectively, for our combined defined benefit pension plans. For the defined benefit postretirement plans, the estimated amortization from Accumulated other comprehensive income for net loss and prior service credit that will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year is a $10 million credit in the aggregate.\n",
      "The annual pension expense in 2015 for the AIG U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans is expected to be approximately $289 million. A 100 basis point increase in the discount rate or expected long-term rate of return would decrease the 2015 expense by approximately $95 million and $47 million, respectively, with all other items remaining the same. Conversely, a 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate or expected long-term rate of return would increase the 2015 expense by approximately $104 million and $47 million, respectively, with all other items remaining the same.\n",

      "Our postretirement plans provide benefits primarily in the form of defined employer contributions rather than defined employer benefits. Changes in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate have a minimal impact for U.S. plans because for post-1992 retirees, benefits are fixed dollar amounts based on service at retirement. Our non-U.S. postretirement plans are not subject to caps.\n",

      "Discount Rate Methodology\n",
      "The projected benefit cash flows under the U.S. AIG Retirement plan were discounted using the spot rates derived from the Mercer Pension Discount Yield Curve at December 31, 2014 and 2013, which resulted in a single discount rate that would produce the same liability at the respective measurement dates. The discount rates were 3.95 percent at December 31, 2014 and 4.84 percent at December 31, 2013. The methodology was consistently applied for the respective years in determining the discount rates for the other U.S. plans.\n",
      "In general, the discount rates for non-U.S. pension plans were developed based on the duration of liabilities on a plan by plan basis and were selected by reference to high quality corporate bonds in developed markets or local government bonds where developed markets are not as robust or are nonexistent.\n",
      "The projected benefit obligation for Japan represents approximately 47 percent and 51 percent of the total projected benefit obligations for our non-U.S. pension plans at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The weighted average discount rate of 1.22 percent and 1.39 percent at December 31, 2014 and 2013 respectively for Japan was selected by reference to the AA rated corporate bonds reported by Rating and Investment Information, Inc. based on the duration of the plans’ liabilities.\n",
      "Plan Assets\n",
      "The investment strategy with respect to assets relating to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans is designed to achieve investment returns that will (a) provide for the benefit obligations of the plans over the long term (b) limit the risk of short-term funding shortfalls and (c) maintain liquidity sufficient to address cash needs. Accordingly, the asset allocation strategy is designed to maximize the investment rate of return while managing various risk factors, including but not limited to, volatility relative to the benefit obligations, diversification and concentration, and the risk and rewards profile applicable to each asset class. The assessment of the expected rate of return for all our plans is long-term and thus is not expected to change annually; however, significant changes in investment strategy or economic conditions may warrant such a change.\n",

The expected rate of return is an aggregation of expected returns within each asset class category and incorporates the current and target asset allocations. The combination of the expected asset return and any contributions made by us are expected to maintain the plan’s ability to meet all required benefit obligations.

      "The assets of AIG’s Japan pension plans represent approximately 55 percent and 60 percent of total non-U.S. assets at December 31, 2014 and 2013 respectively. The expected long term rate of return was 1.24 percent and 1.15 percent, for 2014 and 2013, respectively, and is evaluated by the Japanese Pension Investment Committee on a quarterly and annual basis along with various investment managers, and is revised to achieve the optimal allocation to meet targeted funding levels if necessary. In addition, the funding policy is revised in accordance with local regulation every five years.\n",
      "The expected weighted average long-term rate of return for all our non-U.S. pension plans was 2.93 percent and 2.60 percent for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2014, we transferred certain investments in hedge funds into Level 3 as a result of limited market activity due to fund-imposed redemption restrictions.\n",

      "Funding for the U.S. pension plan ranges from the minimum amount required by ERISA to the maximum amount that would be deductible for U.S. tax purposes. Contributed amounts in excess of the minimum amounts are deemed voluntary. Amounts in excess of the maximum amount would be subject to an excise tax and may not be deductible under the Internal Revenue Code. There are no minimum required cash contributions in 2015 for the AIG Retirement Plan. SERP, AIG NQRIP, and postretirement plan payments are deductible when paid to participants.\n",
      "Our annual pension contribution in 2015 is expected to be approximately $173 million for our U.S. and non-U.S. plans, including a $100 million contribution to the AIG Retirement Plan. These estimates are subject to change, since contribution decisions are affected by various factors including our liquidity, market performance and management’s discretion.\n",
      "The expected future benefit payments, net of participants’ contributions, with respect to the defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, are as follows:\n",
      "Defined Contribution Plans\n",
      "We sponsor several defined contribution plans for U.S. employees that provide for pre-tax salary reduction contributions by employees. The most significant plan is the AIG Incentive Savings Plan, for which the Company’s matching contribution is 100 percent of the first six percent of a participant’s contributions, subject to the IRS-imposed limitations. Our pre-tax expenses associated with these plans were $156 million, $155 million and $133 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012 respectively.\n",

Berkowitz and various investment vehicles managed by Fairholme Capital Management, L.L.C.\n",

      "For the year ended December 31, 2014, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 27.9 percent. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits of $236 million associated with tax exempt interest income, $209 million related to a decrease in the U.S. Life Insurance Companies’ capital loss carryforward valuation allowance, $182 million of income excludible from gross income\n",
      "Item 8 / note 24. INCOME TAXES\n",
      "related to the global resolution of certain residential mortgage-related disputes and $68 million associated with effect of foreign operations.\n",
      "For the year ended December 31, 2013, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 3.8 percent. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits of $2.8 billion related to a decrease in the U.S. Life Insurance Companies’ capital loss carryforward valuation allowance, $396 million related to a decrease in certain other valuation allowances associated with foreign jurisdictions and $298 million associated with tax exempt interest income. These items were partially offset by charges of $632 million related to uncertain tax positions.\n",
      "For the year ended December 31, 2012, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was (27.9) percent. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to decreases in the U.S. Life Insurance Companies’ capital loss carryforward valuation allowance of $1.9 billion related to the actual and projected gains from the U.S. Life Insurance Companies’ available-for-sale securities, and tax effects associated with tax exempt interest income of $302 million. These items were partially offset by changes in uncertain tax positions of $446 million.\n",

      "Assessment of Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance\n",
      "The evaluation of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires us to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax\n",
      "Item 8 / note 24. INCOME TAXES\n",
      "asset will not be realized. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed.\n",
      "Our framework for assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires us to consider all available evidence, including:\n",
      "• the nature, frequency, and amount of cumulative financial reporting income and losses in recent years;\n",
      "• the sustainability of recent operating profitability of our subsidiaries;\n",
      "• the predictability of future operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset;\n",
      "• the carryforward periods for the net operating loss, capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards, including the effect of reversing taxable temporary differences; and,\n",
      "• prudent and feasible actions and tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to protect against the loss of the deferred tax asset.\n",
      "As a result of sales in the ordinary course of business to manage the investment portfolio and other transactions during the year ended December 31, 2014, remaining U.S. Life Insurance Companies capital loss carryforwards were realized prior to their expiration. This, together with the changes in market conditions, resulted in a conclusion that deferred tax assets related to unrealized tax losses in the U.S. Life Insurance Companies’ available for sale portfolio will more-likely-than-not be realized. Accordingly, the related deferred tax asset valuation allowance was released.\n",
      "Therefore, for the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized a decrease of $1.8 billion in the capital loss carryforward valuation allowance associated with the U.S. Life Insurance Companies, of which $209 million was allocated to income from continuing operations and $1.6 billion was allocated to other comprehensive income. Included in the $1.8 billion was a decrease in the capital loss carryforward valuation allowance of $314 million related to a portion of the U.S. Life Insurance Companies’ capital loss carryforward previously treated as expired that was restored and utilized in 2014.\n",
      "During the year ended December 31, 2014, we also recognized a $325 million decrease in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance associated with certain state, local and foreign jurisdictions, primarily attributable to a corresponding reduction in state and local deferred tax assets.\n",
      "The following table presents the net deferred tax assets (liabilities) at December 31, 2014 and 2013 on a U.S. GAAP basis:\n",
      "Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance of U.S. Consolidated Income Tax Group\n",
      "At December 31, 2014, and 2013, our U.S. consolidated income tax group had net deferred tax assets after valuation allowance of $18.9 billion and $21.3 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2014, and 2013, our U.S. consolidated income tax group had valuation allowances of $129 million and $1.7 billion, respectively.\n",
      "Item 8 / note 24. INCOME TAXES\n",
      "Deferred Tax Liability - Foreign, State and Local\n",
      "At December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had net deferred tax liabilities of $159 million and $116 million, respectively, related to foreign subsidiaries, state and local tax jurisdictions, and certain domestic subsidiaries that file separate tax returns.\n",
      "At December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had deferred tax asset valuation allowances of $1.6 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, related to foreign subsidiaries, state and local tax jurisdictions, and certain domestic subsidiaries that file separate tax returns. We maintained these valuation allowances following our conclusion that we could not demonstrate that it was more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized. This was primarily due to factors such as cumulative losses in recent years and the inability to demonstrate profits within the specific jurisdictions over the relevant carryforward periods.\n",
      "Tax Examinations and Litigation\n",
      "We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with our eligible U.S. subsidiaries. Several U.S. subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements previously filed separate U.S. federal income tax returns and were not part of our U.S. consolidated income tax group. Income earned by subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. is taxed, and income tax expense is recorded, based on applicable U.S. and foreign law.\n",
      "The statute of limitations for all tax years prior to 2000 has expired for our consolidated federal income tax return. We are currently under examination for the tax years 2000 through 2006.\n",
      "On March 20, 2008, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS for years 1997 to 1999. The Notice asserted that we owe additional taxes and penalties for these years primarily due to the disallowance of foreign tax credits associated with cross-border financing transactions. The transactions that are the subject of the Notice extend beyond the period covered by the Notice, and the IRS is challenging the later periods. It is also possible that the IRS will consider other transactions to be similar to these transactions. We have paid the assessed tax plus interest and penalties for 1997 to 1999. On February 26, 2009, we filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking a refund of approximately $306 million in taxes, interest and penalties paid with respect to its 1997 taxable year. We allege that the IRS improperly disallowed foreign tax credits and that our taxable income should be reduced as a result of the 2005 restatement of our consolidated financial statements.\n",
      "We also filed an administrative refund claim on September 9, 2010 for our 1998 and 1999 tax years.\n",
      "On March 29, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, ruled on a motion for partial summary judgment that we filed on July 30, 2010 related to the disallowance of foreign tax credits associated with cross-border financing transactions. The court denied our motion with leave to renew.\n",
      "On August 1, 2012, we filed a motion for partial summary judgment related to the disallowance of foreign tax credits associated with cross border financing transactions. On March 29, 2013, the U.S District Court for the Southern District of New York denied our motion for partial summary judgment related to the disallowance of foreign tax credits associated with cross border financing transactions. On March 17, 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the Second Circuit) granted our petition for an immediate appeal of the partial summary judgment decision. Accordingly, we are presenting our position to the Second Circuit.\n",
      "We will vigorously defend our position and continue to believe that we have adequate reserves for any liability that could result from the IRS actions.\n",
      "We continue to monitor legal and other developments in this area and evaluate the effect, if any, on our position, including recent decisions adverse to other taxpayers.\n",

      "At December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, our unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, were $4.4 billion, $4.3 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, our unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions that, if recognized, would not affect the effective tax rate because they relate to such factors as the timing, rather than the permissibility, of the deduction were $0.3 billion, $0.1 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively. Accordingly, at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate were $4.1 billion, $4.2 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively.\n",
      "Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in income tax expense. At both December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had accrued liabilities of $1.1 billion for the payment of interest (net of the federal benefit) and penalties. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we accrued expense (benefits) of $21 million, $142 million and $192 million, respectively, for the payment of interest (net of the federal benefit) and penalties.\n",
      "We regularly evaluate adjustments proposed by taxing authorities. At December 31, 2014, such proposed adjustments would not have resulted in a material change to our consolidated financial condition, although it is possible that the effect could be material to our consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period. Although it is reasonably possible that a change in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next 12 months, based on the information currently available, we do not expect any change to be material to our consolidated financial condition.\n",

      "· General Insurance\n",
      "- Ratios: We, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses (which for General Insurance excludes net loss reserve discount), and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. Our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under GAAP, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios.\n",
      "- Accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted: both the accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. Natural and man-made catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on AIG in excess of $10 million each and also include certain man-made events, such as terrorism and civil disorders that exceed the $10 million threshold. We believe that as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of management’s control. We also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results.\n",

The importance of any specific assumption can vary by both line of business and accident year. Because actual experience can differ from key assumptions used in establishing reserves, there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves. This is particularly true for long-tail classes of business.\n",

      "Overview of Loss Reserving Process and Methods\n",
      "Our loss reserves can generally be categorized into two distinct groups. Short-tail reserves consists principally of U.S. Property and Special Risks, Europe Property and Special Risks, U.S. Personal Insurance, and Europe and Japan Personal Insurance. Long-tail reserves include U.S. Workers’ Compensation, U.S. Excess Casualty, U.S. Other Casualty, U.S. Financial Lines, Europe Casualty and Financial Lines, and U.S. Run-off Long Tail Insurance Lines.\n",
      "Short-Tail Reserves\n",
      "For our short-tail coverages, such as property, where the nature of claims is generally high frequency with short reporting periods, with volatility arising from occasional severe events, the process for recording non-catastrophe quarterly loss reserves is geared toward maintaining IBNR based on percentages of net earned premiums for that business, rather than projecting ultimate loss ratios based on reported losses. For example, the IBNR reserve required for the latest accident quarter for a product line such as homeowners might be approximately 20 percent of the quarter’s earned premiums. This level of reserve would generally be recorded regardless of the actual losses reported in the current quarter, thus recognizing severe events as they occur. The percent of premium factor reflects both our expectation of the ultimate loss costs associated with the line of business and the expectation of the percentage of ultimate loss costs that have not yet been reported. The expected ultimate loss costs generally reflect the average loss costs from a period of preceding accident quarters that have been adjusted for changes in rate and loss cost levels, mix of business, known exposure to unreported losses, or other factors affecting the particular line of business. The expected percentage of ultimate loss costs that have not yet been reported would be derived from historical loss emergence patterns. For more mature quarters, specific loss development methods would be used to determine the IBNR. For other product lines where the nature of claims is high frequency but low severity, methods including loss development, frequency/severity or a multiple of average monthly losses may be used to determine IBNR reserves. IBNR for claims arising from catastrophic events or events of unusual severity would be determined in close collaboration with the claims department’s knowledge of known information, using alternative techniques or expected percentages of ultimate loss cost emergence based on historical loss emergence of similar claim types.\n",
      "Long-Tail Reserves\n",
      "Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss adjustment expenses (net losses) for our long-tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the product line and volume of business, as well as estimates of reinsurance recoveries. Experience in the more recent accident years generally provides limited statistical credibility of reported net losses on long-tail casualty lines of business. That is because in the more recent accident years, a relatively low proportion of estimated ultimate net incurred losses are reported or paid. Therefore, IBNR reserves constitute a relatively high proportion of net losses.\n",
      "For our longer-tail lines, we generally make actuarial and other assumptions with respect to the following:\n",
      "· Loss cost trend factors are used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on the projected loss ratios for prior accident years.\n",
      "· Expected loss ratios are used for the latest accident year (i.e., accident year 2018 for the year-end 2018 loss reserve analysis) and, in some cases for accident years prior to the latest accident year. The expected loss ratio generally reflects the projected loss ratio from prior accident years, adjusted for the loss cost trend and the effect of rate changes and other quantifiable factors on the loss ratio. For low-frequency, high-severity lines of business such as excess casualty, expected loss ratios generally are used for at least the three most recent accident years.\n",
      "· Loss development factors are used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate basis. Generally, the actual loss development factors observed from prior accident years would be used as a basis to determine the loss development factors for the subsequent accident years.\n",
      "· Tail factors are development factors used for certain longer tailed lines of business (for example, excess casualty, workers’ compensation and general liability),to project future loss development for periods that extend beyond the available development data. The development of losses to the ultimate loss for a given accident year for these lines may take decades and the projection of ultimate losses for an accident year is very sensitive to the tail factors selected beyond a certain age.\n",

      "We record quarterly changes in loss reserves for each product line of business. The overall change in our loss reserves is based on the sum of the changes for all product lines of business. For most long-tail product lines of business, the quarterly loss reserve changes are based on the estimated current loss ratio for each subset of coverage less any amounts paid. Also, any change in estimated ultimate losses from prior accident years deemed to be necessary based on the results of our latest detailed valuation reviews, large loss analyses, or other analytical techniques, either positive or negative, is reflected in the loss reserve and incurred losses for the current quarter. Differences between actual loss emergence in a given period and our expectations based on prior loss reserve estimates are used to monitor reserve adequacy between detailed valuation reviews and may also influence our judgment with respect to adjusting reserve estimates.\n",
      "Details of the Loss Reserving Process\n",
      "The process of determining the current loss ratio for each product line of business is based on a variety of factors. These include considerations such as: prior accident year and policy year loss ratios; rate changes; and changes in coverage, reinsurance, or mix of business. Other considerations include actual and anticipated changes in external factors such as trends in loss costs, inflation, employment rates or unemployment duration or in the legal and claims environment. The current loss ratio for each product line of business is intended to represent our best estimate after reflecting all of the relevant factors. At the close of each quarter, the assumptions and data underlying the loss ratios are reviewed to determine whether the loss ratios remain appropriate. This process includes a review of the actual loss experience in the quarter, actual rate changes achieved, actual changes in reinsurance, quantifiable changes in coverage or mix of business, and changes in other factors that may affect the loss ratio. When this review suggests that the previously determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate, the loss ratio is changed to reflect the revised estimates.\n",
      "We conduct a comprehensive loss detailed valuation review at least annually for each product line of business in accordance with Actuarial Standards of Practice. These standards provide that the unpaid loss estimate may be presented in a variety of ways, such as a point estimate, a range of estimates, a point estimate based on the expected value of several reasonable estimates, or a probability distribution of the unpaid loss amount. Our actuarial best estimate for each product line of business represents an expected value generally considering a range of reasonably possible outcomes.\n",
      "The reserve analysis for each product line of business is performed by a credentialed actuarial team in collaboration with claims, underwriting, business unit management, risk management and senior management. Our actuaries consider the ongoing applicability of prior data groupings and update numerous assumptions, including the analysis and selection of loss development and loss trend factors. They also determine and select the appropriate actuarial or other methods used to estimate reserve adequacy for each business product line, and may employ multiple methods and assumptions for each product line. These data groupings, accident year weights, method selections and assumptions necessarily change over time as business mix changes, development factors mature and become more credible and loss characteristics evolve. In the course of these detailed valuation reviews an actuarial best estimate of the loss reserve is determined. The sum of these estimates for each product line of business yields an overall actuarial best estimate for that line of business.\n",
      "For certain product lines, we measure sensitivities and determine explicit ranges around the actuarial best estimate using multiple methodologies and varying assumptions. Where we have ranges, we use them to inform our selection of best estimates of loss reserves by major product line of business. Our range of reasonable estimates is not intended to cover all possibilities or extreme values and is based on known data and facts at the time of estimation.\n",
      "We consult with third party environmental litigation and engineering specialists, third party toxic tort claims professionals, third party clinical and public health specialists, third party workers’ compensation claims adjusters and third party actuarial advisors to help inform our judgments, as needed.\n",
      "A critical component of our detailed valuation reviews is an internal peer review of our reserving analyses and conclusions, where actuaries independent of the initial review evaluate the reasonableness of assumptions used, methods selected and weightings given to different methods. In addition, each detailed valuation review is subjected to a review and challenge process by specialists in our Enterprise Risk Management group.\n",

      "Our actuaries determine the appropriate actuarial methods and segmentation. This determination is based on a variety of factors including the nature of the losses associated with the product line of business, such as the frequency or severity of the claims. In addition to determining the actuarial methods, the actuaries determine the appropriate loss reserve groupings of data. This determination is a judgmental, dynamic process and refinements to the groupings are made every year. The changes to groupings may be driven by and may change to reflect observed or emerging patterns within and across product lines, or to differentiate different risk characteristics (for example, size of deductibles and extent of third party claims specialists used by our insureds). As an example of reserve segmentation, we write many unique subsets of professional liability, which cover different products, industry segments, and coverage structures. While for pricing or other purposes, it may be appropriate to evaluate the profitability of each subset individually, we believe it is appropriate to combine the subsets into larger groups for reserving purposes to produce a greater degree of credibility in the loss experience. This determination of data segmentation and related actuarial methods is assessed, reviewed and updated at least annually.\n",
      "The actuarial methods we use most commonly include paid and incurred loss development methods, expected loss ratio methods, including “Bornhuetter Ferguson” and “Cape Cod”, and frequency/severity models. Loss development methods utilize the actual loss development patterns from prior accident years updated through the current year to project the reported losses to an ultimate basis for all accident years. We also use this information to update our current accident year loss selections. Loss development methods are generally most appropriate for classes of business that exhibit a stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next, and for which the components of the product line have similar development characteristics. For example, property exposures would generally not be combined into the same product line as casualty exposures, and primary casualty exposures would generally not be combined into the same product line as excess casualty exposures. We continually refine our loss reserving techniques and adopt further segmentations based on our analysis of differing emerging loss patterns for certain product lines. We generally use expected loss ratio methods in cases where the reported loss data lacked sufficient credibility to utilize loss development methods, such as for new product lines of business or for long-tail product lines at early stages of loss development. Frequency/severity models may be used where sufficient frequency counts are available to apply such approaches.\n",
      "Expected loss ratio methods rely on the application of an expected loss ratio to the earned premium for the product line of business to determine the liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses. For example, an expected loss ratio of 70 percent applied to an earned premium base of $10 million for a product line of business would generate an ultimate loss estimate of $7 million. Subtracting any paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve for this product line. Under the Bornhuetter Ferguson methods, the expected loss ratio is applied only to the expected unreported portion of the losses. For example, for a long-tail product line of business for which only 10 percent of the losses are expected to be reported at the end of the accident year, the expected loss ratio would be used to represent the 90 percent of losses still unreported. The actual reported losses at the end of the accident year would be added to determine the total ultimate loss estimate for the accident year. Subtracting the reported paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve. In the example above, the expected loss ratio of 70 percent would be multiplied by 90 percent. The result of 63 percent would be applied to the earned premium of $10 million resulting in an estimated unreported loss of $6.3 million. Actual reported losses would be added to arrive at the total ultimate losses. If the reported losses were $1 million, the ultimate loss estimate under the Bornhuetter Ferguson method would be $7.3 million versus the $7 million amount under the expected loss ratio method described above. Thus, the Bornhuetter Ferguson method gives partial credibility to the actual loss experience to date for the product line of business. Loss development methods generally give full credibility to the reported loss experience to date. In the example above, loss development methods would typically indicate an ultimate loss estimate of $10 million, as the reported losses of $1 million would be estimated to reflect only 10 percent of the ultimate losses.\n",
      "AIG | 2018 Form 10-K 45\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Critical Accounting Estimates\n",
      "A key advantage of loss development methods is that they respond more quickly to any actual changes in loss costs for the product line of business. Therefore, if loss experience is unexpectedly deteriorating or improving, the loss development method gives full credibility to the changing experience. Expected loss ratio methods would be slower to respond to the change, as they would continue to give more weight to a prior expected loss ratio, until enough evidence emerged to modify the expected loss ratio to reflect the changing loss experience. On the other hand, loss development methods have the disadvantage of overreacting to changes in reported losses if the loss experience is anomalous due to the various key factors described above and the inherent volatility in some of the classes. For example, the presence or absence of large losses at the early stages of loss development could cause the loss development method to overreact to the favorable or unfavorable experience by assuming it is a fundamental shift in the development pattern. In these instances, expected loss ratio methods such as Bornhuetter Ferguson have the advantage of recognizing large losses without extrapolating unusual large loss activity onto the unreported portion of the losses for the accident year.\n",
      "The Cape Cod method is a hybrid between the loss development and Bornhuetter Ferguson methods, where the historic loss data and loss development factor assumptions are used to determine the expected loss ratio estimate in the Bornhuetter Ferguson method.\n",
      "Frequency/severity methods generally rely on the determination of an ultimate number of claims and an average severity for each claim for each accident year. Multiplying the estimated ultimate number of claims for each accident year by the expected average severity of each claim produces the estimated ultimate loss for the accident year. Frequency/severity methods generally require a sufficient volume of claims in order for the average severity to be predictable. Average severity for subsequent accident years is generally determined by applying an estimated annual loss cost trend to the estimated average claim severity from prior accident years. In certain cases, a structural approach may also be used to predict the ultimate loss cost. Frequency/severity methods have the advantage that ultimate claim counts can generally be estimated more quickly and accurately than can ultimate losses. Thus, if the average claim severity can be accurately estimated, these methods can more quickly respond to changes in loss experience than other methods. However, for average severity to be predictable, the product line of business must consist of homogenous types of claims for which loss severity trends from one year to the next are reasonably consistent and where there are limited changes to deductible levels or limits. Generally these methods work best for high frequency, low severity product lines of business such as personal auto. However, frequency and severity metrics are also used to test the reasonability of results for other product lines of business and provide indications of underlying trends in the data. In addition, ultimate claim counts can be used as an alternative exposure measure to earned premiums in the Cape Cod method.\n",
      "Structural driver analytics seek to explain the underlying drivers of frequency/severity. A structural driver analysis of frequency/severity is particularly useful for understanding the key drivers of uncertainty in the ultimate loss cost. For example, for the excess workers’ compensation product line of business, we have attempted to corroborate our judgment by considering the impact on severity of the future potential for deterioration of an injured worker’s medical condition, the impact of price inflation on the various categories of medical expense and cost of living adjustments on indemnity benefits, the impact of injured worker mortality and claim specific settlement and loss mitigation strategies, etc., using the following:\n",
      "• Claim by claim reviews, often facilitated by third party specialists, to determine the stability and likelihood of settling an injured worker’s indemnity and medical benefits;\n",
      "• Analysis of the potential for future deterioration in medical condition unlikely to be picked up by a claim file review and associated with potentially costly medical procedures (i.e., increases in both utilization and intensity of medical care) over the course of the injured worker’s lifetime;\n",
      "• Analysis of the cost of medical price inflation for each category of medical spend (services and devices) and for cost of living adjustments in line with statutory requirements;\n",
      "• Portfolio specific mortality level and mortality improvement assumptions based on a mortality study conducted for our primary and excess workers’ compensation portfolios and our opinion of future longevity trends for the open reported cases;\n",
      "• Ground-up consideration of the reinsurance recoveries expected for the product line of business for reported claims with extrapolation for unreported claims; and\n",

      "In recent years, we have expanded our analysis of structural drivers to additional product lines of business as a means of corroborating our judgments using traditional actuarial techniques. For example, we have explicitly used external estimates of future medical inflation and mortality in estimating the loss development tail for excess of deductible primary workers’ compensation business. Using external forecasts for items such as these can improve the accuracy and stability of our estimates.\n",
      "The estimation of liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental pollution losses on insurance policies written many years ago is typically subject to greater uncertainty than other types of losses. This is due to inconsistent court decisions, as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies or have expanded theories of liability. In addition, reinsurance recoverable balances relating to asbestos and environmental loss reserves are subject to greater uncertainty due to the underlying age of the claim, underlying legal issues surrounding the nature of the coverage, and determination of proper policy period. For these reasons, these balances tend to be subject to increased levels of disputes and legal collection activity when actually billed. The insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures.\n",
      "We continue to receive claims asserting injuries and damages from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged claims to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites, referred to collectively as environmental claims, and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. The vast majority of these asbestos and environmental losses emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained absolute exclusions for pollution-related damage and asbestos. The current environmental policies that we specifically price and underwrite for environmental risks on a claims-made basis have been excluded from the analysis.\n",
      "The majority of our exposures for asbestos and environmental losses are related to excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. The litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity amounts, with litigation expenses included within the limits of the liability we incur. Individual significant loss reserves, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case-by-case basis.\n",

      "We generally use a combination of loss development and expected loss ratio methods for U.S. Workers’ Compensation as this line of business is long-tail.\n",
      "The loss cost trend assumption is not believed to be material with respect to our guaranteed cost loss reserves. This is primarily because our actuaries are generally able to use loss development projections for all but the most recent accident year’s reserves, so there is limited need to rely on loss cost trend assumptions for primary workers’ compensation business.\n",
      "The tail factor is typically the most critical assumption, and small changes in the selected tail factor can have a material effect on our carried reserves. For example, the tail factors beyond twenty years for guaranteed cost business could vary by one and one-half percent below to two percent above those actually indicated in the 2018 loss reserve review. For excess of deductible business, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that tail factors beyond twenty years could vary by four percent below to six percent above those actually indicated in the 2018 loss reserve review.\n",

      "Key Assumptions\n",
      "U.S. Excess Casualty\n",
      "We utilize various loss cost trend assumptions for different segments of the portfolio. After evaluating the historical loss cost trends from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss cost trends applicable to the year-end 2018 loss reserve review for U.S. Excess Casualty may range five percent lower or higher than this estimated loss trend. The loss cost trend assumption is critical for the U.S. Excess Casualty class of business due to the long-tail nature of the losses, and is applied across many accident years. Thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years (the expected loss ratio years) to be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends that were initially relied upon in setting the loss reserves. These changes in loss trends could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.\n",
      "U.S. Excess Casualty is a long-tail class of business and any deviation in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. Mass tort claims in particular may develop over a very extended period and impact multiple accident years, so we usually select a separate pattern for them. Thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years to be significantly affected by changes in loss development factors that were initially relied upon in setting the reserves.\n",
      "After evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the actual loss development factors could vary by an amount equivalent to a six month shift from those actually utilized in the year-end 2018 reserve review. This would impact projections both for accident years where the selections were directly based on loss development methods as well as the a priori loss ratio assumptions for accident years with selections based on Bornhuetter-Ferguson or Cape Cod methods. Similar to loss cost trends, these changes in loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.\n",
      "U.S. Other Casualty\n",
      "The key uncertainties for other casualty lines are similar to excess casualty, as the underlying business is long-tailed and can be subject to variability in loss cost trends and changes in loss development factors. These may differ significantly by line of business as coverages such as general liability, medical malpractice and environmental may be subject to different risk drivers.\n",
      "U.S. Financial Lines\n",
      "The loss cost trends for U.S. D&O business vary by year and subset, but for the most recent accident years, it is assumed to have been generally close to zero. After evaluating the historical loss cost levels from prior accident years since the early 1990s, including the potential effect of losses relating to the credit crisis, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the actual variation in loss cost levels for these subsets could vary by approximately 10 percent lower or higher on a year-over-year basis than the assumptions actually utilized in the year-end 2018 reserve review. Because U.S. D&O business has exhibited highly volatile loss trends from one accident year to the next, there is the possibility of an exceptionally high deviation. In our analysis, the effects of loss cost trend assumptions affect the results through the a priori loss ratio assumptions used for the Bornhuetter-Ferguson and Cape Cod methods, which impact the projections for the more recent accident years.\n",
      "The selected loss development factors are also an important assumption, but are less critical than for U.S. Excess Casualty. Because these classes are written on a claims made basis, the loss reporting and development tail is much shorter than for U.S. Excess Casualty. However, the high severity nature of the losses does create the potential for significant deviations in loss development patterns from one year to the next. Similar to U.S. Excess Casualty, after evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss development factors could change by an amount equivalent to a shift by six months from those actually utilized in the year-end 2018 reserve review.\n",
      "Europe Casualty and Financial Lines\n",

For environmental claims, we have utilized a variety of methods including traditional loss development approaches, claim department and other expert evaluations of the ultimate costs for certain claims and survival ratio metrics.\n",
      "U.S. Run-off Long Tail Insurance lines is an extremely long-tail class of business, with a much greater than normal uncertainty as to the appropriate loss development factors for the tail of the loss development. Specifically for excess workers’ compensation, after evaluating the historical loss development factors for prior accident years since the 1980s as well as the development over the past several years of the ground up loss projections utilized to help select the loss development factors in the tail for this class of business, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the tail factor beyond 30 years could vary by 10 percent above or below that actually indicated in the 2018 loss reserve review.\n",
      "Other Reserve Items\n",
      "Loss adjustment expenses (LAE) are separated into two broad categories, allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE), also referred to as legal defense and cost containment or “legal” and unallocated loss adjustment expenses (ULAE), which includes certain claims adjuster fees and other internal claim management costs.\n",
      "We determine reserves for legal expenses for each class of business by one or more actuarial or structural driver methods. For the majority of segments, legal costs are analyzed in conjunction with losses. For segments where they are separately analyzed the methods used generally include development methods comparable to those described for loss development methods. The development could be based on either the paid loss adjustment expenses or the ratio of paid loss adjustment expenses to paid losses, or both. Other methods include the utilization of expected ultimate ratios of paid loss expense to paid losses, based on actual experience from prior accident years or from similar product lines of business.\n",
      "The bulk of adjuster expenses are allocated and charged to individual claim files. For these expenses, we generally determine reserves based on calendar year ratios of adjuster expenses paid to losses paid for the particular product line of business. For other internal claim costs, which generally relate to specific claim department expenses that are not allocated to individual claim files such as technology costs and other broad initiatives, we look at historic and expected expenditures for these items and project these into the future.\n",
      "The incidence of LAE is directly related to the frequency, complexity and level of underlying claims. As a result, a key driver of variability in LAE is the variability in the overall claims, particularly for long tail lines.\n",
      "The following sensitivity analysis table summarizes the effect on the loss reserve position of using certain alternative loss cost trend (for accident years where we use expected loss ratio methods) or loss development factor assumptions rather than the assumptions actually used in determining our estimates in the year-end loss reserve analyses in 2018:\n",

      "Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health Insurance Contracts\n",
      "Long-duration traditional products include whole life insurance, term life insurance, accident and health insurance, long-term care insurance, and certain payout annuities for which the payment period is life-contingent, which include certain of our single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements.\n",
      "For long-duration traditional business, a “lock-in” principle applies. The assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. The assumptions include mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses, and investment returns. These assumptions are typically consistent with pricing inputs. The assumptions also include margins for adverse deviation, principally for key assumptions such as mortality and interest rates used to discount cash flows, to reflect uncertainty given that actual experience might deviate from these assumptions. Establishing margins at contract inception requires management judgment. The extent of the margin for adverse deviation may vary depending on the uncertainty of the cash flows, which is affected by the volatility of the business and the extent of our experience with the product.\n",
      "Loss recognition occurs if observed changes in actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses under loss recognition testing. To determine whether loss recognition exists, we determine whether a future loss is expected based on updated current assumptions. If loss recognition exists, we recognize the loss by first reducing DAC through amortization expense, and, if DAC is depleted, record additional liabilities through a charge to policyholder benefit expense. Because of the long-term nature of many of our liabilities subject to the “lock-in” principle, small changes in certain assumptions may cause large changes in the degree of reserve adequacy. In particular, changes in estimates of future invested asset returns have a large effect on the degree of reserve deficiency.\n",
      "For additional information on loss recognition see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "Groupings for loss recognition testing are consistent with our manner of acquiring, servicing, and measuring the profitability of the business and are applied by product groupings, including traditional life, payout annuities and long-term care insurance. Once loss recognition has been recorded for a block of business, the old assumption set is replaced and the assumption set used for the loss recognition would then be subject to the lock-in principle. Key judgments made in loss recognition testing include the following:\n",
      "• To determine investment returns used in loss recognition tests, we typically match liabilities with assets of comparable duration, to the extent practicable, and then project future cash flows on those assets. Assets supporting insurance liabilities are primarily comprised of a diversified portfolio of high to medium quality fixed maturity securities, and may also include, to a lesser extent, alternative investments. Our projections include a reasonable allowance for investment expenses and expected credit losses over the projection horizon. A critical assumption in the projection of expected investment income is the assumed net rate of investment return at which excess cash flows are to be reinvested. For products in which asset and liability durations are matched relatively well, this is less of a consideration since interest on excess cash flows are not a significant component of future cash flows. For the reinvestment rate assumption, anticipated future changes to the yield curves could have a large effect. Given the interest rate environment applicable at the date of our most recent loss recognition tests, we assumed a modest and gradual increase in long-term interest rates over time.\n",
      "• For mortality assumptions, key judgments include the extent of industry versus own experience to base future assumptions as well as the extent of expected mortality improvements in the future. The latter judgment is based on a combination of historical mortality trends and advice from industry, public health and demography specialists that were consulted by AIG’s actuaries and published industry information.\n",
      "• For surrender rates, a key judgment involves the correlation between expected increases/decreases in interest rates and increases/decreases in surrender rates. To support this judgment, we compare crediting rates on our products to expected rates on competing products under different interest rate scenarios.\n",
      "• For in-force long-term care insurance, rate increases are allowed but must be approved by state insurance regulators. Consequently, the extent of rate increases that may be assumed requires judgment. In establishing our assumption for rate increases for long-term care insurance, we consider historical experience as to the frequency and level of rate increases approved by state regulators.\n",

In applying shadow loss recognition, the Company overlays unrealized gains onto loss recognition tests without revising the underlying test.

A variable annuity contract may include more than one type of guaranteed benefit feature; for example, it may have both a GMDB and a GMWB. However, a policyholder can generally only receive payout from one guaranteed feature on a contract containing a death benefit and a living benefit, i.e., the features are generally mutually exclusive (except a surviving spouse who has a rider to potentially collect both a GMDB upon their spouse’s death and a GMWB during his or her lifetime). A policyholder cannot purchase more than one living benefit on one contract. Declines in the equity markets, increased volatility and a sustained low interest rate environment increase our exposure to potential benefits under the guaranteed features, leading to an increase in the liabilities for those benefits.\n",

Certain fixed index annuity products offer optional guaranteed benefit features similar to those offered on variable annuity products. The index crediting feature of these products results in the recognition of an embedded derivative that is required to be bifurcated from the host contract and carried at fair value. Option pricing models are used to estimate fair value, taking into account assumptions for future equity index growth rates, volatility of the equity index, future interest rates, and our ability to adjust the participation rate and the cap on equity indexed credited rates in light of market conditions and policyholder behavior assumptions.\n",

      "Policy acquisition costs and policy issuance costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal of existing insurance contracts related to universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) are generally deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the expected lives of the contracts, except in instances where significant negative gross profits are expected in one or more periods. Estimated gross profits include current and expected interest rates, net investment income and spreads, net realized capital gains and losses, fees, surrender rates, mortality experience and equity market returns and volatility. In estimating future gross profits, lapse assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on DAC amortization. For fixed deferred annuity contracts, the future spread between investment income and interest credited to policyholders is a significant judgment, particularly in a low interest rate environment.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Critical Accounting Estimates\n",
      "If the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change, DAC and related reserves, including VOBA, SIA, guaranteed benefit reserves and unearned revenue reserve (URR), are recalculated using the new assumptions, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. Updating such assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.\n",
      "In estimating future gross profits for variable annuity products as of December 31, 2018, a long-term annual asset growth assumption of 7.0 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected) was applied to estimate the future growth in assets and related asset-based fees. In determining the asset growth rate, the effect of short-term fluctuations in the equity markets is partially mitigated through the use of a reversion to the mean methodology, whereby short-term asset growth above or below the long-term annual rate assumption impacts the growth assumption applied to the five-year period subsequent to the current balance sheet date. The reversion to the mean methodology allows us to maintain our long-term growth assumptions, while also giving consideration to the effect of actual investment performance. When actual performance significantly deviates from the annual long-term growth assumption, as evidenced by growth assumptions for the five-year reversion to the mean period falling below a certain rate (floor) or above a certain rate (cap) for a sustained period, judgment may be applied to revise or “unlock” the growth rate assumptions to be used for both the five-year reversion to the mean period as well as the long-term annual growth assumption applied to subsequent periods. The use of a reversion to the mean assumption is common within the industry; however, the parameters used in the methodology are subject to judgment and vary within the industry.\n",

We record adjustments to reflect the results of these assessments through an allowance for uncollectable reinsurance that reduces the carrying amount of reinsurance assets on the balance sheet. This estimate requires significant judgment for which key considerations include:\n",

Determining a reasonable estimate of the amount of such losses requires significant management judgment. In many cases, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases that are in the early stages of litigation or in which claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, we often cannot predict the outcome or estimate the eventual loss or range of reasonably possible losses related to such matters. Given the inherent unpredictability of such matters, the outcome of certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n",

We subject the forecasts to stresses of key assumptions and evaluate the effect on tax attribute utilization. We also apply stresses to our assumptions about the effectiveness of relevant prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In 2018, we have also considered the impact of the Tax Act on our forecasts of taxable income, made certain assumptions related to interpretation of relevant new rules, and incorporated guidance issued by the U.S. tax authority. Our analysis also reflected the effect of slower utilization of our tax credits due to a reduction in the U.S. statutory tax rate as a result of the Tax Act. Our income forecasts, coupled with our tax planning strategies, all resulted in sufficient taxable income to achieve realization of the U.S. tax attributes prior to their expiration.\n",

As of December 31, 2018, we continue to be in an overall unrealized tax gain position with respect to the U.S. Non-Life Companies’ available for sale securities portfolio and thus concluded no valuation allowance is necessary in the U.S. Non-Life Companies’ available for sale securities portfolio.\n",

      "AIG’s Outlook - Industry and economic factors\n",
      "Our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit and equity market conditions, catastrophic claims events, regulation, tax policy, competition, and general economic, market and political conditions. We continued to operate under difficult market conditions in 2018, characterized by factors such as the impact of historically low interest rates, uncertainties in the annuity marketplace resulting from legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at re-evaluating the standard of care for sales of investment products and services, historically high levels of catastrophic events, slowing growth in China and Euro-Zone economies, global trade tensions and the UK’s pending withdrawal from its membership in the European Union (the EU) (commonly referred to as Brexit). Brexit has also affected the U.S. dollar/British pound exchange rate and increased the volatility of exchange rates among the euro, British pound and the Japanese yen (the Major Currencies), which may continue for some time.\n",
      "Impact of Changes in the Interest Rate Environment\n",
      "While interest rates remain low by historical standards, interest rates during 2018, particularly in the United States, have risen, in some cases close to highs of the last five to ten years. In early 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve System indicated that it expects the pace of rate increases to slow. The low interest rate environment negatively affects sales of interest rate sensitive products in our industry and may negatively impact the profitability of our existing business as we reinvest cash flows from investments, including increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolios. As rates rise, some of these impacts may abate while there may be different impacts, some of which are highlighted below. We actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through portfolio selection and asset-\n",

      "liability management, including spread management strategies for our investment-oriented products and economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable and fixed index annuities.\n",
      "Additionally, sustained low interest rates on discounting of projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans may result in higher pension expense.\n",
      "Annuity Sales and Surrenders\n",
      "The sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry. Low long-term interest rates put pressure on investment returns, which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products. However, our disciplined rate setting has helped to mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. Rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased sales, but may also drive higher surrenders. Customers are, however, currently buying fixed annuities with surrender charge periods of four to seven years in pursuit of higher returns, which may help mitigate increased early surrenders in a rising rate environment. In addition, older contracts that have higher minimum interest rates and continue to be attractive to the contract holders have driven better than expected persistency in Fixed Annuities, although the reserves for such contracts have continued to decrease over time in amount and as a percentage of the total annuity portfolio. We will closely monitor surrenders of Fixed Annuities as contracts with lower minimum interest rates come out of the surrender charge period in a more attractive rate environment. Low interest rates have also driven growth in our fixed index annuity products, which provide additional interest crediting, tied to favorable performance in certain equity market indices and the availability of guaranteed living benefits. Changes in interest rates significantly impact the valuation of our liabilities for annuities with guaranteed income features and the value of the related hedging portfolio.\n",
      "Reinvestment and Spread Management\n",
      "We actively monitor fixed income markets, including the level of interest rates, credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve. We also frequently review our interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for new and in-force business. Business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in light of the interest rate environment. A low interest rate environment puts margin pressure on pricing of new business and on existing products, due to the challenge of investing new money or recurring premiums and deposits, and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows, in the low interest rate environment. In addition, there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain in-force business. Specifically, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities.\n",
      "The contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in products may reduce spreads in a sustained low interest rate environment and thus reduce future profitability. Although this interest rate risk is partially mitigated through the asset-liability management process, product design elements and crediting rate strategies, a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability.\n",
      "For additional information on our investment and asset-liability management strategies see Investments.\n",
      "For investment-oriented products in our Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance and Institutional Markets businesses, our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business, modifying or limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads, using asset-liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable, and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. Renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals in accordance with state and federal laws and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. We will continue to adjust crediting rates on in-force business to mitigate the pressure on spreads from declining base yields, but our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by the competitive environment, contractual minimum crediting rates, and provisions that allow rates to be reset only at pre-established intervals. As interest rates rise, we may need to raise crediting rates on in-force business for competitive and other reasons potentially reducing the impact of investing in a higher interest rate environment.\n",
      "Of the aggregate fixed account values of our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement annuity products, 66 percent were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at December 31, 2018. The percentage of fixed account values of our annuity products that are currently crediting at rates above one percent was 66 percent and 69 percent at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These businesses continue to focus on pricing discipline and strategies to manage the minimum guaranteed interest crediting rates offered on new sales in the context of regulatory requirements and competitive positioning. In the core universal life business in our Life Insurance business, 65 percent of the account values were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at December 31, 2018.\n",

      "General Insurance\n",
      "The impact of low interest rates on our General Insurance segment is primarily on our long-tail Casualty line of business. We expect limited impacts on our existing long-tail Casualty business as the duration of our assets is slightly longer than that of our liabilities. Sustained low interest rates would potentially impact new and renewal business for the long-tail Casualty line as we may not be able to adjust our future pricing consistent with our profitability objectives to fully offset the impact of investing at lower rates. However, we will continue to maintain pricing discipline and risk selection.\n",
      "In addition, for our General Insurance segment and General Insurance Run-Off Lines reported within the Legacy Portfolio, sustained low interest rates may unfavorably affect the net loss reserve discount for workers’ compensation, and to a lesser extent could favorably impact assumptions about future medical costs, the combined net effect of which could result in higher net loss reserves.\n",

      "Standard of Care Developments\n",
      "The SEC, federal and state lawmakers and state insurance regulators continue their efforts at evaluating what is an appropriate regulatory framework around a standard of care for the sale of investment products and services. For example, on April 18, 2018, the SEC proposed a package of rulemakings and interpretations designed to address the standard of care issues and the transparency of retail investors’ relationships with investment advisors and broker-dealers. Additionally, on July 18, 2018, the New York State Department of Financial Services adopted a best interest standard of care regulation applicable to annuity and life transactions through issuance of the First Amendment to Insurance Regulation 187 - Suitability and Best Interests in Life Insurance and Annuity Transactions (Regulation 187). The compliance date for Regulation 187 is August 1, 2019 for annuity products and February 1, 2020 for life products. As amended, Regulation 187 requires producers to act in their client’s best interest when making point-of-sale and in-force recommendations, and provide in writing the basis for the recommendation, as well as the facts and analysis to support the recommendation. The amended regulation also imposes additional duties on life insurance companies in relation to these transactions, such as requiring insurers to establish and maintain procedures designed to prevent financial exploitation and abuse. We will implement and enhance processes and procedures, where needed, to comply with this regulation. Other states, such as Nevada, Maryland and New Jersey, have also proposed similar standard of care regulations applicable to insurance producers and/or insurance companies. We continue to closely follow these proposals and other relevant federal and state-level regulatory and legislative developments in this area. While we cannot predict the long-term impact of these developments on our Life and Retirement businesses, we believe our diverse product offerings and distribution relationships position us to compete effectively in this evolving marketplace.\n",
      "Impact of Currency Volatility\n",
      "Currency volatility remains acute. Such volatility affected line item components of income for those businesses with substantial international operations. In particular, growth trends in net premiums written reported in U.S. dollars can differ significantly from those measured in original currencies. The net effect on underwriting results, however, is significantly mitigated, as both revenues and expenses are similarly affected.\n",
      "These currencies may continue to fluctuate, in either direction, especially as a result of the UK’s announced exit from the EU, and such fluctuations will affect net premiums written growth trends reported in U.S. dollars, as well as financial statement line item comparability.\n",

Following this announcement, on December 20, 2018 the UK Parliament passed the Civil Liability Act 2018 which implements a new framework for determining the Ogden rate and requires the UK Ministry of Justice to start a review of the Ogden rate within 90 days of its commencement and review periodically thereafter. The Ministry of Justice concluded a public call for evidence on January 30, 2019 prior to beginning its first review.

      "U.S. Tax Reform Overview\n",
      "On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted Public Law 115-97, known informally as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Tax Act reduced the statutory rate of U.S. federal corporate income tax to 21 percent and enacted numerous other changes impacting AIG and the insurance industry. At December 31, 2017, we originally recorded a provisional estimate of income tax effects of the Tax Act of $6.7 billion, including a tax charge of $6.7 billion attributable to the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate and tax benefit of $38 million related to the deemed repatriation tax. Our provisional estimate of $6.7 billion was based in part on a reasonable estimate of the effects of the statutory income tax rate reduction on existing deferred tax balances and of certain provisions of the Tax Act. We filed our 2017 consolidated U.S. income tax return and have completed our review of the primary impact of the Tax Act provisions on our deferred taxes. As a result, we consider the accounting for the effects of the rate change on deferred tax balances to be complete and no material measurement period changes were recorded for this item.\n",
      "Changes specific to the insurance industry include the calculation of insurance tax reserves and related transition adjustments, amortization of specified policy acquisition expenses, treatment of separate account dividends received deductions and computation of pro-ration adjustments. Provisions of the Tax Act with broader application include reductions or elimination of deductions for certain items, e.g., reductions to corporate dividends received deductions, disallowance of entertainment expenses and limitations on the deduction of certain executive compensation costs. These provisions, generally, result in an increase in AIG’s taxable income.\n",
      "The Tax Act includes provisions for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) under which taxes on foreign income are imposed on the excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of certain foreign subsidiaries and for Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) under which taxes are imposed on certain base eroding payments to affiliated foreign companies. There are substantial uncertainties in the interpretation of BEAT and GILTI and while certain formal guidance was issued by the U.S. tax authority, there are still aspects of the Tax Act that remain unclear and additional guidance is either still pending or expected in 2019. Such guidance may result in changes to the interpretations and assumptions we made and actions we may take, which may impact amounts recorded with respect to international provisions of the Tax Act, possibly materially. Consistent with accounting guidance, we treat BEAT as a period tax charge in the period the tax is incurred and have made an accounting policy election to treat GILTI taxes in a similar manner.\n",
      "During the period ended December 31, 2018, we have completed our review of the impact of the Tax Act on our forecasts of taxable income, made certain assumptions related to interpretation of relevant new rules, and incorporated guidance issued by the U.S. tax authority. While the prescribed SAB 118 measurement period has ended, there are still certain aspects of the Tax Act that remain unclear, including the complex interplay of the new tax rules with the rules governing the utilization of our tax attributes, and formal guidance from the U.S. tax authority is still pending. We will continue to review the impact of any additional guidance issued by the U.S. tax authority on our valuation allowance analysis in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2018, we consider the determination of the need for a valuation allowance related to the Tax Act to be complete based on our analysis of existing tax law and relevant tax guidance, and no measurement period adjustment was recorded.\n",
      "Repatriation Assumptions\n",
      "As a result of the Tax Act, the majority of accumulated foreign earnings that were previously untaxed are subject to a one-time deemed repatriation tax. Going forward, foreign earnings not taxed as part of the one-time deemed repatriation (or otherwise taxed currently under the GILTI or subpart F regimes) will generally be exempt from U.S. tax upon repatriation. Notwithstanding the changes, U.S. tax on foreign exchange gain or loss and certain non-U.S. withholding taxes will continue to be applicable upon future repatriations of foreign earnings. For 2018, we consider our foreign earnings with respect to certain operations in Canada, South Africa, the Far East, Latin America, Bermuda as well as the European, Asia Pacific and Middle East regions to be indefinitely reinvested. These earnings relate to ongoing operations and have been reinvested in active business operations. While, following the enactment of the Tax Act, distributions from foreign affiliates are, generally, not subject to U.S. income tax, such distributions may be subject to local withholding taxes. A deferred tax liability of approximately $100 million to $150 million related to such withholding taxes has not been recorded for those foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Deferred taxes, if necessary, have been provided on earnings of non-U.S. affiliates whose earnings are not indefinitely reinvested.\n",
      "Deemed Repatriation Tax & Impact on Liquidity\n",
      "The Tax Act requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax, net of tax credits, related to applicable foreign taxes paid, on previously untaxed current and accumulated earnings and profits of certain of our foreign subsidiaries.

      "COMPETITION and challenges\n",
      "Operating in a highly competitive industry, General Insurance competes against several hundred companies, specialty insurance organizations, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations in the U.S. In international markets, we compete for business with the foreign insurance operations of large global insurance groups and local companies in specific market areas and product types. Insurance companies compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product pricing, service and terms and conditions. General Insurance seeks to distinguish itself in the insurance industry primarily based on its well-established brand, global franchise, multinational capabilities, financial and capital strength, innovative products, claims expertise to handle complex claims, expertise in providing specialized coverages and customer service.\n",
      "We serve our business and individual customers on a global basis - from the largest multinational corporations to local businesses and individuals. Our clients benefit from our substantial underwriting expertise.\n",
      "Our challenges include:\n",
      "• long-tail Commercial Lines exposures that create added challenges to pricing and risk management;\n",
      "• over capacity in certain lines of business that creates downward market pressure on pricing;\n",
      "• tort environment volatility in certain jurisdictions and lines of business; and\n",
      "• volatility in claims arising from natural and man-made catastrophes.\n",
      "OUTLOOK-INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC FACTORS\n",
      "Below is a discussion of the industry and economic factors impacting our operating segments:\n",
      "General Insurance - North America\n",
      "Commercial Lines over recent years has experienced challenging market conditions, with widespread surplus capacity increasing competition and suppressing rates across multiple classes of business. However, we are seeing growing market support for rate increases in certain U.S. liability segments (outside of workers’ compensation), with increasing traction in excess casualty, D&O and commercial auto, where rates are supported by a trend of higher loss cost inflation. On the shorter tailed lines, the market is supporting higher rates for accounts which suffered losses from major catastrophe events in 2017 and 2018. We continue to achieve positive rate increases across a number of lines and classes of business as a result of our disciplined underwriting strategy and focus on risk selection. Further, we continue to achieve growth in several of our Commercial Lines high margin businesses, although these market segments remain highly competitive.\n",
      "Personal Insurance growth prospects are supported by the need for full life cycle products and coverage, increases in personal wealth accumulation, and awareness of insurance protection and risk management. We compete in the high net worth market, accident and health insurance, travel insurance, and warranty services and will continue to expand our innovative products and services to distribution partners and clients.\n",
      "General Insurance - International\n",
      "We believe our global presence provides Commercial Lines and Personal Insurance a distinct competitive advantage, as the demand for multinational cross-border coverage and services increases due to the growing number of international customers, while giving us the ability to respond quickly to local market conditions and build client relationships.\n",
      "The Commercial Lines market continues to be highly competitive, due to increased market capacity and ample availability of capital. Despite this, we continue to grow our most profitable segments and diversify our portfolio across all regions by expanding into new product lines (e.g. cyber), new client segments (e.g. middle market) and new distribution channels (e.g. digital and national brokers) while remaining a market leader in key developed and developing markets. We are maintaining our underwriting discipline and continuing our risk selection strategy to improve profitability.\n",
      "Personal Insurance focuses on individual customers, as well as group and corporate clients. Although market competition within Personal Insurance has increased, we continue to benefit from the underwriting quality, portfolio diversity, and low volatility of the short-tailed risk in these business lines.\n",

The strong demand for individual variable and fixed index annuities with guaranteed income features has attracted increased competition in this product space. In response to the continued low interest rate environment, which has added pressure to profit margins, we have developed guaranteed income benefits for both variable and fixed index annuities with margins that are less sensitive to the level of interest rates.\n",

VALIC is a leading retirement plan provider in the U.S. for K-12 schools and school districts, higher education, healthcare, government and other not-for-profit institutions. The defined contribution market is a highly efficient and competitive market that requires support for both plan sponsors and individual participants.

      "Consumers have a significant need for life insurance, whether it is used for income replacement for their surviving family, estate planning or wealth transfer. Additionally, consumers use life insurance to provide living benefits in case of chronic, critical or terminal illnesses, and to supplement retirement income.\n",
      "In response to consumer needs and a sustained low interest rate environment, our Life Insurance product portfolio will continue to promote products with lower long-duration interest rate risk and mitigate exposure to products that have long-duration interest rate risk through sales levels and hedging strategies.\n",
      "As life insurance ownership remains at historical lows in the U.S. and the U.K., efforts to expand the reach and increase the affordability of life insurance are critical. The industry is investing in consumer-centric efforts to reduce traditional barriers to securing life protection by simplifying the sales and service experience. Digitally enabled processes and tools provide a fast, friendly and simple path to life insurance protection.\n",

      "SALE OF NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST IN FORTITUDE\n",
      "Fortitude Re was established during the first quarter of 2018 in connection with a series of affiliated reinsurance transactions related to our Legacy Portfolio. Those reinsurance transactions were designed to consolidate most of our Legacy Insurance Run-Off Lines into a single legal entity. As of December 31, 2018, the affiliated transactions included the cession of approximately $31 billion of reserves from our Legacy Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines and approximately $4 billion of reserves from our Legacy General Insurance Run-Off Lines related to business written by multiple wholly-owned AIG subsidiaries. In the second quarter of 2018, we formed Fortitude Holdings, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AIG, to act as a holding company for Fortitude Re.\n",
      "On November 13, 2018, we completed the sale of a 19.9 percent ownership interest in Fortitude Holdings to TCG, an affiliate of The Carlyle Group L.P. (Carlyle) (the Fortitude Re Closing). Fortitude Holdings owns 100 percent of the outstanding common shares of Fortitude Re and AIG has an 80.1 percent ownership interest in Fortitude Holdings.\n",
      "Subject to certain adjustments specified in the Purchase Agreement, we will receive total consideration of approximately $476 million, which is based on Fortitude Re’s total shareholder’s equity of $2.9 billion as of March 31, 2018 excluding planned distributions that the parties will seek to cause to be paid to us on a non-pro rata basis prior to the end of the 18th month following the Fortitude Re Closing, subject to regulatory approvals (the Target Distribution). $381 million of the purchase price was paid at the Fortitude Re Closing and up to $95 million will be paid following December 31, 2023 (the Deferred Payment), subject to the purchase price adjustment described below. To the extent we do not receive all or a portion of the Target Distribution within 18 months of the Fortitude Re Closing, TCG will pay us up to an additional $100 million.\n",
      "As part of the establishment of Fortitude Re, we implemented a capital maintenance agreement (CMA) with Fortitude Re that remains in effect so long as we own at least 50 percent of Fortitude Re. If there are any CMA funding obligations that occur within 18 months of the Fortitude Re Closing, we will fund those obligations on a non-dilutive basis to TCG, but only if, and to the extent, we actually receive the Target Distribution prior to the expiration of such period.\n",

This loss would be incremental to any gain or loss recognized on the sale of our controlling interest in Fortitude Holdings.\n",
      "We have also agreed to a post-closing purchase price adjustment wherein we will reimburse TCG for certain changes in property casualty related reserves, based on an agreed methodology, that occurs on or prior to December 31, 2023, up to the value of TCG’s investment in Fortitude Holdings. Any amount due to TCG in respect of this will be offset by the amount of the Deferred Payment otherwise due from TCG to us.\n",

We also will be required to pay a proportionate amount of an agreed make-whole fee to the extent we fail to satisfy such investment commitment targets.\n",

      "Our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the respective operating segments and AIG Parent. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products. The majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of fixed maturity securities.\n",
      "Investment Highlights in 2018\n",
      "· A rise in interest rates and widening credit spreads, as well as the adoption of the Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Standard (Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement Standard) on January 1, 2018, which resulted in the reclassification of unrealized gains in our equity securities to retained earnings, and in a net unrealized loss in our investment portfolio. Net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio decreased to approximately $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2018 from approximately $13.9 billion as of December 31, 2017.\n",
      "· We continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities and increased lending activities in mortgage loans with favorable risk compared to return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income.\n",
      "· Lower investment returns in our hedge fund portfolio and a decline in income from fixed maturity securities for which the fair value option was elected when compared to 2017 where returns were higher as a result of significant spread tightening that occurred, as well as negative performance of our fair value option equity securities portfolio.\n",
      "· During 2018, we reduced our hedge fund portfolio by approximately $1.8 billion as a result of redemptions consistent with our planned reduction of exposure.\n",
      "· Blended investment yields on new investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called.\n",
      "· In the first quarter of 2018, we sold our remaining interest in Arch, which we received as part of the consideration for selling United Guaranty to Arch in 2016.\n",
      "· Our acquisition of Validus closed in the third quarter of 2018 and our acquisition of Glatfelter closed during the fourth quarter of 2018, increasing our investment portfolio by approximately $6.6 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively.\n",

      "Investment Strategies\n",
      "Investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local and general market conditions, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification.\n",
      "Some of our key investment strategies are as follows:\n",
      "• Fixed maturity securities held by the U.S. insurance companies included in General Insurance consist of a mix of instruments that meet our current risk-return, tax, liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectives.\n",
      "• Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by General Insurance companies consist primarily of high-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.\n",
      "• Our fundamental strategy across all of our investment portfolios is to optimize the duration characteristics of the assets within a target range based on comparable liability characteristics, to the extent practicable.\n",
      "• AIG Parent, included in Other Operations, actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities. Based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchases publicly traded, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity.\n",

      "Attribution of Net Investment Income to Operating Segments\n",
      "Net investment income is attributed to our businesses based on internal models consistent with the nature of the underlying businesses.\n",
      "For General Insurance - North America and International and Legacy General Insurance Run-Off Lines, we estimate investable funds based primarily on loss reserves and unearned premiums. The allocation of net investment income of the General Insurance companies to segments is calculated based on these estimated investable funds, consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities and the required economic capital allocation for each segment\n",
      "For Life and Retirement - Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance, and Institutional Markets and Legacy Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines, net investment income is attributed based on invested assets from segregated product line portfolios held in our Life and Retirement companies. All invested assets of the Life and Retirement companies in excess of liabilities are allocated based on estimates of required economic capital allocation for each segment.\n",
      "Asset Liability Measurement\n",
      "For the General Insurance companies, the duration of liabilities for long-tail casualty lines is greater than that of other lines. As a result, the investment strategy within the General Insurance companies focuses on growth of surplus and preservation of capital, subject to liability and other business considerations.\n",
      "The General Insurance companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies and also invest in structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans. While invested assets backing reserves of the General Insurance companies are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities, we have continued to allocate a portion of our investment activity into asset classes that offer higher yields, particularly in the domestic operations. In addition, we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset-backed investments for their risk-return attributes, as well as to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates. This asset diversification has maintained stable average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity securities were largely unchanged. We expect to continue to pursue this investment strategy to meet the General Insurance companies’ liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives.\n",
      "In addition, a portion of the surplus of General Insurance is invested in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments which seeks to balance liquidity, volatility and growth. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio.\n",
      "Fixed maturity securities of the General Insurance companies’ domestic operations, with an average duration of 3.8 years, are currently comprised of corporate bonds, structured securities, taxable municipal bonds and government and agency bonds as well as tax-exempt securities, which provide attractive risk-adjusted after-tax returns. The majority of these high quality investments are rated A or higher based on composite ratings.\n",
      "Fixed maturity securities held in the General Insurance companies’ foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated A or higher based on composite ratings, with an average duration of 3.3 years.\n",
      "The investment strategy of the Life and Retirement companies is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value, subject to liquidity requirements, capital constraints, diversification requirements, asset-liability management and available investment opportunities.\n",
      "The Life and Retirement companies use asset-liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses. The Life and Retirement companies' fundamental investment strategy is to maintain a diversified, high to medium quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities that, to the extent practicable, complements the characteristics of liabilities, including duration, which is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities, and as a result, certain portfolios are shorter in duration and others are longer in duration. An extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses, which may require us to further extend the duration of the investment portfolio.\n",
      "The Life and Retirement companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans.\n",
      "In addition, the Life and Retirement companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved\n",
      "AIG | 2018 Form 10-K 107\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Investments\n",
      "yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields. While a diversified portfolio of alternative investments remains a fundamental component of the investment strategy of the Life and Retirement companies, we have reduced the overall size of the hedge fund portfolio, in light of changing market conditions and perceived market opportunities, and to continue reducing the size of the private equity portfolio.\n",
      "Fixed maturity securities of the Life and Retirement companies domestic operations, with an average duration of 7.0 years, are comprised primarily of taxable corporate bonds, as well as taxable municipal and government bonds, and agency and non-agency structured securities. The majority of these investments are held in the available for sale portfolio and are rated investment grade based on its composite ratings.\n",
      "Fixed maturity securities held in the Life and Retirement companies foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated A or higher based on composite ratings, with an average duration of 17.0 years.\n",
      "NAIC Designations of Fixed Maturity Securities\n",
      "The Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the National Association of Insurance Companies (NAIC) evaluates the investments of U.S. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called ‘NAIC Designations.’ In general, NAIC Designations of ‘1’ highest quality, or ‘2’ high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while NAIC Designations of ‘3’ through ‘6’ generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade. The NAIC has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities, including non-agency RMBS and CMBS, which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses to better determine the appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities. These methodologies result in an improved NAIC Designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. The following tables summarize the ratings distribution of U.S. Insurance Companies fixed maturity security portfolio by NAIC Designation, and the distribution by composite AIG credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies.\n",
      "For a full description of the composite AIG credit ratings see Credit Ratings.\n",
      "The following table presents the fixed maturity security portfolio categorized by NAIC Designation, at fair value:\n",

      "Credit Ratings\n",
      "At December 31, 2018, approximately 88 percent of our fixed maturity securities were held by our domestic entities. Approximately 17 percent of these securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies, and approximately 15 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated. Our investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services’ ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis.\n",

      "Moody’s Investors Service Inc. (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&P Global Inc.

Rating services are not available for some foreign-issued securities. Our Credit Risk Management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio’s non-rated fixed maturity securities. At December 31, 2018, approximately 24 percent of such investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of our internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated AAA, and approximately 7 percent were below investment grade or not rated.

      "• Higher than expected losses emerging across several casualty product lines, especially in recent accident years (generally, 2011 to 2015) driven by increased frequency and severity of claims. This recent accident year loss emergence caused us to increase loss development factors applied across many accident years.\n",

Under this agreement, we ceded to NICO 80 percent of the losses on subject business paid on or after January 1, 2016 in excess of $25 billion of net paid losses, up to an aggregate limit of $25 billion. We account for this transaction as retroactive reinsurance. This transaction resulted in a gain, which under U.S. GAAP retroactive reinsurance accounting is deferred and amortized into income over the settlement period. NICO created a collateral trust account as security for their claim payment obligations to us, into which they deposited the consideration paid under the agreement, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has provided a parental guarantee to secure NICO’s obligations under the agreement.\n",

      "Investment-oriented products\n",
      "The Life Insurance Companies review and update estimated gross profit projections used to amortize DAC and related items (which may include VOBA, SIA, guaranteed benefit reserves and unearned revenue reserves) for investment-oriented products. Estimated gross profit projections include assumptions for investment-related returns and spreads, product-related fees and expenses, mortality gains and losses, policyholder behavior and other factors. In estimating future gross profits, lapse assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on DAC amortization. If the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC and related reserves are recalculated using the new projections, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. Updating such projections may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.\n",
      "The Life Insurance Companies also review assumptions related to their respective GMWB living benefits that are accounted for as embedded derivatives and measured at fair value. The fair value of these embedded derivatives is based on actuarial assumptions, including policyholder behavior, as well as capital market assumptions.\n",
      "Various assumptions were updated, including the following effective September 30, 2018:\n",
      "• we decreased our reversion to the mean rates (gross of fees) to 2.92 percent from 3.74 percent for the Variable Annuity product line in Individual Retirement and to 1.90 percent from 3.78 percent for the Variable Annuity product line in Group Retirement. Our separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption related to equity market performance remained unchanged at 7.0 percent; and\n",
      "• we lowered our ultimate projected yields on invested assets by approximately three to six basis points on most annuity deposits and by approximately 12 to 19 basis points on most life insurance deposits. Projected yields are graded from a weighted average net GAAP book yield of existing assets supporting the business based on the value of the assets to a weighted average yield based on the duration of the assets excluding assets that mature during the grading period. The grading period is three years for annuity products and five years for life insurance products.\n",

      "Traditional long-duration products\n",
      "For traditional long-duration products, which include whole life insurance, term life insurance, accident and health insurance, long-term care insurance, and life-contingent single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements, a “lock-in” principle applies. The assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. Loss recognition occurs if observed changes in actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses under loss recognition testing. Underlying assumptions are reviewed periodically and updated as appropriate.\n",

      "In Fixed Annuities, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net favorable adjustment of $40 million and $130 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, which reflected lower lapse assumptions, partially offset by lower spread assumptions. In 2016, a net favorable adjustment of $330 million reflected lower lapse assumptions, primarily due to lower long-term interest rates, as well as updates to spread assumptions.\n",
      "In Variable and Index Annuities, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net unfavorable adjustment of $92 million in 2018, primarily due to refinements to the GMWB partial withdrawal assumptions in Variable Annuities and the multi-year index strategy crediting parameters in Index Annuities. The unfavorable adjustments were partially offset by lower GMWB lapse assumptions in Variable Annuities. In 2017, a net favorable adjustment of $112 million was primarily due to an increase in the reversion to the mean rate used for projecting future estimated gross profit for variable annuity products and changes in volatility assumptions. The net favorable adjustment was partially offset by a decrease in the separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption from 7.5 percent to 7.0 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected) and an unfavorable adjustment in connection with the conversion to a new modeling platform for Index Annuities. In 2016, a net favorable adjustment of $39 million was primarily due to favorable updates to assumptions for volatility, lapses, mortality and policy expenses, partially offset by a decrease in the separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption from 8.5 percent to 7.5 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected). The net favorable adjustment included a net unfavorable adjustment of approximately $24 million in connection with the conversion to a new modeling platform for variable annuities, primarily due to refinements to assumptions for guaranteed minimum interest rates and investment fees, partially offset by the impact of other refinements identified during the conversion.\n",

      "In Group Retirement, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a favorable adjustment of $17 million in 2018, primarily due to improved premium persistency assumptions. In 2017, a net favorable adjustment of $13 million was primarily due to an increase in the reversion to the mean rate used for projecting future estimated gross profit for variable annuity products and changes in maintenance expense assumptions. The net favorable adjustment was partially offset by a decrease in the separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption from 7.5 percent to 7.0 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected) and decreases in fixed annuity spread and separate account fee assumptions. In 2016, a net unfavorable adjustment of $47 million was primarily due to refinements in lapse and partial withdrawal assumptions and a decrease in the separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption from 8.5 percent to 7.5 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected).\n",
      "Life Insurance\n",

In 2017, a net unfavorable adjustment of $14 million was primarily due to $13 million of loss recognition expense on long-term care business in the Legacy Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines resulting from model enhancements. In 2016, Legacy Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines recorded $622 million of loss recognition expense on payout annuities.

      "Differences in Valuation of Embedded Derivatives and Economic Hedge Target\n",
      "The variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents an estimate of the underlying economic risks in our GMWB riders. The economic hedge target differs from the U.S. GAAP valuation of the GMWB embedded derivatives primarily due to the following:\n",
      "• The economic hedge target includes 100 percent of rider fees in present value calculations; the U.S. GAAP valuation reflects only those fees attributed to the embedded derivative such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero;\n",
      "• The economic hedge target uses best estimate actuarial assumptions and excludes explicit risk margins used for U.S. GAAP valuation, such as margins for policyholder behavior, mortality, and volatility; and\n",
      "• The economic hedge target excludes the non-performance or “own credit” risk adjustment used in the U.S. GAAP valuation, which reflects a market participant’s view of our claims-paying ability by incorporating an additional spread (the NPA spread) to the swap curve used to discount projected benefit cash flows. Because the discount rate includes the NPA spread and other explicit risk margins, the U.S. GAAP valuation is generally less sensitive to movements in interest rates and other market factors, and to changes from actuarial assumption updates, than the economic hedge target. For more information on our valuation methodology for embedded derivatives within policyholder contract deposits see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "The market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting. In addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program, the Life and Retirement companies have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees. The primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include:\n",
      "• Basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns, which may be either positive or negative;\n",
      "• Realized volatility versus implied volatility;\n",
      "• Actual versus expected changes in the hedge target driven by assumptions not subject to hedging, particularly policyholder behavior; and\n",
      "• Risk exposures that we have elected not to explicitly or fully hedge.\n",

      "Impact on Pre-tax Income (Loss)\n",
      "The impact on our pre-tax income (loss) of the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits and related hedging results includes changes in the fair value of the GMWB embedded derivatives, and changes in the fair value of related derivative hedging instruments, both of which are recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses). Realized capital gains (losses), as well as net investment income from changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities used in the hedging program, are excluded from adjusted pre-tax income of Individual Retirement and Group Retirement.\n",
      "The change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and the change in the value of the hedging portfolio are not expected to be fully offsetting, primarily due to the differences in valuation between the economic hedge target, the U.S. GAAP embedded derivatives and the fair value of the hedging portfolio, as discussed above. When corporate credit spreads widen, the change in the NPA spread generally reduces the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a gain, and when corporate credit spreads narrow or tighten, the change in the NPA spread generally increases the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a loss. In addition to changes driven by credit market-related movements in the NPA spread, the NPA balance also reflects changes in business activity and in the net amount at risk from the underlying guaranteed living benefits.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Insurance Reserves\n",
      "The net impact on pre-tax income from the GMWB embedded derivatives and related hedges in 2018 (excluding related DAC amortization) was primarily driven by gains from the impact of widening credit spreads on the NPA spread, and higher interest rates, partially offset by losses from the impact of the change in credit spreads and the move from an economic to a GAAP discount basis. In 2017, the net impact on pre-tax income was primarily driven by losses from actuarial assumption updates to lapse and volatility assumptions, tightening credit spreads on the NPA spread and the impact on the NPA volume of lower expected GMWB payments, driven by higher equity markets. In 2016, the net impact on pre-tax income was primarily driven by the impact of rising interest rates and equity markets late in the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in fair value losses in the hedging portfolio, which were not offset by decreases in the embedded derivative liabilities as the risk margins and other assumptions used in the U.S. GAAP valuation caused the embedded derivatives to be less sensitive to market changes than the related hedge portfolio. In addition, 2016 included losses from actuarial assumption updates due to lapse and mortality assumptions.\n",
      "The change in the fair value of the GMWB embedded derivatives, excluding NPA and update of actuarial assumptions, in 2018 reflected losses from lower equity markets and the impact of moving from an economic to a GAAP discount basis, offset by increases in interest rates and widening credit spreads. In 2018, the hedge losses were driven by losses from higher interest rates and widening credit spreads, offset by gains from lower equity markets. In 2017, the change in the fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding update of actuarial assumptions and NPA, was largely offset by the related hedging portfolio. However, in 2016, the change in fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding update of actuarial assumptions and NPA, reflected losses on the hedging portfolio driven by improvements in both interest rates and equity markets late in the fourth quarter of 2016, which were not offset by decreases in embedded derivative liabilities.\n",
      "Fair value gains or losses in the hedging portfolio are typically not fully offset by increases or decreases in liabilities on a U.S. GAAP basis, due to the NPA and other risk margins used for U.S. GAAP valuation that cause the embedded derivatives to be less sensitive to changes in market rates than the hedge portfolio. On an economic basis, the changes in the fair value of the hedge portfolio were partially offset by the decrease in the economic hedge target, as discussed below.\n",
      "Change in Economic Hedge Target\n",
      "The decrease in the economic hedge target liability in 2018 was primarily due to higher interest rates and widening of credit spreads, offset by lower equity markets.

      "Change in Fair Value of the Hedging Portfolio\n",
      "The changes in the fair value of the economic hedge target and, to a lesser extent, the embedded derivative valuation under U.S. GAAP, were offset in part by the following changes in the fair value of the variable annuity hedging portfolio:\n",
      "• Changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities, primarily corporate bonds for which the fair value option has been elected, are used as a capital-efficient way to economically hedge interest rate and credit spread-related risk. The change in the fair value of the corporate bond hedging program in 2018 reflected losses due to increases in interest rates, and widening of credit spreads. The net gains in 2017 were primarily due to tightening of credit spreads. The net gains in 2016 reflected the impact of credit spreads tightening and decreases in market interest rates in the first nine months of 2016, partially offset by an increase in rates in the fourth quarter of 2016. The change in the fair value of the hedging bonds, which is excluded from the adjusted pre-tax income of the Individual Retirement and Group Retirement segments, is reported in net investment income on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).\n",
      "• Changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative contracts, which included swaps, swaptions and futures, resulted in net losses driven by higher interest rates in 2018. The small net loss in 2017 reflected increases in rates in the latter half of 2017, partially offset by the impact of interest rate declines in the first half of 2017. The net losses in 2016 reflected increases in rates in the fourth quarter of 2016, which more than offset the impact of interest rate declines in the first nine months of 2016.\n",
      "• The change in the fair value of equity derivative contracts, which included futures and options, resulted in gains in 2018, and losses in 2017 and 2016, which varied based on the relative change in equity market returns in the respective periods.\n",

      "The net adjustments to DAC amortization from the update of actuarial assumptions for estimated gross profits, including those reported within change in DAC related to net realized capital gains (losses), represented four percent, two percent and four percent of the DAC balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n",
      "Reversion to the Mean\n",
      "The reversion to the mean rate is updated quarterly based on market returns and can change dramatically in periods where market returns move significantly. The five-year reversion to the mean period did not meet the criteria for adjustment in 2018 which would have otherwise required a reset of the start date used in the calculation of the average gross long-term return rate. The long-term growth assumption used in our reversion to the mean methodology remained unchanged at 7.0 percent in 2018.\n",
      "In 2017, we updated the long-term annual growth assumption applied to subsequent periods used in our reversion to the mean methodology for estimating future estimated gross profits for variable annuity products, from 7.5 percent to 7.0 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected). The five-year reversion to the mean period has met the criteria for adjustment in 2017. As a result, the average gross long-term return measurement start date was reset to December 31, 2011 for Individual Retirement and June 30, 2013 for Group Retirement; the reversion to the mean rates (gross of fees) were increased to 3.74 percent in Individual Retirement and 3.78 percent in Group Retirement. Sustained favorable equity market performance in excess of long-term assumptions could result in additional unlocking in the Individual Retirement or Group Retirement variable annuity product lines in the future, with a positive effect on pre-tax income in the period of the unlocking.\n",
      "In 2016, the long-term annual asset growth assumption was updated from 8.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The five-year reversion to the mean period did not meet the criteria for adjustment in 2016.\n",

Similarly, for long-duration traditional products, significant unrealized appreciation of investments in a sustained low interest rate environment may cause additional future policy benefit liabilities (shadow Loss Adjustments) with an offset to OCI to be recorded.\n",
      "Shadow adjustments to DAC and unearned revenue generally move in the opposite direction of the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, reducing the reported DAC and unearned revenue balance when market interest rates decline. Conversely, shadow adjustments to benefit reserves generally move in the same direction as the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, increasing reported future policy benefit liabilities balance when market interest rates decline.\n",

At December 31, 2018, the shadow Investment-Oriented Adjustments reflected increases in DAC and unearned revenues and a decrease in future policy benefit liabilities compared to December 31, 2017, while the shadow Loss Adjustments reflected a decrease in future policy benefit liabilities.\n",

      "Overview\n",
      "Liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet our payment obligations. It is defined as cash and unencumbered assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost. We endeavor to manage our liquidity prudently through various risk committees, policies and procedures, and a stress testing and liquidity risk framework established by our Treasury group with oversight by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Our liquidity risk framework is designed to manage liquidity at both AIG Parent and its subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six months under a liquidity stress scenario.\n",
      "See Enterprise Risk Management - Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement and Enterprise Risk Management - Liquidity Risk Management below for additional information.\n",
      "AIG | 2018 Form 10-K 131\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Liquidity and Capital Resources\n",
      "Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. Our primary source of ongoing capital generation is derived from the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. We must comply with numerous constraints on our minimum capital positions. These constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy at AIG and the individual businesses and are based on internally-defined risk tolerances, regulatory requirements, rating agency and creditor expectations and business needs. Actual capital levels are monitored on a regular basis, and using ERM’s stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital impact of potential macroeconomic, financial and insurance stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraints of both AIG and our insurance subsidiaries.\n",
      "We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events.\n",
      "Nevertheless, some circumstances may cause our cash or capital needs to exceed projected liquidity or readily deployable capital resources. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash or capital needs and loss of sources of liquidity and capital. In addition, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.\n",
      "Depending on market conditions, regulatory and rating agency considerations and other factors, we may take various liability and capital management actions. Liability management actions may include, but are not limited to, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers. Capital management actions may include, but are not limited to, paying dividends to our shareholders and share and/or warrant repurchases.\n",

      "AIG Parent also received a net amount of $938 million in tax sharing payments in the form of cash from our insurance businesses in 2018, reflecting $120 million that was reimbursed by AIG Parent to our insurance businesses during the fourth quarter of 2018 primarily as a result of adjustments made to prior-year tax sharing payments. The tax sharing payments may be subject to further adjustment in future periods.\n",

AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities primarily include U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. Based upon an assessment of funding needs, the liquidity sources can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements or contributed as admitted assets to regulated insurance companies. AIG Parent liquidity is monitored through the use of various internal liquidity risk measures. AIG Parent’s primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from subsidiaries and credit facilities. AIG Parent’s primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, and operating expenses.\n",

We expect to access the debt markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed.\n",
      "We utilize our capital resources to support our businesses, with the majority of capital allocated to our insurance operations. Should we have or generate more capital than is needed to support our business strategies (including organic growth or acquisition opportunities) or mitigate risks inherent to our business, we may develop plans to distribute such capital to shareholders via dividends or share repurchase authorizations or deploy such capital towards liability management.\n",
      "In the normal course, it is expected that a portion of the capital released by our insurance operations, by our other operations or through the utilization of AIG’s deferred tax assets may be available to support our business strategies, for distribution to shareholders or for liability management.\n",

Large catastrophes may require us to provide additional support to our affected operations. Downgrades in our credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, which could result in non-renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect a subsidiary’s ability to meet its own obligations. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital. Other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include an economic collapse of a nation or region significant to our operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval.\n",
      "Management believes that because of the size and liquidity of our Life and Retirement companies’ investment portfolios, normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience would not create significant liquidity risk. Furthermore, our Life and Retirement companies’ products contain certain features that mitigate surrender risk, including surrender charges. However, in times of extreme capital markets disruption, liquidity needs could outpace resources. As part of their risk management framework, our Life and Retirement companies continue to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue strategies and programs to improve their liquidity position and facilitate their ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio.\n",

Under these programs, these U.S. Life and Retirement companies lend securities to financial institutions and receive cash as collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. Cash collateral received is invested in short-term investments. Additionally, the aggregate amount of securities that a Life and Retirement company is able to lend under its program at any time is limited to five percent of its general account statutory-basis admitted assets. Our U.S. Life and Retirement companies had $884 million and $2.9 billion of securities subject to these agreements at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and $904 million and $3.0 billion of liabilities to borrowers for collateral received at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\n",

These include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the Facility would restrict our access to the Facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

These liabilities include various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments. These liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. For these policies and contracts (i) we are not currently making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event beyond our control.\n",
      "We have made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits. These assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force policies. Due to the significance of the assumptions, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. The amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n",
      "We believe that our Life and Retirement companies have adequate financial resources to meet the payments actually required under these obligations. These subsidiaries have substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments. In addition, our Life and Retirement companies maintain significant levels of investment grade rated fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds, and could seek to monetize those holdings in the event operating cash flows are\n",

      "insufficient. We expect liquidity needs related to GIC liabilities to be funded through cash flows generated from maturities and sales of invested assets.\n",
      "Borrowings\n",
      "Our borrowings exclude those incurred by consolidated investments and include hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value. We expect to repay the long-term debt maturities and interest accrued on borrowings by AIG through maturing investments and dispositions of invested assets, future cash flows from operations, cash flows generated from invested assets, future debt issuance and other financing arrangements. Borrowings supported by assets of AIG include various notes and bonds payable as well as GIAs that are supported by cash and investments held by AIG Parent and certain non-insurance subsidiaries for the repayment of those obligations.\n",
      "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments\n",
      "The following table summarizes Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments in total, and by remaining maturity:\n",
      "(a) Excludes potential amounts for indemnification obligations included in asset sales agreements. For further information on indemnification obligations see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "(b) Includes commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the United States and abroad. The commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. The expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. Investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate subsidiaries.\n",

      "Indemnification Agreements\n",
      "We are subject to financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements in connection with our sales of businesses. These arrangements may be triggered by declines in asset values, specified business contingencies, the realization of contingent liabilities, litigation developments, or breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by us. These arrangements are typically subject to time limitations, defined by contract or by operation of law, such as by prevailing statutes of limitation. Depending on the specific terms of the arrangements, the maximum potential obligation may or may not be subject to contractual limitations.\n",
      "For additional information regarding our indemnification agreements see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "We have recorded liabilities for certain of these arrangements where it is possible to estimate them. These liabilities are not material in the aggregate. We are unable to develop a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential payout under some of these arrangements. Overall, we believe that it is unlikely we will have to make any material payments under these arrangements.\n",

      "We are party to some agreements that contain “ratings triggers.” Depending on the ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies, these triggers could result in (i) the termination or limitation of credit availability or a requirement for accelerated repayment, (ii) the termination of business contracts or (iii) a requirement to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.\n",
      "In the event of a downgrade of AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings, AIGFP and certain other AIG entities would be required to post additional collateral under some derivative and other transactions, or certain of the counterparties of AIGFP or of such other AIG entities would be permitted to terminate such transactions early.\n",
      "The actual amount of collateral that we would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "Risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns. We consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance.\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "We have an integrated process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm-wide risk appetite. Our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of AIG’s major risk positions. Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM. ERM supports our businesses and management by embedding risk management in our key day-to-day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing, monitoring, reporting, and mitigating the risks taken by our businesses and AIG overall. Nevertheless, our risk management efforts may not always be successful and material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or financial condition may occur.\n",
      "Risk Governance Structure\n",
      "Our risk governance structure fosters the development and maintenance of a risk and control management culture that encompasses all significant risk categories impacting our lines of business and functions. Accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit. We review our governance and committee structure on a regular basis and make changes as appropriate to continue to effectively manage and govern our risks and risk-taking.\n",
      "Our Board of Directors oversees the management of risk through its Risk and Capital Committee (RCC) and Audit Committee. Those committees regularly interact with other committees of the Board of Directors described below. Our Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reports to both the RCC and our Chief Executive Officer (CEO).\n",
      "The Group Risk Committee (GRC): The GRC is the senior management group responsible for assessing all significant risk issues on a global basis to protect our financial strength, optimize our intrinsic value, and protect our reputation. The GRC is chaired by our CRO. Its membership includes the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) and other senior executives from across our corporate functions and business units. Our CRO reports periodically on behalf of the GRC to both the RCC and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Our CRO is also a member of the ELT providing ERM the opportunity to contribute to, review, monitor and consider the impact of changes in strategy.\n",
      "Management committees that support the GRC are described below. These committees are comprised of senior executives and experienced business representatives from a range of functions and business units throughout AIG and its subsidiaries. These committees are charged with identifying, analyzing and reviewing specific risk matters within their respective mandates. In addition, various working groups (e.g. reputational risk, control agenda) are in place in support of the GRC to manage and monitor the various risks across the organization.\n",
      "Financial Risk Group (FRG): The FRG is responsible for the oversight of financial risks taken by AIG and our subsidiaries. Its mandate includes overseeing our aggregate credit, market, interest rate, capital, liquidity and model risks, as well as asset-liability management, derivatives activity, and foreign exchange transactions. It provides the primary corporate-level review function for all proposed transactions and business practices that are significant in size, complex in scope, or that present heightened legal, reputational, accounting or regulatory risks. The FRG is chaired by our CRO. Membership of the FRG also includes our CFO, Chief Investment Officer (CIO) and Treasurer.\n",
      "Business Unit Risk Committees: Each of our major insurance businesses has established a risk committee that serves as the senior management committee responsible for risk oversight at the individual business unit level. The risk committees are responsible for the identification, assessment and monitoring of all sources of risk within their respective portfolios. Specific responsibilities include setting risk tolerances, reviewing the capital allocation framework, insurance portfolio optimization, and providing oversight of risk-adjusted metrics. Together, these committees provide comprehensive risk oversight throughout the organization.\n",

      "Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement\n",
      "Risk Appetite Framework\n",
      "Our Risk Appetite Framework integrates stakeholder interests, strategic business goals and available financial resources. We balance these by seeking to take measured risks that are expected to generate repeatable, sustainable earnings and create long-term value for our shareholders. The framework includes our risk appetite statement approved by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof and a set of supporting tools, including risk tolerances, risk limits and policies, which we use to manage our risk profile and financial resources.\n",
      "We articulate our aggregate risk-taking by setting risk tolerances and thresholds on capital and liquidity measures. These measures are set at the AIG Parent level as well as the legal entity level and cover consolidated and insurance company capital and liquidity ratios. We must comply with standards for capital adequacy and maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all our obligations as they come due in accordance with our internal capital management and liquidity policies. Our risk tolerances take into consideration regulatory requirements, rating agency expectations, and business needs. The GRC routinely reviews the level of risk taken by the consolidated organization in relation to the established risk tolerances. A consolidated risk report is also presented periodically, as required, to the RCC by our CRO.\n",
      "Risk Limits\n",
      "A key component of our Risk Appetite Framework is having a process in place that establishes and maintains appropriate limits on the material risks identified for our core businesses and facilitates monitoring and meeting of both internal and external stakeholder expectations. Our objectives include:\n",
      "• Establishing risk monitoring, providing early warning indicators, and ensuring timely oversight and enforceability of limits;\n",
      "• Defining a consistent and transparent approach to limits governance; and\n",
      "• Aligning our business activities with our risk appetite statement.\n",
      "AIG | 2018 Form 10-K 145\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "To support the monitoring and management of AIG’s and its business units’ material risks, ERM has an established limits framework that employs a three-tiered hierarchy:\n",
      "• Board-level risk tolerances are AIG’s aggregate capital and liquidity limits. They define the minimum level of capital and liquidity that we should maintain. These board-level risk tolerances require RCC approval.\n",
      "• AIG management level limits are risk type specific limits at the AIG consolidated level. These limits are defined and calibrated to constrain our concentration in specific risk types, to protect against taking risks that exceed the amount of overall capital AIG has available, and to protect against excess earnings volatility. These limits are approved by our CRO with consultation from the GRC.\n",
      "• BU and legal entity level limits are set to address key risks identified by ERM for the business unit and legal entities, protect capital and liquidity at legal entities and/or meet legal entity specific requirements of regulators and rating agencies. These limits are defined by the business unit and legal entity Risk Officers.\n",
      "All limits are reviewed by the GRC or relevant business unit risk committees on a periodic basis and revisions, if applicable, are approved by those committees.\n",
      "The business units are responsible for measuring and monitoring their risk exposures. ERM is responsible for monitoring compliance with limits and providing regular, timely reporting to our senior management and risk committees. Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner and are documented and escalated in accordance with their level of severity or materiality.\n",
      "Risk Identification and Measurement\n",
      "One tool we use to inform our Risk Appetite Framework is risk identification. We conduct risk identification through a number of processes at the business unit and corporate level focused on capturing our material risks and key areas of focus for follow-up risk management actions. A key initiative is our integrated bottom-up risk identification and assessment process down to the product-line level. These processes are used as a critical input to enhance and develop our analytics for measuring and assessing risks across the organization.\n",
      "We employ various approaches to measure, monitor, and manage risk exposures, including the utilization of a variety of metrics and early warning indicators. We use a proprietary internal capital and stress testing framework to measure our quantifiable risks for both insurance and non-insurance operations.\n",
      "The internal capital framework quantifies our aggregate economic risk at a given confidence interval, after taking into account a level of diversification benefits between risk factors and business lines. We leverage the internal capital framework to help inform our consolidated risk consumption and profile as well as risk and capital allocation for our businesses.\n",
      "The stress testing framework assesses our aggregate exposure to our most significant financial and insurance risks, including the risk in each of our key insurance company subsidiaries in relation to its capital needs under stress, risks inherent in our non-insurance company subsidiaries, and risks to AIG consolidated capital. The framework measures risk over multiple time horizons and under different levels of stress, and includes multi-factor stresses as well as single factor sensitivities that are designed to reflect AIG’s risk characteristics. We use this information to support the assessment of resources needed at the AIG Parent level to support our subsidiaries and capital resources required to maintain consolidated company target capitalization levels.\n",

      "Credit Risk Management\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "Credit risk is defined as the risk that our customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due. Credit risk may also result from a downgrade of a counterparty’s credit ratings or a widening of its credit spreads.\n",
      "We devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures. These exposures may arise from, but are not limited to, fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees, letters of credit, and certain General Insurance businesses.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Our credit risks are managed by teams of credit professionals, subject to ERM oversight and various control processes. Their primary role is to assure appropriate credit risk management in accordance with our credit policies and procedures relative to our credit risk parameters. Our Chief Credit Officer (CCO) and credit executives are primarily responsible for the development, implementation and maintenance of a risk management framework, which includes the following elements related to our credit risks:\n",
      "• developing and implementing our company-wide credit policies and procedures;\n",
      "• approving delegated credit authorities to our credit executives and qualified credit professionals;\n",
      "• developing methodologies for quantification and assessment of credit risks, including the establishment and maintenance of our internal risk rating process;\n",
      "• managing a system of credit and program limits, as well as the approval process for credit transactions, above limit exposures, and concentrations of risk that may exist or be incurred;\n",
      "• evaluating, monitoring, reviewing and reporting of credit risks and concentrations regularly with senior management; and\n",
      "• approving appropriate credit reserves, credit-related other-than-temporary impairments and corresponding methodologies for all credit portfolios.\n",
      "We monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require mitigants, such as third-party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, including commercial bank-issued letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. We treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, and letters of credit as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data. We also monitor closely the quality of any trust collateral accounts.\n",

      "We are engaged in a variety of insurance, investment and other financial services businesses that expose us to market risk, directly and indirectly. We are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities, on both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet through on- and off-balance sheet exposures. The Risk Officer within each business is responsible for creating a framework to properly identify these risks, then ensuring that they are appropriately measured, monitored and managed in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the Chief Market Risk Officer (CMRO).\n",
      "The scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner consistent with our risk appetite statement. Our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in these broad market observables, as opposed to the idiosyncratic risks associated with individual assets that are addressed through our credit risk management function.\n",
      "Many of our market risk exposures, including exposures to interest rates and equity, are associated with the asset and liability exposures of our Life and Retirement companies. These exposures are generally long-term in nature. Examples of liability-related exposures include interest rate sensitive surrenders in our fixed deferred annuity product portfolio. Also, we have equity market risk sensitive surrenders in our variable annuity product portfolio. These interactive asset-liability types of risk exposures are regularly monitored in accordance with the risk governance framework noted above.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "Risk Identification\n",
      "Market risk focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in broad, external, predominantly market-observable risks. Financial repercussions can include an adverse impact on results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital.\n",
      "Each of the following systemic risks is considered a market risk:\n",
      "Equity prices\n",
      "We are exposed to changes in equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments. Changes in equity prices can affect the valuation of publicly traded equity shares, investments in private equity, hedge funds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other equity-linked capital market instruments as well as equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities, indexed universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance.\n",
      "Residential and commercial real estate values\n",
      "Our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments. Changes in residential/commercial real estate prices can affect the valuation of residential/commercial mortgages, residential/commercial mortgage-backed securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential/commercial mortgages, trusts that include residential/commercial real estate and/or mortgages, residential mortgage insurance and reinsurance contracts and commercial real estate investments.\n",
      "Interest rates\n",
      "Interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities. Lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and make some of our product offerings less attractive to investors. Conversely, higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons. However, when rates rise quickly, there can be an asymmetric GAAP accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income, and the offsetting decrease in the value of certain liabilities may not be recognized. Changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, financial liabilities, insurance contracts including but not limited to universal life, fixed rate annuities, variable annuities and derivative contracts. Additionally, for Variable Annuity, Index Annuity, and Equity Indexed Universal Life products, deviations in actual versus expected policyholder behavior can be driven by fluctuations in various market variables, including interest rates. Policies with guaranteed living benefit options or riders are also subject to the risk of actual benefit utilization being different than expected.\n",
      "Credit spreads\n",
      "Credit spreads measure an instrument’s risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default-free instrument. Changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including but not limited to corporate bonds, ABS, mortgage-backed securities, AIG-issued debt obligations, credit derivatives and derivative credit valuation adjustments. Much like higher interest rates, wider credit spreads with unchanged default losses mean more investment income in the long term. In the short term, quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income. A precipitous widening of credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the credit worthiness of bond obligors, potentially resulting in default losses.\n",
      "Foreign exchange (FX) rates\n",
      "We are a globally diversified enterprise with income, assets and liabilities denominated in, and capital deployed in, a variety of currencies.

Market Risk is managed by our finance, treasury and investment management corporate functions, collectively, and in partnership with ERM. The CMRO is primarily responsible for the development and maintenance of a risk management framework that includes the following key components:\n",

At the firm-wide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with AIG’s risk appetite statement. This is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework. Our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital and liquidity levels. At the market risk level, the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change on an economic basis.\n",

      "(b) At December 31, 2018, the analysis covered $278.4 billion of $285.8 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded were $3.5 billion of loans. In addition, $3.9 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations. At December 31, 2017, the analysis covered $276.8 billion of $289.6 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded were $8.2 billion of loans. In addition, $4.6 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations.\n",
      "(c) Beginning in the third quarter of 2018, the economic effect presented for Policyholder contract deposits - investment-type contracts has been refined to better reflect the economic effect on the balance sheet and is calculated as the change to the estimated fair value from a 100 bps parallel increase in all yield curves on the estimated fair value. Historically, the calculation was the change between the carrying value and the estimated fair value from a 100 bps parallel increase in all yield curves on the estimated fair value. Prior period presentation has been revised to conform to the current period approach.\n",
      "(d) At December 31, 2018, the analysis excluded $8.4 billion of long-term debt related to debt of consolidated investments, $643 million of AIGLH borrowings, $359 million of Validus borrowings, $168 million of borrowings from FHLB and $331 million of AIG Japan Holdings loans. At December 31, 2017, the analysis excluded $6.0 billion of long-term debt related to debt of consolidated investments, $642 million of AIGLH borrowings, $190 million of borrowings from the FHLB and $334 million of AIG Japan Holdings loans.\n",

      "(f) Beginning in the third quarter of 2018, the economic effect calculation presented for Derivatives - equity contracts is calculated using an internal risk calculation model. The prior period presentation of the economic effect was calculated as the effect of a 20 percent decline on the estimated fair value. Prior period presentation has been revised to conform to the current period approach.\n",

      "The sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed as predictive of our future financial performance. We cannot ensure that our actual losses in any particular period will not exceed the amounts indicated above.\n",
      "Interest rate sensitivity is defined as change in its value with respect to plus a 100 basis point change in the interest rate environment, calculated as: scenario value minus base value, where base value is the value of the derivative under the yield curves as of the period end and scenario value is the value reflecting a 100 basis point parallel increase in all yield curves.\n",
      "We evaluate our interest rate risk without the effect of any correlation among other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities. This scenario does not measure changes in value resulting from non-parallel shifts in the yield curve, which could produce different results.\n",
      "We evaluate our equity price risk without the effect of any correlation among other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities. This scenario considers the direct impact of declines in equity prices and not changes in asset-based fees, changes in the estimated gross profits used for amortizing DAC, or changes in any other assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the embedded derivatives related to the living benefit features within variable annuity products. In addition, this scenario does not reflect the impact of basis risk, such as projections about the future performance of the underlying contract holder funds and actual fund returns, which we use as a basis for developing our hedging strategy.\n",

We use a bottom-up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory capital at the regulated insurance entity level. At the AIG consolidated level, we monitor our foreign currency exposures against single currency and aggregate currency portfolio limits.\n",
      "Our foreign currency-denominated net asset position at December 31, 2018, decreased by $1.2 billion compared to December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a $669 million decrease in our Japanese yen position and a $264 million decrease in our Canadian dollar position, each due to an increase in loss reserves.\n",
      "For illustrative purposes, we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The estimated results presented in the table above should not be taken as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events.\n",

There is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. We manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. For further information see Critical Accounting Estimates - Insurance Liabilities - Loss Reserves herein.\n",
      "• Underwriting - The potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the General Insurance companies’ ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. This may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, worse than expected prepayment of policies, investment results, or unexpected or increased costs or expenses.\n",
      "• Catastrophe Exposure - Our business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect our operating results. Other risks, such as man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n",
      "• Single Risk Loss Exposure - Our business is exposed to loss events that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. Events such as fires or explosions can result in loss activity for our clients. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by our GRC through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance. Furthermore, single risk loss exposure is managed and monitored on both a segregated and aggregated basis.\n",
      "• Reinsurance - Since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated. The inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n",
      "Natural Catastrophe Risk\n",
      "We manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate Probable Maximum Loss (PML) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.\n",
      "We use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. We apply a proprietary multi-model approach to account for relative strengths and weaknesses of vendor models and make adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.\n",
      "We perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model weaknesses, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. Lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts that allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.\n",
      "We recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policy to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. For example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. In addition, we are committed to providing innovative insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change, including expanding natural disaster resilience, promoting adaptation, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Our internal product development, underwriting, modeling, and sustainability practices will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.\n",
      "Our natural catastrophe exposure is primarily driven by the U.S. and Japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries. For example, we have exposures to additional perils such as European windstorms and floods and seismic events across the Pacific Rim. Within the U.S., we have significant hurricane exposure in Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, the Northeast U.S. and mid-Atlantic regions. Events impacting the Northeast U.S. and the mid-Atlantic may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in those regions. Within the U.S., we have significant earthquake exposure in California, the Pacific Northwest and New Madrid regions. Earthquakes impacting the Pacific Northwest and New Madrid regions may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in these regions.\n",

The catastrophe reinsurance program is as of January 1, 2019. Other reinsurance covers are as of December 31, 2018.\n",
      "AIG, along with other property casualty insurance and reinsurance companies, uses industry-recognized catastrophe models and applies proprietary modeling processes and assumptions to arrive at loss estimates. The use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially change the projected losses. Since there is no industry standard for assumptions and preparation of insured data for use in these models, our modeled losses may not be comparable to estimates made by other companies.\n",
      "Also, the modeled results are based on the assumption that all reinsurers fulfill their obligations to us under the terms of the reinsurance arrangements. However, reinsurance recoverables may not be fully collectible. Therefore, these estimates are inherently uncertain and may not accurately reflect our exposure to these events.\n",
      "Our 2019 catastrophe reinsurance program provides protection on both an aggregate and occurrence basis.

      "We actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. We have set risk limits based on modeled losses from certain terrorism attack scenarios. Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model for various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the General Insurance companies’ exposures. Examples of modeled scenarios are conventional bombs of different sizes, anthrax attacks and nuclear attacks.\n",
      "Our largest terrorism exposures are in New York City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers’ Compensation lines of business. At our largest exposure location, modeled losses for a five-ton bomb attack net of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIP) and reinsurance recoveries are estimated to be $2.8 billion based on the exposures as of September 30, 2018.\n",
      "Our exposure to terrorism risk in the U.S. is mitigated by TRIP in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIP covers terrorist attacks within the United States or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law. In 2019, TRIP covers 81 percent of insured losses above a deductible, decreasing to 80 percent in 2020. The current estimate of our deductible is approximately $2.0 billion for 2018.\n",
      "We offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. We also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n",
      "Life and Retirement Companies’ Key Risks\n",
      "We manage risk through product design, experience monitoring, pricing actions, risk limitations, reinsurance and active monitoring and management of the relationships between assets and liabilities, including hedging.\n",
      "For Life and Retirement companies, risks include the following:\n",
      "• Longevity risk - represents the risk of an increase in value of a policy or benefit as a result of actual mortality rates being lower than the expected mortality rates. This risk could arise from medical advancement and longer-term societal health changes. This risk exists in a number of our product lines but is most significant for our annuity products, structured settlements and pension risk transfer business.\n",
      "• Morbidity risk - represents the risk arising from actual morbidity (e.g. illness, disability or disease) incidence rate being higher than expected or the length of the claims extending longer than expected resulting in a higher overall benefit payout. This risk could arise from longer-term medical advances in detection and treatment for various diseases and medical conditions. This risk exists in a number of our product lines such as group benefits and long-term care businesses - which are in run-off or no longer being sold.\n",
      "• Mortality risk - represents the risk of loss arising from actual mortality rates being higher than expected mortality rates. This risk could arise from pandemics or other events, including longer-term societal changes that cause higher-than-expected mortality. This risk exists in a number of our product lines, but is most significant for our life insurance products.\n",
      "160 AIG | 2018 Form 10-K\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "• Policyholder behavior risk (including full and partial surrender/lapse risk) - represents the risk that actual policyholder behavior differs from expected behavior in a manner that has an adverse effect on our operating results. There are many related assumptions made when products are sold, including how long the contracts will persist and other assumptions which impact the expected utilization of contract benefits, options and guarantees. Actual experience can vary significantly from these assumptions. This risk is impacted by a number of factors including changes in market conditions, especially changes in the levels of interest rate and equity markets, tax law, regulations, competitive landscape and policyholder preferences. This risk exists in many of our product lines, but most notably within the annuity portfolio of business.\n",
      "The emergence of significant adverse experience compared to the initial assumptions at policy issuance or updated assumption would require an adjustment to DAC and benefit reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for a particular period.\n",
      "For additional discussion of the impact of actual and expected experience on DAC and benefit reserves see Critical Accounting Estimates - Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health Insurance Contracts and Critical Accounting Estimates - Guaranteed Benefit Features of Variable Annuity Products. For additional discussion of business risks see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Business and Operations.\n",
      "Variable Annuity Risk Management and Hedging Programs\n",
      "Our Individual and Group Retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with guaranteed living benefit (GLB) riders that guarantee a certain level of lifetime benefits. GLBs are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses). GLB features subject the Life and Retirement companies to market risk, including exposure to changes in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility.\n",
      "Variable annuity product design is the first step in managing our exposure to these market risks. Risk mitigation features of our variable annuity product design include GLB rider fees indexed to an equity market volatility index, which can provide additional fee assessments in periods of increased market volatility, required minimum allocations to fixed accounts to reduce overall equity exposure, and for some of the variable annuity products, the utilization of volatility control funds, which reduce equity exposure in the funds in response to changes in market volatility, even under sudden or extreme market movements.\n",
      "After reflecting our product risk-mitigating features, we hedge our remaining economic exposure to market risk within GLB features through our variable annuity hedging program, which is designed to offset certain changes in the economic value of these GLB embedded derivatives, within established thresholds. The hedging program is designed to provide additional protection against large and combined movements in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility under multiple scenarios.\n",
      "Our hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents our estimate of the underlying economic risks in our GLB riders, based on the present value of the future expected benefit payments for the GLB, less the present value of future GLB rider fees, over numerous stochastic scenarios. This stochastic projection method uses best estimate assumptions for policyholder behavior (including mortality, lapses, withdrawals and benefit utilization) in conjunction with market scenarios calibrated to observable equity and interest rate option prices. Policyholder behaviors are regularly evaluated to compare current assumptions to actual experience and, if appropriate, changes are made to the policyholder behavior assumptions. The risk of changes in policyholder behavior is not explicitly hedged and such differences between expected and actual policyholder behaviors will result in hedge ineffectiveness.\n",
      "Due to differences between the calculation of the economic hedge target and U.S. GAAP valuation of the embedded derivative, which include differences in the treatment of rider fees and exclusion of certain risk margins and other differences in discount rates, we expect relative movements in the economic hedge target and the U.S. GAAP embedded derivative valuation will vary over time with changes in equity markets, interest rates and credit spreads.\n",
      "For information on the impact on our consolidated pre-tax income from the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives and the hedging portfolio, as well as additional discussion of differences between the economic hedge target and the valuation of the embedded derivatives see Insurance Reserves - Life and Annuity Reserves and DAC - Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefits and Hedging Results.\n",
      "In designing our hedging portfolio for our variable annuity hedging program, we make assumptions and projections about the future performance of the underlying contract holder funds. To project future account value changes, we make assumptions about how each of the underlying funds will perform. We map the contract holder funds to a set of publicly traded indices that we believe best represent the liability to be hedged. Basis risk exists due to the variance between these assumptions and actual fund returns, which may result in variances between changes in the hedging portfolio and changes in the economic hedge target. Net hedge results and the cost of hedging are also impacted by differences between realized volatility and implied volatility.\n",
      "AIG | 2018 Form 10-K 161\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "For index annuity and universal life products, we have a hedging program designed to manage the index crediting strategies associated with index annuity and index life products. This hedging program is designed to offset the economic risk with respect to the index returns for the current crediting rate reset period, and utilizes derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity index options and futures contracts. Similarly as with the variable annuities, there are differences between the calculation of the economic hedge target and U.S. GAAP valuation of the index annuity and index life embedded derivatives, which can lead to variances in their relative movements.\n",
      "To manage the capital market exposures embedded within the economic hedge target, we identify and hedge market sensitivities to changes in equity markets, interest rates, volatility and for variable annuities, credit spreads. Each hedge program purchases derivative instruments or securities having sensitivities that offset corresponding sensitivities in the associated economic hedge targets, within internally defined threshold limits. Since the relative movements of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target vary over time or with market changes, the net exposure can be outside the threshold limits, and adjustments to the hedging portfolio are made periodically to return the net exposure to within the threshold limits.\n",
      "Our hedging programs utilize various derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts, interest rate swaps and swaptions, as well as other hedging instruments. In addition, within the variable annuities hedging program, we purchase certain fixed income securities and elect the fair value option as a capital efficient way to manage interest rate and credit spread exposures. To minimize counterparty credit risk the majority of the derivative instruments utilized within the hedging programs are cleared through global exchanges. Over the counter derivatives utilized within the hedging programs are highly collateralized.\n",
      "The hedging programs are monitored on a daily basis to ensure that the economic hedge targets and the associated derivative portfolios are within the threshold limits, pursuant to the approved hedging strategy. Daily risk monitoring verifies that the net risk exposures are within the approved net risk exposure threshold limits. In addition, monthly stress tests are performed to determine the program’s effectiveness relative to the applicable limits, under an array of combined severe market stresses in equity prices, interest rates, volatility and credit spreads. Finally, hedging strategies are reviewed regularly to gauge their effectiveness in managing our market exposures in the context of our overall risk appetite.\n",
      "Reinsurance Activities\n",
      "Reinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss (Life and Non-Life) exposure related to certain events such as natural and man-made catastrophes or death events. Our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.\n",
      "Reinsurance markets include:\n",
      "• Traditional local and global reinsurance markets including those in the United States, Bermuda, London and Europe, accessed directly and through reinsurance intermediaries;\n",
      "• Capital markets through insurance-linked securities and collateralized reinsurance transactions, such as catastrophe bonds, sidecars and similar vehicles; and\n",
      "• Other insurers that engage in both direct and assumed reinsurance.\n",
      "The form of reinsurance we may choose from time to time will generally depend on whether we are seeking:\n",
      "• proportional reinsurance, whereby we cede a specified percentage of premiums and losses to reinsurers;\n",

      "We continually evaluate the relative attractiveness of different forms of reinsurance contracts and different markets that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives.\n",
      "Reinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. However, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.\n",
      "In certain markets, we are required to participate on a proportional basis in reinsurance pools based on our relative share of direct writings in those markets. Such mandatory reinsurance generally covers higher-risk consumer exposures such as assigned-risk automobile and earthquake, as well as certain commercial exposures such as workers’ compensation.\n",

      "Reinsurance Recoverable\n",
      "AIG’s reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of:\n",
      "• Paid losses recoverable - balances due from reinsurers for losses and loss adjustment expenses paid by our subsidiaries and billed, but not yet collected.\n",
      "• Ceded loss reserves - ultimate ceded reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, including reserves for claims reported but not yet paid and estimates for IBNR.\n",
      "• Ceded reserves for unearned premiums.\n",
      "• Life and Annuity reinsurance recoverables (ceded policy and claim reserves).\n",
      "At December 31, 2018, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $38.2 billion. These assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $1.5 billion, ceded loss reserves of $32.0 billion including reserves for incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $3.0 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverable of $1.7 billion. The methods used to estimate IBNR and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. These methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments are reflected in income. We believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at December 31, 2018 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. Actual losses may, however, differ from the reserves currently ceded.\n",
      "The Reinsurance Credit Department (RCD) conducts periodic detailed assessments of the financial strength and condition of current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic. The RCD monitors both the financial condition of reinsurers as well as the total reinsurance recoverable ceded to reinsurers, and sets limits with regard to the amount and type of exposure we are willing to take with reinsurers. As part of these assessments, we attempt to identify whether a reinsurer is appropriately licensed, assess its financial capacity and liquidity, and evaluate the local economic and financial environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates. The RCD reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for measures, including collateral to mitigate credit risk. For example, in our treaty reinsurance contracts, we frequently include provisions that require a reinsurer to post collateral or use other measures to reduce exposure when a referenced event occurs. Furthermore, we limit our unsecured exposure to reinsurers through the use of credit triggers such as insurer financial strength rating downgrades, declines in regulatory capital, or relevant risk-based capital (RBC) ratios fall below certain levels. We also set maximum limits for reinsurance recoverable exposure, which in some cases is the recoverable amount plus an estimate of the maximum potential exposure from unexpected events for a reinsurer. In addition, credit executives within ERM review reinsurer exposures and credit limits and approve reinsurer credit limits above specified levels. Finally, even where we conclude that uncollateralized credit risk is acceptable, we require collateral from active reinsurance counterparties where it is necessary for our subsidiaries to recognize the reinsurance recoverable assets for statutory accounting purposes. At December 31, 2018, we held $20.2 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers.\n",
      "The following table presents information for each reinsurer representing in excess of five percent of our total reinsurance recoverable assets:\n",
      "(a) The financial strength ratings reflect the ratings of the various reinsurance subsidiaries of the companies listed as of January 29, 2019.\n",
      "(b) Total reinsurance assets include both Property Casualty and Life and Retirement reinsurance recoverable.\n",
      "(c) Excludes collateral held in excess of applicable treaty balances.\n",
      "(d) Includes $13.8 billion recoverable under the 2011 retroactive asbestos reinsurance transaction and the 2017 Adverse Development Reinsurance agreement.\n",
      "At December 31, 2018, we had no significant reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. Reinsurer capital levels continued to increase in 2018, thereby increasing the industry’s underwriting capacity, which resulted in continued competition and lower rates for 2019 renewals. Reduced profitability associated with lower rates could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. The RCD, in conjunction with the credit executives within ERM, reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require the reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.\n",

Credit risk associated with derivative counterparties exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to us. The maximum potential exposure will increase or decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions. All derivative transactions must be transacted within counterparty limits that have been approved by ERM.\n",
      "We evaluate counterparty credit quality by internal analysis consistent with the AIG Credit Policy. We utilize various credit enhancements, including letters of credit, guarantees, collateral, credit triggers, credit derivatives, margin agreements and subordination to reduce the credit risk relating to outstanding financial derivative transactions. We require credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties, and transaction size and maturity. Furthermore, we enter into certain agreements that have the benefit of set-off and close-out netting provisions, such as ISDA Master Agreements. These provisions provide that, in the case of an early termination of a transaction, we can set off receivables from a counterparty against payables to the same counterparty arising out of all covered transactions. As a result, where a legally enforceable netting agreement exists, the fair value of the transaction with the counterparty represents the net sum of estimated fair values.\n",

These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses (which for General Insurance excludes net loss reserve discount), and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. Our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under GAAP, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios.\n",

      "Overview of Loss Reserving Process and Methods\n",
      "Our loss reserves can generally be categorized into two distinct groups. Short-tail reserves consists principally of U.S. Property and Special Risks, Europe Property and Special Risks, U.S. Personal Insurance, and Europe and Japan Personal Insurance. Long-tail reserves include U.S. Workers’ Compensation, U.S. Excess Casualty, U.S. Other Casualty, U.S. Financial Lines, Europe Casualty and Financial Lines, and U.S. Run-off Long Tail Insurance Lines.\n",
      "Short-Tail Reserves\n",
      "For our short-tail coverages, such as property, where the nature of claims is generally high frequency with short reporting periods, with volatility arising from occasional severe events, the process for recording non-catastrophe quarterly loss reserves is geared toward maintaining IBNR based on percentages of net earned premiums for that business, rather than projecting ultimate loss ratios based on reported losses. For example, the IBNR reserve required for the latest accident quarter for a product line such as homeowners might be approximately 20 percent of the quarter’s earned premiums. This level of reserve would generally be recorded regardless of the actual losses reported in the current quarter, thus recognizing severe events as they occur. The percent of premium factor reflects both our expectation of the ultimate loss costs associated with the line of business and the expectation of the percentage of ultimate loss costs that have not yet been reported. The expected ultimate loss costs generally reflect the average loss costs from a period of preceding accident quarters that have been adjusted for changes in rate and loss cost levels, mix of business, known exposure to unreported losses, or other factors affecting the particular line of business. The expected percentage of ultimate loss costs that have not yet been reported would be derived from historical loss emergence patterns. For more mature quarters, specific loss development methods would be used to determine the IBNR. For other product lines where the nature of claims is high frequency but low severity, methods including loss development, frequency/severity or a multiple of average monthly losses may be used to determine IBNR reserves. IBNR for claims arising from catastrophic events or events of unusual severity would be determined in close collaboration with the claims department’s knowledge of known information, using alternative techniques or expected percentages of ultimate loss cost emergence based on historical loss emergence of similar claim types.\n",
      "Long-Tail Reserves\n",
      "Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss adjustment expenses (net losses) for our long-tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the product line and volume of business, as well as estimates of reinsurance recoveries. Experience in the more recent accident years generally provides limited statistical credibility of reported net losses on long-tail casualty lines of business. That is because in the more recent accident years, a relatively low proportion of estimated ultimate net incurred losses are reported or paid. Therefore, IBNR reserves constitute a relatively high proportion of net losses.\n",
      "For our longer-tail lines, we generally make actuarial and other assumptions with respect to the following:\n",
      "· Loss cost trend factors are used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on the projected loss ratios for prior accident years.\n",
      "· Expected loss ratios are used for the latest accident year (i.e., accident year 2017 for the year-end 2017 loss reserve analysis) and, in some cases for accident years prior to the latest accident year. The expected loss ratio generally reflects the projected loss ratio from prior accident years, adjusted for the loss cost trend and the effect of rate changes and other quantifiable factors on the loss ratio. For low-frequency, high-severity lines of business such as excess casualty, expected loss ratios generally are used for at least the three most recent accident years.\n",
      "· Loss development factors are used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate basis. Generally, the actual loss development factors observed from prior accident years would be used as a basis to determine the loss development factors for the subsequent accident years.\n",
      "· Tail factors are development factors used for certain longer tailed lines of business (for example, excess casualty, workers’ compensation and general liability),to project future loss development for periods that extend beyond the available development data. The development of losses to the ultimate loss for a given accident year for these lines may take decades and the projection of ultimate losses for an accident year is very sensitive to the tail factors selected beyond a certain age.\n",

      "We record quarterly changes in loss reserves for each product line of business. The overall change in our loss reserves is based on the sum of the changes for all product lines of business. For most long-tail product lines of business, the quarterly loss reserve changes are based on the estimated current loss ratio for each subset of coverage less any amounts paid. Also, any change in estimated ultimate losses from prior accident years deemed to be necessary based on the results of our latest detailed valuation reviews, large loss analyses, or other analytical techniques, either positive or negative, is reflected in the loss reserve and incurred losses for the current quarter. Differences between actual loss emergence in a given period and our expectations based on prior loss reserve estimates are used to monitor reserve adequacy between detailed valuation reviews and may also influence our judgment with respect to adjusting reserve estimates.\n",
      "Details of the Loss Reserving Process\n",
      "The process of determining the current loss ratio for each product line of business is based on a variety of factors. These include considerations such as: prior accident year and policy year loss ratios; rate changes; and changes in coverage, reinsurance, or mix of business. Other considerations include actual and anticipated changes in external factors such as trends in loss costs, inflation, employment rates or unemployment duration or in the legal and claims environment. The current loss ratio for each product line of business is intended to represent our best estimate after reflecting all of the relevant factors. At the close of each quarter, the assumptions and data underlying the loss ratios are reviewed to determine whether the loss ratios remain appropriate. This process includes a review of the actual loss experience in the quarter, actual rate changes achieved, actual changes in reinsurance, quantifiable changes in coverage or mix of business, and changes in other factors that may affect the loss ratio. When this review suggests that the previously determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate, the loss ratio is changed to reflect the revised estimates.\n",
      "We conduct a comprehensive loss detailed valuation review at least annually for each product line of business in accordance with Actuarial Standards of Practice. These standards provide that the unpaid loss estimate may be presented in a variety of ways, such as a point estimate, a range of estimates, a point estimate based on the expected value of several reasonable estimates, or a probability distribution of the unpaid loss amount. Our actuarial best estimate for each product line of business represents an expected value generally considering a range of reasonably possible outcomes.\n",
      "The reserve analysis for each product line of business is performed by a credentialed actuarial team in collaboration with claims, underwriting, business unit management, risk management and senior management. Our actuaries consider the ongoing applicability of prior data groupings and update numerous assumptions, including the analysis and selection of loss development and loss trend factors. They also determine and select the appropriate actuarial or other methods used to estimate reserve adequacy for each business product line, and may employ multiple methods and assumptions for each product line. These data groupings, accident year weights, method selections and assumptions necessarily change over time as business mix changes, development factors mature and become more credible and loss characteristics evolve. In the course of these detailed valuation reviews an actuarial best estimate of the loss reserve is determined. The sum of these estimates for each product line of business yields an overall actuarial best estimate for that line of business.\n",
      "For certain product lines, we measure sensitivities and determine explicit ranges around the actuarial best estimate using multiple methodologies and varying assumptions. Where we have ranges, we use them to inform our selection of best estimates of loss reserves by major product line of business. Our range of reasonable estimates is not intended to cover all possibilities or extreme values and is based on known data and facts at the time of estimation.\n",
      "We consult with third party environmental litigation and engineering specialists, third party toxic tort claims professionals, third party clinical and public health specialists, third party workers’ compensation claims adjusters and third party actuarial advisors to help inform our judgments, as needed.\n",
      "A critical component of our detailed valuation reviews is an internal peer review of our reserving analyses and conclusions, where actuaries independent of the initial review evaluate the reasonableness of assumptions used, methods selected and weightings given to different methods. In addition, each detailed valuation review is subjected to a review and challenge process by specialists in our Enterprise Risk Management group.\n",

      "Actuarial and Other Methods for Major Lines of Business\n",
      "Our actuaries determine the appropriate actuarial methods and segmentation. This determination is based on a variety of factors including the nature of the losses associated with the product line of business, such as the frequency or severity of the claims. In addition to determining the actuarial methods, the actuaries determine the appropriate loss reserve groupings of data. This determination is a judgmental, dynamic process and refinements to the groupings are made every year. The changes to groupings may be driven by and may change to reflect observed or emerging patterns within and across product lines, or to differentiate different risk characteristics (for example, size of deductibles and extent of third party claims specialists used by our insureds). As an example of reserve segmentation, we write many unique subsets of professional liability, which cover different products, industry segments, and coverage structures. While for pricing or other purposes, it may be appropriate to evaluate the profitability of each subset individually, we believe it is appropriate to combine the subsets into larger groups for reserving purposes to produce a greater degree of credibility in the loss experience. This determination of data segmentation and related actuarial methods is assessed, reviewed and updated at least annually.\n",
      "The actuarial methods we use most commonly include paid and incurred loss development methods, expected loss ratio methods, including “Bornhuetter Ferguson” and “Cape Cod”, and frequency/severity models. Loss development methods utilize the actual loss development patterns from prior accident years updated through the current year to project the reported losses to an ultimate basis for all accident years. We also use this information to update our current accident year loss selections. Loss development methods are generally most appropriate for classes of business that exhibit a stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next, and for which the components of the product line have similar development characteristics. For example, property exposures would generally not be combined into the same product line as casualty exposures, and primary casualty exposures would generally not be combined into the same product line as excess casualty exposures. We continually refine our loss reserving techniques and adopt further segmentations based on our analysis of differing emerging loss patterns for certain product lines. We generally use expected loss ratio methods in cases where the reported loss data lacked sufficient credibility to utilize loss development methods, such as for new product lines of business or for long-tail product lines at early stages of loss development. Frequency/severity models may be used where sufficient frequency counts are available to apply such approaches.\n",
      "Expected loss ratio methods rely on the application of an expected loss ratio to the earned premium for the product line of business to determine the liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses. For example, an expected loss ratio of 70 percent applied to an earned premium base of $10 million for a product line of business would generate an ultimate loss estimate of $7 million. Subtracting any paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve for this product line. Under the Bornhuetter Ferguson methods, the expected loss ratio is applied only to the expected unreported portion of the losses. For example, for a long-tail product line of business for which only 10 percent of the losses are expected to be reported at the end of the accident year, the expected loss ratio would be used to represent the 90 percent of losses still unreported. The actual reported losses at the end of the accident year would be added to determine the total ultimate loss estimate for the accident year. Subtracting the reported paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve. In the example above, the expected loss ratio of 70 percent would be multiplied by 90 percent. The result of 63 percent would be applied to the earned premium of $10 million resulting in an estimated unreported loss of $6.3 million. Actual reported losses would be added to arrive at the total ultimate losses. If the reported losses were $1 million, the ultimate loss estimate under the Bornhuetter Ferguson method would be $7.3 million versus the $7 million amount under the expected loss ratio method described above. Thus, the Bornhuetter Ferguson method gives partial credibility to the actual loss experience to date for the product line of business. Loss development methods generally give full credibility to the reported loss experience to date. In the example above, loss development methods would typically indicate an ultimate loss estimate of $10 million, as the reported losses of $1 million would be estimated to reflect only 10 percent of the ultimate losses.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Critical Accounting Estimates\n",
      "A key advantage of loss development methods is that they respond more quickly to any actual changes in loss costs for the product line of business. Therefore, if loss experience is unexpectedly deteriorating or improving, the loss development method gives full credibility to the changing experience. Expected loss ratio methods would be slower to respond to the change, as they would continue to give more weight to a prior expected loss ratio, until enough evidence emerged to modify the expected loss ratio to reflect the changing loss experience. On the other hand, loss development methods have the disadvantage of overreacting to changes in reported losses if the loss experience is anomalous due to the various key factors described above and the inherent volatility in some of the classes. For example, the presence or absence of large losses at the early stages of loss development could cause the loss development method to overreact to the favorable or unfavorable experience by assuming it is a fundamental shift in the development pattern. In these instances, expected loss ratio methods such as Bornhuetter Ferguson have the advantage of recognizing large losses without extrapolating unusual large loss activity onto the unreported portion of the losses for the accident year.\n",
      "The Cape Cod method is a hybrid between the loss development and Bornhuetter Ferguson methods, where the historic loss data and loss development factor assumptions are used to determine the expected loss ratio estimate in the Bornhuetter Ferguson method.\n",
      "Frequency/severity methods generally rely on the determination of an ultimate number of claims and an average severity for each claim for each accident year. Multiplying the estimated ultimate number of claims for each accident year by the expected average severity of each claim produces the estimated ultimate loss for the accident year. Frequency/severity methods generally require a sufficient volume of claims in order for the average severity to be predictable. Average severity for subsequent accident years is generally determined by applying an estimated annual loss cost trend to the estimated average claim severity from prior accident years. In certain cases, a structural approach may also be used to predict the ultimate loss cost. Frequency/severity methods have the advantage that ultimate claim counts can generally be estimated more quickly and accurately than can ultimate losses. Thus, if the average claim severity can be accurately estimated, these methods can more quickly respond to changes in loss experience than other methods. However, for average severity to be predictable, the product line of business must consist of homogenous types of claims for which loss severity trends from one year to the next are reasonably consistent and where there are limited changes to deductible levels or limits. Generally these methods work best for high frequency, low severity product lines of business such as personal auto. However, frequency and severity metrics are also used to test the reasonability of results for other product lines of business and provide indications of underlying trends in the data. In addition, ultimate claim counts can be used as an alternative exposure measure to earned premiums in the Cape Cod method.\n",
      "Structural driver analytics seek to explain the underlying drivers of frequency/severity. A structural driver analysis of frequency/severity is particularly useful for understanding the key drivers of uncertainty in the ultimate loss cost. For example, for the excess workers’ compensation product line of business, we have attempted to corroborate our judgment by considering the impact on severity of the future potential for deterioration of an injured worker’s medical condition, the impact of price inflation on the various categories of medical expense and cost of living adjustments on indemnity benefits, the impact of injured worker mortality and claim specific settlement and loss mitigation strategies, etc., using the following:\n",
      "• Claim by claim reviews, often facilitated by third party specialists, to determine the stability and likelihood of settling an injured worker’s indemnity and medical benefits;\n",
      "• Analysis of the potential for future deterioration in medical condition unlikely to be picked up by a claim file review and associated with potentially costly medical procedures (i.e., increases in both utilization and intensity of medical care) over the course of the injured worker’s lifetime;\n",
      "• Analysis of the cost of medical price inflation for each category of medical spend (services and devices) and for cost of living adjustments in line with statutory requirements;\n",
      "• Portfolio specific mortality level and mortality improvement assumptions based on a mortality study conducted for our primary and excess workers’ compensation portfolios and our opinion of future longevity trends for the open reported cases;\n",
      "• Ground-up consideration of the reinsurance recoveries expected for the product line of business for reported claims with extrapolation for unreported claims; and\n",

      "In recent years, we have expanded our analysis of structural drivers to additional product lines of business as a means of corroborating our judgments using traditional actuarial techniques. For example, we have explicitly used external estimates of future medical inflation and mortality in estimating the loss development tail for excess of deductible primary workers’ compensation business. Using external forecasts for items such as these can improve the accuracy and stability of our estimates.\n",
      "The estimation of liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental pollution losses on insurance policies written many years ago is typically subject to greater uncertainty than other types of losses. This is due to inconsistent court decisions, as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies or have expanded theories of liability. In addition, reinsurance recoverable balances relating to asbestos and environmental loss reserves are subject to greater uncertainty due to the underlying age of the claim, underlying legal issues surrounding the nature of the coverage, and determination of proper policy period. For these reasons, these balances tend to be subject to increased levels of disputes and legal collection activity when actually billed. The insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures.\n",
      "We continue to receive claims asserting injuries and damages from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged claims to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites, referred to collectively as environmental claims, and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. The vast majority of these asbestos and environmental losses emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained absolute exclusions for pollution-related damage and asbestos. The current environmental policies that we specifically price and underwrite for environmental risks on a claims-made basis have been excluded from the analysis.\n",
      "The majority of our exposures for asbestos and environmental losses are related to excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. The litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity amounts, with litigation expenses included within the limits of the liability we incur. Individual significant loss reserves, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case-by-case basis.\n",

      "Compensation\n",
      "We generally use a combination of loss development and expected loss ratio methods for U.S. Workers’ Compensation as this line of business is long-tail.\n",
      "The loss cost trend assumption is not believed to be material with respect to our guaranteed cost loss reserves. This is primarily because our actuaries are generally able to use loss development projections for all but the most recent accident year’s reserves, so there is limited need to rely on loss cost trend assumptions for primary workers’ compensation business.\n",
      "The tail factor is typically the most critical assumption, and small changes in the selected tail factor can have a material effect on our carried reserves. For example, the tail factors beyond twenty years for guaranteed cost business could vary by one and one-half percent below to two percent above those actually indicated in the 2017 loss reserve review. For excess of deductible business, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that tail factors beyond twenty years could vary by four percent below to six percent above those actually indicated in the 2017 loss reserve review.\n",

      "Business or Category\n",
      "Key Assumptions\n",
      "U.S. Excess Casualty\n",
      "We utilize various loss cost trend assumptions for different segments of the portfolio. After evaluating the historical loss cost trends from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss cost trends applicable to the year-end 2017 loss reserve review for U.S. Excess Casualty may range five percent lower or higher than this estimated loss trend. The loss cost trend assumption is critical for the U.S. Excess Casualty class of business due to the long-tail nature of the losses, and is applied across many accident years. Thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years (the expected loss ratio years) to be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends that were initially relied upon in setting the loss reserves. These changes in loss trends could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.\n",
      "U.S. Excess Casualty is a long-tail class of business and any deviation in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. Mass tort claims in particular may develop over a very extended period and impact multiple accident years, so we usually select a separate pattern for them. Thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years to be significantly affected by changes in loss development factors that were initially relied upon in setting the reserves.\n",
      "After evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the actual loss development factors could vary by an amount equivalent to a six month shift from those actually utilized in the year-end 2017 reserve review. This would impact projections both for accident years where the selections were directly based on loss development methods as well as the a priori loss ratio assumptions for accident years with selections based on Bornhuetter-Ferguson or Cape Cod methods. Similar to loss cost trends, these changes in loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.\n",
      "U.S. Other Casualty\n",
      "The key uncertainties for other casualty lines are similar to excess casualty, as the underlying business is long-tailed and can be subject to variability in loss cost trends and changes in loss development factors. These may differ significantly by line of business as coverages such as general liability, medical malpractice and environmental may be subject to different risk drivers.\n",
      "U.S. Financial Lines\n",
      "The loss cost trends for U.S. D&O business vary by year and subset, but for the most recent accident years, it is assumed to have been generally close to zero. After evaluating the historical loss cost levels from prior accident years since the early 1990s, including the potential effect of losses relating to the credit crisis, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the actual variation in loss cost levels for these subsets could vary by approximately 10 percent lower or higher on a year-over-year basis than the assumptions actually utilized in the year-end 2017 reserve review. Because U.S. D&O business has exhibited highly volatile loss trends from one accident year to the next, there is the possibility of an exceptionally high deviation. In our analysis, the effects of loss cost trend assumptions affect the results through the a priori loss ratio assumptions used for the Bornhuetter-Ferguson and Cape Cod methods, which impact the projections for the more recent accident years.\n",
      "The selected loss development factors are also an important assumption, but are less critical than for U.S. Excess Casualty. Because these classes are written on a claims made basis, the loss reporting and development tail is much shorter than for U.S. Excess Casualty. However, the high severity nature of the losses does create the potential for significant deviations in loss development patterns from one year to the next. Similar to U.S. Excess Casualty, after evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss development factors could change by an amount equivalent to a shift by six months from those actually utilized in the year-end 2017 reserve review.\n",
      "Europe Casualty and Financial Lines\n",
      "Similar to U.S. business, European Casualty and Financial Lines can be significantly impacted by loss cost trends and changes in loss development factors. The variation in such factors can differ significantly by product and region.\n",
      "U.S. Property and Special Risks, and Europe Property and Special Risks\n",
      "For short-tail lines such as Property and Special Risks, variance in outcomes for individual large claims or events can have a significant impact on results. These outcomes generally relate to unique characteristics of events such as catastrophes or losses with significant business interruption claims.\n",

      "Personal Insurance is short-tailed in nature similar to Property and Special Risks but less volatile. Variance in estimates can result from unique events such as catastrophes.

      "U.S. Run-off Long Tail Insurance lines\n",
      "We historically have used a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for excess workers’ compensation and other run-off segments. For environmental claims, we have utilized a variety of methods including traditional loss development approaches, claim department and other expert evaluations of the ultimate costs for certain claims and survival ratio metrics.\n",
      "U.S. Run-off Long Tail Insurance lines is an extremely long-tail class of business, with a much greater than normal uncertainty as to the appropriate loss development factors for the tail of the loss development. Specifically for excess workers’ compensation, after evaluating the historical loss development factors for prior accident years since the 1980s as well as the development over the past several years of the ground up loss projections utilized to help select the loss development factors in the tail for this class of business, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the tail factor beyond 30 years could vary by 10 percent above or below that actually indicated in the 2017 loss reserve review.\n",
      "Other Reserve Items\n",
      "Loss adjustment expenses (LAE) are separated into two broad categories, allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE), also referred to as legal defense and cost containment or “legal” and unallocated loss adjustment expenses (ULAE), which includes certain claims adjuster fees and other internal claim management costs.\n",
      "We determine reserves for legal expenses for each class of business by one or more actuarial or structural driver methods. For the majority of segments, legal costs are analyzed in conjunction with losses. For segments where they are separately analyzed the methods used generally include development methods comparable to those described for loss development methods. The development could be based on either the paid loss adjustment expenses or the ratio of paid loss adjustment expenses to paid losses, or both. Other methods include the utilization of expected ultimate ratios of paid loss expense to paid losses, based on actual experience from prior accident years or from similar product lines of business.\n",
      "The bulk of adjuster expenses are allocated and charged to individual claim files. For these expenses, we generally determine reserves based on calendar year ratios of adjuster expenses paid to losses paid for the particular product line of business. For other internal claim costs, which generally relate to specific claim department expenses that are not allocated to individual claim files such as technology costs and other broad initiatives, we look at historic and expected expenditures for these items and project these into the future.\n",
      "The incidence of LAE is directly related to the frequency, complexity and level of underlying claims. As a result, a key driver of variability in LAE is the variability in the overall claims, particularly for long tail lines.\n",
      "The following sensitivity analysis table summarizes the effect on the loss reserve position of using certain alternative loss cost trend (for accident years where we use expected loss ratio methods) or loss development factor assumptions rather than the assumptions actually used in determining our estimates in the year-end loss reserve analyses in 2017:\n",

      "Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health Insurance Contracts\n",
      "Long-duration traditional products include whole life insurance, term life insurance, accident and health insurance, long-term care insurance, and certain payout annuities for which the payment period is life-contingent, which include certain of our single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements.\n",
      "For long-duration traditional business, a “lock-in” principle applies. The assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. The assumptions include mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses, and investment returns. These assumptions are typically consistent with pricing inputs. The assumptions also include margins for adverse deviation, principally for key assumptions such as mortality and interest rates used to discount cash flows, to reflect uncertainty given that actual experience might deviate from these assumptions. Establishing margins at contract inception requires management judgment. The extent of the margin for adverse deviation may vary depending on the uncertainty of the cash flows, which is affected by the volatility of the business and the extent of our experience with the product.\n",
      "Loss recognition occurs if observed changes in actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses under loss recognition testing. To determine whether loss recognition exists, we determine whether a future loss is expected based on updated current assumptions. If loss recognition exists, we recognize the loss by first reducing DAC through amortization expense, and, if DAC is depleted, record additional liabilities through a charge to policyholder benefit expense. Because of the long-term nature of many of our liabilities subject to the “lock-in” principle, small changes in certain assumptions may cause large changes in the degree of reserve adequacy. In particular, changes in estimates of future invested asset returns have a large effect on the degree of reserve deficiency.\n",
      "For additional information on loss recognition see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "Groupings for loss recognition testing are consistent with our manner of acquiring, servicing, and measuring the profitability of the business and are applied by product groupings, including traditional life, payout annuities and long-term care insurance. Once loss recognition has been recorded for a block of business, the old assumption set is replaced and the assumption set used for the loss recognition would then be subject to the lock-in principle. Key judgments made in loss recognition testing include the following:\n",
      "• To determine investment returns used in loss recognition tests, we typically match liabilities with assets of comparable duration, to the extent practicable, and then project future cash flows on those assets. Assets supporting insurance liabilities are primarily comprised of a diversified portfolio of high to medium quality fixed maturity securities, and may also include, to a lesser extent, alternative investments. Our projections include a reasonable allowance for investment expenses and expected credit losses over the projection horizon. A critical assumption in the projection of expected investment income is the assumed net rate of investment return at which excess cash flows are to be reinvested. For products in which asset and liability durations are matched relatively well, this is less of a consideration since interest on excess cash flows are not a significant component of future cash flows. For the reinvestment rate assumption, anticipated future changes to the yield curves could have a large effect. Given the interest rate environment applicable at the date of our most recent loss recognition tests, we assumed a modest and gradual increase in long-term interest rates over time.\n",
      "• For mortality assumptions, key judgments include the extent of industry versus own experience to base future assumptions as well as the extent of expected mortality improvements in the future. The latter judgment is based on a combination of historical mortality trends and advice from industry, public health and demography specialists that were consulted by AIG’s actuaries and published industry information.\n",
      "• For surrender rates, a key judgment involves the correlation between expected increases/decreases in interest rates and increases/decreases in surrender rates. To support this judgment, we compare crediting rates on our products to expected rates on competing products under different interest rate scenarios.\n",
      "• For in-force long-term care insurance, rate increases are allowed but must be approved by state insurance regulators. Consequently, the extent of rate increases that may be assumed requires judgment. In establishing our assumption for rate increases for long-term care insurance, we consider historical experience as to the frequency and level of rate increases approved by state regulators.\n",

      "Significant unrealized appreciation on investments in a low interest rate environment may cause DAC to be adjusted and additional future policy benefit liabilities to be recorded through a charge directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (“shadow loss recognition”). These charges are included, net of tax, with the change in net unrealized appreciation of investments. In applying shadow loss recognition, the Company overlays unrealized gains onto loss recognition tests without revising the underlying test. Accordingly, there is limited additional judgment in this process.\n",

      "Guaranteed Benefit Features of Variable Annuity Products\n",
      "Variable annuity products offered by our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement product lines offer guaranteed benefit features. These guaranteed features include guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) that are payable in the event of death or other instances, and living benefits that are payable in the event of annuitization, or, in other instances, at specified dates during the accumulation period. Living benefits primarily include guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB).\n",
      "For additional information on these features see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "The liability for GMDB, which is recorded in Future policyholder benefits, represents the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account value, with the excess recognized ratably through Policyholder benefits and losses incurred over the accumulation period based on total expected fee assessments. The liabilities for GMWB, which are recorded in Policyholder contract deposits, are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value of the liabilities recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses).\n",
      "Our exposure to the guaranteed amounts is equal to the amount by which the contract holder’s account balance is below the amount provided by the guaranteed feature. A variable annuity contract may include more than one type of guaranteed benefit feature; for example, it may have both a GMDB and a GMWB. However, a policyholder can generally only receive payout from one guaranteed feature on a contract containing a death benefit and a living benefit, i.e., the features are generally mutually exclusive (except a surviving spouse who has a rider to potentially collect both a GMDB upon their spouse’s death and a GMWB during his or her lifetime). A policyholder cannot purchase more than one living benefit on one contract. Declines in the equity markets, increased volatility and a sustained low interest rate environment increase our exposure to potential benefits under the guaranteed features, leading to an increase in the liabilities for those benefits.\n",

      "Policy acquisition costs and policy issuance costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal of existing insurance contracts related to universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) are generally deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the expected lives of the contracts, except in instances where significant negative gross profits are expected in one or more periods. Estimated gross profits include net investment income and spreads, net realized capital gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses, and mortality gains and losses. In estimating future gross profits, lapse assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on DAC amortization. For fixed deferred annuity contracts, the future spread between investment income and interest credited to policyholders is a significant judgment, particularly in a low interest rate environment.\n",
      "If the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC and related reserves, including VOBA, SIA, guaranteed benefit reserves and unearned revenue reserve (URR), are recalculated using the new assumptions, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. Updating such assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.\n",

In determining the asset growth rate, the effect of short-term fluctuations in the equity markets is partially mitigated through the use of a reversion to the mean methodology, whereby short-term asset growth above or below the long-term annual rate assumption impacts the growth assumption applied to the five-year period subsequent to the current balance sheet date.

      "We assess the collectability of reinsurance recoverable balances through either detailed reviews of the underlying nature of the reinsurance balance or comparisons with historical trends of disputes and credit events. We record adjustments to reflect the results of these assessments through an allowance for uncollectable reinsurance that reduces the carrying amount of reinsurance assets on the balance sheet. This estimate requires significant judgment for which key considerations include:\n",
      "• paid and unpaid amounts recoverable;\n",
      "• whether the balance is in dispute or subject to legal collection;\n",
      "• whether the reinsurer is financially troubled (i.e., liquidated, insolvent, in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction); and\n",
      "• whether collateral and collateral arrangements exist.\n",

Determining a reasonable estimate of the amount of such losses requires significant management judgment. In many cases, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases that are in the early stages of litigation or in which claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, we often cannot predict the outcome or estimate the eventual loss or range of reasonably possible losses related to such matters. Given the inherent unpredictability of such matters, the outcome of certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n",

The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed.\n",

FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (FIN 48) now incorporated into Accounting Standards Codification, 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740) prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of an income tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The standard also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties and additional disclosures. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, based on technical merits, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recognized in the financial statements. A tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement.\n",

Additionally, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 addresses situations where accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act under ASC 740 may be incomplete upon issuance of an entity’s financial statements and provides a one-year measurement period from the enactment date to complete the accounting under ASC 740. As of December 31, 2017, we had not fully completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. Our provision for income taxes for the periods ended December 31, 2017, is based in part on a reasonable estimate of the effects on existing deferred tax balances and of certain provisions of the Tax Act.\n",

We continued to operate under difficult market conditions in 2017, characterized by factors such as historically low interest rates, the Department of Labor’s (the DOL) final fiduciary duty rule (the DOL Fiduciary Rule), historically high levels of catastrophic events, slowing growth in China and Euro-Zone economies, and the formal commencement of the UK’s withdrawal from its membership in the European Union (the EU) (commonly referred to as Brexit). Brexit has also affected the U.S. dollar/British pound exchange rate and increased the volatility of exchange rates among the euro, British pound and the Japanese yen (the Major Currencies), which may continue for some time.\n",
      "Impact of Changes in the Interest Rate Environment\n",
      "Interest rates have remained at historically low levels throughout 2017. Certain markets in which we operate have experienced negative interest rates. A sustained low interest rate environment negatively affects sales of interest rate sensitive products in our industry and may negatively impact the profitability of our existing business as we reinvest cash flows from investments, including increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolios. We actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through portfolio selection and asset-liability management, including spread management strategies for our investment-oriented products and economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable and fixed index annuities.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Executive Summary\n",
      "Annuity Sales and Surrenders\n",
      "The sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry. Low long-term interest rates put pressure on investment returns, which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products. However, our disciplined rate setting has helped to mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. As long as the low interest rate environment continues, conditions will be challenging for the fixed annuity market. Rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased sales, but may also drive higher surrenders. Customers are, however, currently buying fixed annuities with surrender charge periods of four to seven years in pursuit of higher returns, which may help mitigate the rate of increase in surrenders in a rapidly rising rate environment. In addition, older contracts that have higher minimum interest rates and continue to be attractive to the contract holders have driven better than expected persistency in Fixed Annuities, although the reserves for such contracts have continued to decrease over time in amount and as a percentage of the total annuity portfolio. We will closely monitor surrenders of Fixed Annuities as contracts with lower minimum interest rates come out of the surrender charge period in a more attractive rate environment. Low interest rates have also driven growth in our fixed index annuity products, which provide additional interest crediting tied to favorable performance in certain equity market indices and the availability of guaranteed living benefits. Changes in interest rates significantly impact the valuation of our liabilities for guaranteed products with income features and the value of the related hedging portfolio.\n",
      "Reinvestment and Spread Management\n",
      "We actively monitor fixed income markets, including the level of interest rates, credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve. We also frequently review our interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for new and in-force business. Business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a historically low interest rate environment. The low interest rate environment makes it more difficult to profitably price many of our products and puts margin pressure on existing products, due to the challenge of investing recurring premiums and deposits and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows in the low interest rate environment while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity. In addition, there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain in-force business. Specifically, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities.\n",
      "The contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in products may reduce spreads in a sustained low interest rate environment and thus reduce future profitability. Although this interest rate risk is partially mitigated through the asset-liability management process, product design elements and crediting rate strategies, a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability.\n",
      "For additional information on our investment and asset-liability management strategies see Investments.\n",
      "For investment-oriented products in our Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance and Institutional Markets businesses, our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business, modifying or limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads, using asset-liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable, and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. Renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals in accordance with state and federal laws and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. We will continue to adjust crediting rates on in-force business to mitigate the pressure on spreads from declining base yields, but our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by the competitive environment, contractual minimum crediting rates, and provisions that allow rates to be reset only at pre-established intervals.\n",
      "Of the aggregate fixed account values of our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement annuity products, 73 percent were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at December 31, 2017. The percentage of fixed account values of our annuity products that are currently crediting at rates above one percent was 69 percent and 70 percent at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These businesses continue to focus on pricing discipline and strategies to reduce the minimum guaranteed interest crediting rates offered on new sales. In the core universal life business in our Life Insurance business, 71 percent of the account values were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at December 31, 2017.\n",

      "Spreads and surrender rates are important components of the future profit assumptions that drive the rate we use to amortize DAC and related reserves for investment-oriented products. If future profit assumptions change significantly, we may be required to recalculate DAC and related reserves, and reflect any resulting adjustments in current period income. In addition to investment-oriented products, certain traditional long-duration products for which we do not have the ability to adjust interest rates, such as payout annuities, are exposed to reduced earnings and potential loss recognition reserve increases in a sustained low interest rate environment.\n",

      "General Insurance\n",
      "The impact of low interest rates on our General Insurance segment is primarily on our long-tail Casualty line of business. We expect limited impacts on our existing long-tail Casualty business as the duration of our assets is slightly longer than that of our liabilities. We do expect sustained low interest rates will impact new and renewal business for the long-tail Casualty line as we may not be able to adjust our future pricing consistent with our profitability objectives to fully offset the impact of investing at lower rates. However, we will continue to maintain pricing discipline and risk selection.\n",
      "In addition, for our General Insurance segment and General Insurance run-off lines reported within the Legacy Portfolio, sustained low interest rates may unfavorably affect the net loss reserve discount for workers’ compensation, and to a lesser extent could favorably impact assumptions about future medical costs, the combined net effect of which could result in higher net loss reserves.\n",

      "Our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement operating segments provide products and services that are subject to restrictions imposed by the ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, including the requirements of the DOL Fiduciary Rule, related exemption amendments, and subsequent interpretative guidance and bulletins. Overall, the DOL Fiduciary Rule, as currently promulgated, would result in increased compliance costs and may create increased exposure to legal claims under certain circumstances, including class actions. Following the extension of the applicability dates of the DOL Fiduciary Rule and related exemptions announced by the DOL in April 2017, the new definition of fiduciary and the impartial conduct standards under the DOL Fiduciary Rule became applicable on June 9, 2017, with the remaining provisions of the rule scheduled to become applicable on January 1, 2018. On November 29, 2017, the DOL finalized an 18-month delay of the elements of the rule that have not yet taken effect.\n",
      "Uncertainty in the annuity market around the implementation of the DOL Fiduciary Rule has negatively impacted industry sales of annuity products, including those offered by Individual Retirement as reflected in declines of premiums and deposits and net flows in our variable annuity product line during the 12-month period ended December 31, 2017. Despite these effects, we believe our diverse complement of annuity product offerings position Individual Retirement and Group Retirement to effectively compete in this evolving retirement market environment.\n",
      "In addition to the DOL reexamining the Fiduciary Rule, the Securities and Exchange Commission and state insurance regulators are also engaged in efforts to evaluate standards of conduct for investment advice, and to impose fiduciary duties on financial advisers who give investment advice. These regulatory initiatives may also create additional uncertainties in the annuity marketplace that could affect our distribution partners and the industry sales of annuity products. While we cannot yet predict what impact these developments will have on our businesses, we are closely following the ongoing review and assessment of the DOL Fiduciary Rule as well as these other federal and state-level developments.\n",
      "Impact of Currency Volatility\n",
      "Currency volatility remains acute. Such volatility affected line item components of income for those businesses with substantial international operations. In particular, growth trends in net premiums written reported in U.S. dollars can differ significantly from those measured in original currencies. The net effect on underwriting results, however, is significantly mitigated, as both revenues and expenses are similarly affected.\n",
      "These currencies may continue to fluctuate, in either direction, especially as a result of the UK’s announced exit from the EU, and such fluctuations will affect net premiums written growth trends reported in U.S. dollars, as well as financial statement line item comparability.\n",

      "U.S. Tax Reform Overview\n",
      "On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted Public Law 115-97, known informally as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Tax Act reduces the statutory rate of U.S. federal corporate income tax to 21 percent and enacts numerous other changes impacting AIG and the insurance industry.\n",
      "Changes specific to the insurance industry include the calculation of insurance tax reserves and related transition adjustments, amortization of specified policy acquisition expenses, treatment of separate account dividends received deductions, and computation of pro-ration adjustments. Provisions of the Tax Act with broader application include reductions or elimination of deductions for certain items, e.g., reductions to corporate dividends received deductions, disallowance of entertainment expenses, and limitations on the deduction of certain executive compensation costs. These provisions, generally, will result in an increase in AIG’s taxable income in the years beginning after December 31, 2017.\n",
      "Consistent with current income tax accounting requirements, we have remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities with reference to the statutory income tax rate of 21 percent and taking into consideration other provisions of the Tax Act. As of December 31, 2017, we had not fully completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. Our provision for income taxes for the period ended December 31, 2017, is based in part on a reasonable estimate of the effects on existing deferred tax balances and of certain provisions of the Tax Act. To the extent a reasonable estimate of the impact of certain provisions was determinable, we recorded provisional estimates as a component of our provision for income taxes on continuing operations. To the extent a reasonable estimate of the impact of certain provisions was not determinable, we have not recorded any adjustments and have continued accounting for them in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of the tax laws in effect before enactment of the Tax Act. Please refer to Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about these provisions.\n",
      "66 AIG | 2017 Form 10-K\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Consolidated Results of Operations\n",
      "The Tax Act includes provisions for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) under which taxes on foreign income are imposed on the excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of certain foreign subsidiaries and for Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) under which taxes are imposed on certain base eroding payments to affiliated foreign companies. Consistent with accounting guidance, we will treat BEAT as an in period tax charge when incurred in future periods for which no deferred taxes need to be provided and have made an accounting policy election to treat GILTI taxes in a similar manner. Accordingly, no provision for income taxes related to GILTI or BEAT was recorded as of December 31, 2017.\n",
      "For the period ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a provisional estimate of income tax effects of the Tax Act of $6.7 billion, including a tax charge of $6.7 billion attributable to the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate and tax benefit of $38 million related to the deemed repatriation tax.\n",
      "In our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we made certain assumptions related to the impact of the Tax Act on our future taxable income. Generally, the Tax Act provisions result in an increase in our taxable income and, thus, accelerate utilization of our tax attribute deferred tax asset. Accordingly, we do not currently anticipate that our reliance on provisional estimates would have a material impact on our determination of the realizability of our deferred tax assets.\n",
      "Repatriation Assumptions\n",
      "As a result of the Tax Act, the majority of accumulated foreign earnings that were previously untaxed will become subject to a one-time deemed repatriation tax. Going forward, foreign earnings not taxed as part of the one-time deemed repatriation (or otherwise taxed currently under the GILTI or subpart F regimes) will generally be exempt from U.S. tax upon repatriation. Notwithstanding the changes, U.S. tax on foreign exchange gain or loss and certain non-U.S. withholding taxes will continue to be applicable upon future repatriations of foreign earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we consider our foreign earnings with respect to certain operations in Canada, South Africa, the Far East, Latin America, Bermuda as well as the European, Asia Pacific and Middle East regions to be indefinitely reinvested. These earnings relate to ongoing operations and have been reinvested in active business operations. Deferred taxes have been provided on earnings of non-U.S. affiliates whose earnings are not indefinitely reinvested.\n",
      "Impact of Deemed Repatriation Tax on Liquidity\n",
      "The Tax Act requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax, net of tax credits related to applicable foreign taxes paid, on previously untaxed current and accumulated earnings and profits (E&P) of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. In the determination of the deemed repatriation tax, we reviewed estimated post-1986 E&P of the relevant foreign subsidiaries, and any related non-U.S. income tax paid on such earnings. Based on this analysis, we were able to determine a reasonable estimate and we have recorded a provisional estimated tax benefit of $38 million. This amount is not considered to be material to our liquidity and capital resources.\n",
      "Impact to Effective Tax Rate on Future Consolidated Results of Operations\n",
      "We currently estimate that effective tax rate on future consolidated results of operations would be 21-22 percent, excluding impact of the items that cannot be forecasted. The effective tax rate is anticipated to exceed the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily because we have operations in jurisdictions where statutory income tax rates exceed 21 percent.\n",

Insurance companies compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product pricing, service and terms and conditions. General Insurance seeks to distinguish itself in the insurance industry primarily based on its well-established brand, global franchise, multinational capabilities, financial and capital strength, innovative products, claims expertise to handle complex claims, expertise in providing specialized coverages and customer service.\n",
      "We serve our business and individual customers on a global basis - from the largest multinational corporations to local businesses and individuals. Our clients benefit from our substantial underwriting expertise.\n",

      "Commercial Lines continues to face challenging market conditions, with excess capacity negatively impacting the rate environment and suppressing margins. However, we continue to achieve positive rate increases across a number of lines and sub-segments as a result of our disciplined underwriting strategy and focus on risk selection. We continue to observe higher loss cost trends in Casualty, in particular Excess Casualty. We anticipate a positive impact on market pricing for Property following recent catastrophe activity, and observed progressive rate improvements throughout the fourth quarter of 2017. The more profitable segments of Commercial Lines remain highly competitive; however, we continue to achieve growth in several of our high margin businesses.\n",
      "Personal Insurance growth prospects are supported by the need for full life cycle products and coverage, increases in personal wealth accumulation, and awareness of insurance protection and risk management. We compete in the high net worth market, accident and health insurance, travel insurance, and warranty services and will continue to expand our innovative products and services to distribution partners and clients.\n",
      "General Insurance - International\n",
      "We believe our global presence provides Commercial Lines and Personal Insurance a distinct competitive advantage, as the demand for multinational cross-border coverage and services increase due to the internationalization of customers.\n",
      "The Commercial Lines market continues to be highly competitive, with increased pressure on rates, particularly in Europe and the Asia Pacific region, due to increased market capacity. Despite this, we are continuing to grow our most profitable segments across all regions and are maintaining market leadership in key developed markets. We are actively remediating our underperforming segments, maintaining our underwriting discipline and continuing our risk selection strategy to maintain profitability.\n",
      "Personal Insurance focuses on individual customers, as well as group and corporate clients. Although market competition within Personal Insurance has increased, we continue to benefit from the underwriting quality, portfolio diversity, and low volatility of the short-tailed risk in the business. We expect our newly formed entity in Japan - AIG Sonpo - to provide the necessary scale and platform to compete more efficiently in the Japanese market. Outside of Japan, Personal Insurance continues to invest selectively in international markets, which we believe have higher potential for sustainable profitability.\n",

Competition is primarily based on product pricing and design, distribution, financial strength, customer service and ease of doing business.\n",
      "Our business remains competitive due to its long-standing market leading positions, innovative products, distribution relationships across multiple channels, customer-focused service and strong financial ratings.\n",
      "Our primary challenges include:\n",
      "• a sustained low interest rate environment, which makes it difficult to profitably price new products and puts margin pressure on existing business due to lower reinvestment yields;\n",
      "• increased competition in our primary markets, including aggressive pricing of annuities by private equity-backed annuity writers, increased competition and consolidation of employer groups in the group retirement planning market, and peers with lower profitability targets in the pension funding space;\n",
      "• increasingly complex new and proposed regulatory requirements, which have created uncertainty that is affecting industry growth; and\n",
      "• investments to upgrade our technology and underwriting processes challenge our management of general operating expenses.\n",
      "OUTLOOK-INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC FACTORS\n",
      "Below is a discussion of the industry and economic factors impacting our specific operating segments:\n",
      "Individual Retirement\n",
      "Increasing life expectancy and reduced expectations for traditional retirement income from defined benefit programs and fixed income securities are leading Americans to seek additional financial security as they approach retirement. The strong demand for individual variable and fixed index annuities with guaranteed income features has attracted increased competition in this product space. In response to the continued low interest rate environment, which has added pressure to profit margins, we have developed guaranteed income benefits for both variable and fixed index annuities with margins that are less sensitive to the level of interest rates.\n",
      "Changes in the interest rate environment can have a significant impact on sales, surrender rates, investment returns, guaranteed income features, and spreads in the annuity industry.\n",
      "Individual Retirement provides products and services that are subject to the requirements of the DOL Fiduciary Rule.\n",
      "Group Retirement\n",
      "Group Retirement competes in the defined contribution market under the VALIC brand. VALIC is a leading retirement plan provider in the U.S. for K-12 schools and school districts, higher education, healthcare, government and other not-for-profit institutions. The defined contribution market is a highly efficient and competitive market that requires support for both plan sponsors and individual participants. To meet this challenge, VALIC is investing in a client-focused technology platform to support improved compliance and self-service functionality. VALIC’s service model pairs self-service tools with its career financial advisors who provide individual plan participants with enrollment support and comprehensive financial planning services.\n",
      "Changes in the interest rate environment can have a significant impact on investment returns, guaranteed income features, and spreads, and a moderate impact on sales and surrender rates.\n",
      "Group Retirement provides products and services that are subject to the requirements of the DOL Fiduciary Rule.\n",
      "Life Insurance\n",
      "Consumers have a significant need for life insurance, whether it is used for income replacement for their surviving family, estate planning or wealth transfer. Additionally, consumers use life insurance to provide living benefits in case of chronic, critical or terminal illnesses, as well as to supplement retirement income.\n",
      "AIG | 2017 Form 10-K\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Business Segment Operations | Life and Retirement\n",
      "In response to consumer needs and a sustained low interest rate environment, our Life Insurance product portfolio has been evolving. We will continue to place a strong focus on indexed universal life products and de-emphasize products with long-duration interest rate guarantees.\n",
      "As life insurance ownership remains at historical lows in the United States, efforts to expand the reach and increase the affordability of life insurance are critical. The industry is investing in consumer-centric efforts to reduce traditional barriers to securing life protection by simplifying the sales and service experience. Digitally enabled processes and tools provide a fast, friendly and simple path to life insurance protection.\n",
      "Institutional Markets\n",
      "Institutional Markets serves a variety of needs for corporate clients. Demand is driven by a number of factors including the macroeconomic and regulatory environment. We expect to see continued growth in the pension risk transfer market as corporate plan sponsors look to transfer asset or liability, longevity, administrative and operational risks associated with their defined benefit plans.\n",
      "Changes in interest rate environment can have significant impact on investment returns and net investment spread, as well as reduce the tax efficiency associated with institutional life insurance products, dampening organic growth opportunities. Tax reform may lead to new opportunities in the stable value wrap market.\n",

As a result, deposits were lower in 2017 compared to 2016 and 2015. In 2017, net investment income included higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected and higher returns from alternative investments, partially offset by a reduction in the overall size of the hedge fund portfolio.

Adjusted pre-tax income also included adjustments in each year to update actuarial assumptions, which were net positive adjustments for all years presented.

      "For Individual Retirement, premiums primarily represent amounts received on life-contingent payout annuities. Premiums decreased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to strong annuity sales in 2016 driven by higher equity market volatility, which made immediate annuities more attractive to customers seeking less volatile returns.

For Variable and Index Annuities, the proportion of reserves subject to surrender charges at December 31, 2017 has decreased compared to December 31, 2016 due to normal aging of the business and slower sales, which were due in part to uncertainty around the implementation of the DOL Fiduciary Rule.

Net flows were negative, but improved compared to 2015 due to higher sales.\n",
      "• Variable and Index Annuities net flows were significantly lower due to a decrease in premiums and deposits, primarily due to lower sales of variable annuities, which reflected a strategic decision to scale back living benefits during the period of very low interest rates, as well as an industry-wide slowdown and uncertainty around the effect of the DOL Fiduciary Rule.\n",

The increase in the amount and proportion of Group Retirement annuity reserves that have no surrender charge at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 was primarily due to normal aging of this book of business, withdrawal limitations on certain plan assets and lower than expected surrenders of older contracts with higher minimum interest rates on fixed account balances that have continued to be attractive to the contract holders in the low interest rate environment.\n",

      "Some of our key investment strategies are as follows:\n",
      "• Fixed maturity securities held by the U.S. insurance companies included in General Insurance consist of a mix of instruments that meet our current risk-return, tax, liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectives.\n",
      "• Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by General Insurance companies consist primarily of high-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.\n",
      "• While more of a focus is placed on asset-liability management in Life and Retirement companies, our fundamental strategy across all of our investment portfolios is to optimize the duration characteristics of the assets within a target range based on comparable liability characteristics, to the extent practicable.\n",
      "• AIG Parent, included in Other Operations, actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities. Based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchases publicly traded, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity.\n",

      "Net investment income is attributed to our businesses based on internal models consistent with the nature of the underlying businesses.\n",
      "For General Insurance - North America and International and Legacy General Insurance Run-Off Lines, we estimate investable funds based primarily on loss reserves and unearned premiums. The allocation of net investment income of the General Insurance companies to segments is calculated based on these estimated investable funds, consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities and the required economic capital allocation for each segment.\n",
      "For Life and Retirement - Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance, and Institutional Markets and Legacy Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines, net investment income is attributed based on invested assets from segregated product line portfolios held in our Life and Retirement companies. All invested assets of the Life and Retirement companies in excess of liabilities are allocated based on estimates of required economic capital allocation for each segment.\n",
      "Asset Liability Measurement\n",
      "For the General Insurance companies, the duration of liabilities for long-tail casualty lines is greater than that of other lines. As a result, the investment strategy within the General Insurance companies focuses on growth of surplus and preservation of capital, subject to liability and other business considerations.\n",
      "The General Insurance companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies and also invest in structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans. While invested assets backing reserves of the General Insurance companies are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities, we have continued to allocate a portion of our investment activity into asset classes that offer higher yields, particularly in the domestic operations. In addition, we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset-backed investments for their risk-return attributes, as well as to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates. This asset diversification has maintained stable average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity securities were largely unchanged. We expect to continue to pursue this investment strategy to meet the General Insurance companies’ liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives.\n",
      "In addition, the General Insurance companies seek to enhance returns through selective investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio.\n",
      "Fixed maturity securities of the General Insurance companies’ domestic operations, with an average duration of 3.9 years, are currently comprised of corporate bonds, structured securities, taxable municipal bonds and government and agency bonds as well as tax-exempt securities, which provide attractive risk-adjusted after-tax returns. The majority of these high quality investments are rated A or higher based on composite ratings.\n",
      "Fixed maturity securities held in the General Insurance companies’ foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated A or higher based on composite ratings, with an average duration of 3.6 years.\n",
      "The investment strategy of the Life and Retirement companies is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value, subject to liquidity requirements, capital constraints, diversification requirements, asset-liability management and available investment opportunities.\n",
      "The Life and Retirement companies use asset-liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses. The Life and Retirement companies' fundamental investment strategy is to maintain a diversified, high to medium quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities that, to the extent practicable, complements the characteristics of liabilities, including duration, which is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities, and as a result, certain portfolios are shorter in duration and others are longer in duration. An extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses, which may require us to further extend the duration of the investment portfolio.\n",
      "The Life and Retirement companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans.\n",

      "NAIC Designations of Fixed Maturity Securities\n",
      "The Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the National Association of Insurance Companies (NAIC) evaluates the investments of U.S. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called ‘NAIC Designations.’ In general, NAIC Designations of ‘1’ highest quality, or ‘2’ high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while NAIC Designations of ‘3’ through ‘6’ generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade. The NAIC has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities, including non-agency RMBS and CMBS, which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses to better determine the appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities. These methodologies result in an improved NAIC Designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. The following tables summarize the ratings distribution of U.S. Insurance Companies fixed maturity security portfolio by NAIC Designation, and the distribution by composite AIG credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies.\n",

      "Moody’s Investors’ Service Inc. (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&P Global Inc.

Under this agreement, we ceded to NICO 80 percent of the losses on subject business paid on or after January 1, 2016 in excess of $25 billion of net paid losses, up to an aggregate limit of $25 billion. At NICO’s 80 percent share, NICO’s limit of liability under the contract is $20 billion. The covered losses ceded to NICO were $13.1 billion and the unexpired limit was $6.9 billion at December 31, 2017. We account for this transaction as retroactive reinsurance. We paid total consideration, including interest, of $10.2 billion. The consideration was placed into a collateral trust account as security for NICO’s claim payment obligations, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has provided a parental guarantee to secure the obligations of NICO under the agreement.

Estimated gross profit projections include assumptions for investment-related returns and spreads, product-related fees and expenses, mortality gains and losses, policyholder behavior and other factors. In estimating future gross profits, lapse assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on DAC amortization. If the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC and related reserves (which may include VOBA, SIA, guaranteed benefit reserves and unearned revenue reserves) are recalculated using the new projections, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. Updating such projections may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.\n",

The fair value of these embedded derivatives is based on actuarial assumptions, including policyholder behavior, as well as capital market assumptions.\n",

      "• we reduced our separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption related to equity market performance by 50 basis points to 7.0 percent and increased our reversion to the mean rates (gross of fees) to 3.74 percent for the Variable Annuity product line in Individual Retirement and 3.78 percent for the Variable Annuity product line in Group Retirement; and\n",
      "• we lowered our ultimate projected yields on invested assets by approximately five to 10 basis points. Projected yields are graded from a weighted average net GAAP book yield of existing assets supporting the business based on the value of the asset to a weighted average yield based on the duration of the assets excluding assets that mature during the grading period.

The assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. Loss recognition occurs if observed changes in actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses under loss recognition testing.

      "In 2017, the update of actuarial assumptions resulted in a net negative adjustment of $14 million, primarily due to $13 million of loss recognition expense on long-term care business in the Legacy Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines resulting from model enhancements. In 2016, Legacy Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines recorded $622 million of loss recognition expense on payout annuities. The loss recognition reflected the establishment of additional reserves primarily as a result of mortality experience studies, which indicated increased longevity, particularly on disabled lives on a block of structured settlements underwritten prior to 2010. In 2015, Legacy Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines recorded loss recognition expense of $28 million to increase reserves for certain long-term care business. The loss recognition was primarily a result of lower future premium increase assumptions.\n",

      "Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefits and Hedging Results\n",
      "Our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with GMWB riders that provide guaranteed living benefit features. The liabilities for GMWB are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value. The fair value of the embedded derivatives may fluctuate significantly based on market interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads, market volatility, policyholder behavior and other factors.\n",
      "In addition to risk-mitigating features in our variable annuity product design, we have an economic hedging program designed to manage market risk from GMWB, including exposures to changes in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and volatility. The hedging program utilizes derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts and interest rate swap and swaption contracts, as well as fixed maturity securities with a fair value election.\n",
      "For additional discussion of market risk management related to these product features see Enterprise Risk Management - Insurance Risks - Life and Retirement Companies Key Risks - Variable Annuity Risk Management and Hedging Programs.\n",
      "Differences in Valuation of Embedded Derivatives and Economic Hedge Target\n",
      "The variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents an estimate of the underlying economic risks in our GMWB riders. The economic hedge target differs from the U.S. GAAP valuation of the GMWB embedded derivatives primarily due to the following:\n",
      "• The economic hedge target includes 100 percent of rider fees in present value calculations; the U.S. GAAP valuation reflects only those fees attributed to the embedded derivative such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero;\n",
      "• The economic hedge target uses best estimate actuarial assumptions and excludes explicit risk margins used for U.S. GAAP valuation, such as margins for policyholder behavior, mortality, and volatility; and\n",
      "• The economic hedge target excludes the non-performance or “own credit” risk adjustment used in the U.S. GAAP valuation, which reflects a market participant’s view of our claims-paying ability by incorporating an additional spread (the NPA spread) to the swap curve used to discount projected benefit cash flows. Because the discount rate includes the NPA spread and other explicit risk margins, the U.S. GAAP valuation is generally less sensitive to movements in interest rates and other market factors, and to changes from actuarial assumption updates, than the economic hedge target. For more information on our valuation methodology for embedded derivatives within policyholder contract deposits see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "The market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting. In addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program, the Life and Retirement companies have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees. The primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include:\n",
      "• Basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns, which may be either positive or negative;\n",
      "• Realized volatility versus implied volatility;\n",
      "• Actual versus expected changes in the hedge target driven by assumptions not subject to hedging, particularly policyholder behavior; and\n",
      "• Risk exposures that we have elected not to explicitly or fully hedge.\n",

      "Impact on Pre-tax Income (Loss)\n",
      "The impact on our pre-tax income (loss) of the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits and related hedging results includes changes in the fair value of the GMWB embedded derivatives, and changes in the fair value of related derivative hedging instruments, both of which are recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses). Realized capital gains (losses), as well as net investment income from changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities used in the hedging program, are excluded from adjusted pre-tax income of Individual Retirement and Group Retirement.\n",
      "The change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and the change in the value of the hedging portfolio are not expected to be fully offsetting, primarily due to the differences in valuation between the economic hedge target, the U.S. GAAP embedded derivatives and the fair value of the hedging portfolio, as discussed above. When corporate credit spreads widen, the change in the NPA spread generally reduces the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a gain, and when corporate credit spreads narrow or tighten, the change in the NPA spread generally increases the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a loss. In addition to changes driven by credit market-related movements in the NPA spread, the NPA balance also reflects changes in business activity and in the net amount at risk from the underlying guaranteed living benefits.\n",
      "The following table presents the net increase (decrease) to consolidated pre-tax income (loss) from changes in the fair value of the GMWB embedded derivatives and related hedges, excluding related DAC amortization:\n",
      "The net impact on pre-tax income from the GMWB and related hedges in 2017 (excluding related DAC amortization) was primarily driven by losses from actuarial assumption updates to lapse and volatility assumptions, tightening credit spreads on the NPA spread and the impact on the NPA volume of lower expected GMWB payments, driven by higher equity markets. In 2016, the net impact on pre-tax income was primarily driven by the impact of rising interest rates and equity markets late in the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in fair value losses in the hedging portfolio, which were not offset by decreases in the embedded derivative liabilities as the risk margins and other assumptions used in the U.S. GAAP valuation caused the embedded derivatives to be less sensitive to market changes than the related hedge portfolio. In addition, 2016 included losses from actuarial assumption updates due to lapse and mortality assumptions. In 2015, the net impact was primarily driven by increasing NPA spread and volume, which had a positive impact on pre-tax income, partially offset by an increase in embedded derivative liabilities driven by a decline in interest rates and unfavorable equity market performance.\n",
      "The change in the fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding update of actuarial assumptions and NPA, in 2017 was largely offset by the related hedging portfolio. However, in 2016, the change in fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding update of actuarial assumptions and NPA, reflected losses on the hedging portfolio driven by improvements in both interest rates and equity markets late in the fourth quarter of 2016, which were not offset by decreases in embedded derivative liabilities. In 2015, the change in the fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding update of actuarial assumptions and NPA, included losses from equity volatility, primarily in the third quarter of 2015, a decline in interest rates and unfavorable equity market performance.\n",
      "AIG | 2017 Form 10-K 123\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Insurance Reserves\n",
      "Fair value gains or losses in the hedging portfolio are typically not fully offset by increases or decreases in liabilities on a U.S. GAAP basis, due to the NPA and other risk margins used for U.S. GAAP valuation that cause the embedded derivatives to be less sensitive to changes in market rates than the hedge portfolio. On an economic basis, the changes in the fair value of the hedge portfolio were partially offset by the decrease in the economic hedge target, as discussed below.\n",
      "Change in Economic Hedge Target\n",
      "The decrease in the economic hedge target liability in 2017 was primarily due to positive equity markets, partially offset by tighter credit spreads and lower equity volatility. The increase in the economic hedge target liability in 2016 was primarily due to the update of actuarial assumptions offset by reductions from positive equity markets and increases in interest rates, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n",
      "Change in Fair Value of the Hedging Portfolio\n",
      "The changes in the fair value of the economic hedge target and, to a lesser extent, the embedded derivative valuation under U.S. GAAP, were offset in part by the following changes in the fair value of the variable annuity hedging portfolio:\n",
      "• Changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities, primarily corporate bonds for which the fair value option has been elected, are used as a capital-efficient way to economically hedge interest rate and credit spread-related risk. In 2017, the change in the fair value of the corporate bond hedging program reflected gains primarily due to tightening of credit spreads. The net gains in 2016 reflected the impact of credit spreads tightening and decreases in market interest rates in the first nine months of 2016, partially offset by an increase in rates in the fourth quarter of 2016. The net losses in 2015 reflected increases in market interest rates in the first six months of 2015 and credit spreads widening. The change in the fair value of the hedging bonds, which is excluded from the adjusted pre-tax income of the Individual Retirement and Group Retirement segments, is reported in net investment income on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).\n",
      "• Changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative contracts, which included swaps, swaptions and futures, resulted in a small net loss in 2017, which reflected increases in rates in the latter half of 2017, partially offset by the impact of interest rate declines in the first half of 2017. The net losses in 2016 reflected increases in rates in the fourth quarter of 2016, which more than offset the impact of interest rate declines in the first nine months of 2016. The net gains in 2015 reflected decreases in market interest rates in the latter half of 2015, partially offset by the impact of increases in rates in the first half of 2015.\n",
      "• The change in the fair value of equity derivative contracts, which included futures and options, resulted in losses in 2017, 2016 and 2015, which varied based on the relative growth in equity market returns in the respective years.\n",

The five-year reversion to the mean period has met the criteria for adjustment in 2017. As a result, the average gross long-term return measurement start date was reset to December 31, 2011 for Individual Retirement and June 30, 2013 for Group Retirement; the reversion to the mean rates (gross of fees) were increased to 3.74 percent in Individual Retirement and 3.78 percent for Group Retirement. Sustained favorable equity market performance in excess of long-term assumptions could result in additional unlocking in the Individual Retirement or Group Retirement variable annuity product lines in the future, with a positive effect on pre-tax income in the period of the unlocking.\n",
      "In 2016, the long-term annual asset growth assumption was updated from 8.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The five-year reversion to the mean period has not met the criteria for adjustment in 2016 and 2015.\n",

      "DAC and Reserves Related to Unrealized Appreciation of Investments\n",
      "DAC and Reserves for universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) are adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the change in DAC, unearned revenue, and benefit reserves with an offset to Other comprehensive income as if securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (shadow Investment-Oriented Adjustments). Shadow Investment-Oriented Adjustments to DAC and unearned revenue generally move in the opposite direction of the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, reducing the reported DAC and unearned revenue balance when market interest rates decline. Conversely, shadow Investment-Oriented Adjustments to benefit reserves generally move in the same direction as the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, increasing reported future policy benefit liabilities balance when market interest rates decline. Market interest rates decreased in 2017. As a result, the unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity securities held in the Life and Retirement companies that support the businesses at December 31, 2017 increased by $3.4 billion compared to December 31, 2016, which resulted in a decrease in DAC and unearned revenues and an increase in future policy benefit liabilities to reflect the shadow Investment-Oriented Adjustments.\n",
      "Similarly, for long-duration traditional products, significant unrealized appreciation of investments in a sustained low interest rate environment may cause additional future policy benefit liabilities (shadow loss reserves) with an offset to Other comprehensive income to be recorded. At December 31, 2017, future policy benefit liabilities increased to reflect additional shadow loss reserves.\n",

      "Overview\n",
      "Liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet our payment obligations. It is defined as cash and unencumbered assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost. We manage our liquidity prudently through various risk committees, policies and procedures, and a stress testing and liquidity risk framework established by our Treasury group with oversight by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Our liquidity risk framework is designed to manage liquidity at both AIG Parent and its subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six months under a liquidity stress scenario.\n",
      "See Enterprise Risk Management - Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement and Enterprise Risk Management - Liquidity Risk Management below for additional information.\n",
      "Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. Our primary source of ongoing capital generation is derived from the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. We must comply with numerous constraints on our minimum capital positions. These constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy at AIG and the individual businesses and are based on internally-defined risk tolerances, regulatory requirements, rating agency and creditor expectations and business needs. Actual capital levels are monitored on a regular basis, and using ERM’s stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital impact of potential macroeconomic, financial and insurance stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraints of both AIG and our insurance subsidiaries.\n",
      "We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events.\n",
      "Nevertheless, some circumstances may cause our cash or capital needs to exceed projected liquidity or readily deployable capital resources. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash or capital needs and loss of sources of liquidity and capital. In addition, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.\n",
      "Depending on market conditions, regulatory and rating agency considerations and other factors, we may take various liability and capital management actions. Liability management actions may include, but are not limited to, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers. Capital management actions may include, but are not limited to, paying dividends to our shareholders and share and/or warrant repurchases.\n",

AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. Based upon an assessment of funding needs, the liquidity sources can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements or contributed as admitted assets to regulated insurance companies. AIG Parent liquidity is monitored through the use of various internal liquidity risk measures. AIG Parent’s primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from subsidiaries and credit facilities.

Large catastrophes may require us to provide additional support to our affected operations. Downgrades in our credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, which could result in non-renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the subsidiary’s ability to meet its own obligations. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital. Other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include an economic collapse of a nation or region significant to our operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval.\n",
      "On January 20, 2017, certain of our General Insurance companies entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO under which they transferred to NICO 80 percent of reserve risk on substantially all of their U.S. Commercial long-tail exposures for accident years 2015 and prior. Under this agreement, these General Insurance companies ceded to NICO 80 percent of the paid losses on subject business paid on or after January 1, 2016 in excess of $25 billion of net paid losses, up to an aggregate limit of $25 billion. The total consideration paid, including interest, was $10.2 billion.\n",
      "Management believes that because of the size and liquidity of our Life and Retirement companies’ investment portfolios, normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience would not create significant liquidity risk. Furthermore, our Life and Retirement companies’ products contain certain features that mitigate surrender risk, including surrender charges. However, in times of extreme capital markets disruption, liquidity needs could outpace resources. As part of their risk management framework, our Life and Retirement companies continue to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue strategies and programs to improve their liquidity position and facilitate their ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio.\n",

Our U.S. General Insurance companies had outstanding borrowings from the FHLBs in an aggregate amount of approximately $190 million and $733 million at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The outstanding borrowings are being used primarily for interest rate risk management purposes in connection with certain reinsurance arrangements, and the related balances are expected to decline as underlying premiums are collected. Our U.S. Life and Retirement companies had no outstanding borrowings in the form of cash advances from the FHLBs at December 31, 2017, and aggregate borrowings in the form of cash advances of approximately $2 million at December 31, 2016. In addition, $606 million and $429 million were due to the FHLB of Dallas at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, under funding agreements issued by our Institutional Markets business, which were reported in Policyholder contract deposits.\n",

      "Certain of our U.S. Life and Retirement companies have programs, which began in 2012, that lend securities from their investment portfolio to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management. Under these programs, these U.S. Life and Retirement companies lend securities to financial institutions and receive cash as collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. Cash collateral received is invested in short-term investments. Additionally, the aggregate amount of securities that a Life and Retirement company is able to lend under its program at any time is limited to five percent of its general account statutory-basis admitted assets. Our U.S. Life and Retirement companies had $2.9 billion and $2.4 billion of securities subject to these agreements at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and $3.0 billion and $2.5 billion of liabilities to borrowers for collateral received at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\n",
      "AIG generally manages capital between AIG Parent and our insurance companies through internal, Board-approved policies and limits, as well as management standards.

This international holding company structure is part of our ongoing efforts to simplify our organizational structure, and is expected to facilitate the optimization of our international capital strategy from both a regulatory and tax perspective. Through February 8, 2018, substantially all of our international operations have been transferred to AIGIH. We will continue to monitor our international holding company structure in light of regulatory, tax and other developments, to ensure that this strategy continues to be effective.\n",

      "In 2017, our Life and Retirement companies collectively declared a total of $2.4 billion of dividends, return of capital and loan repayments. Of this amount, $1.1 billion was paid in the form of cash, $387 million was paid in the form of fixed maturity securities, and $890 million was retained at an intermediate life insurance holding company to fund tax sharing payments to AIG Parent. The Life and Retirement companies made tax sharing payments to AIG Parent in 2017 totaling $3.3 billion in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities, primarily as a result of the Life Insurance Reinsurance Transactions.

However, our ability to utilize the Facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the Facility. These include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the Facility would restrict our access to the Facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

Although we can provide no assurance regarding whether the non-binding settlements will be finalized, the amount we currently expect to pay based on current proposed settlement terms is approximately $1.3 billion. This amount is net of payments previously made with respect to cross border financing transactions involving matters dating back to 1997 and other matters largely related to the same tax years. There remains uncertainty with regard to whether the settlements in principle will ultimately be approved by the relevant authorities as well as the amount and timing of any potential payments, which are not likely to be made before sometime in 2019.\n",

      "In the event of adverse actions on our long-term debt ratings by the major rating agencies, AIGFP and certain other AIG entities would be required to post additional collateral under some derivative transactions or could experience termination of the transactions.

      "We have an integrated process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm-wide risk appetite. Our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of AIG’s major risk positions. Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM. ERM supports our businesses and management in the embedding of risk management in our key day-to-day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing, monitoring, reporting, and mitigating the risks taken by us and our businesses. Nevertheless, our risk management efforts may not always be successful and material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or financial condition may occur.\n",
      "Risk Governance Structure\n",
      "Our risk governance structure fosters the development and maintenance of a risk and control management culture that encompasses all significant risk categories impacting our lines of business and functions. Accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit. We review our governance and committee structure on a regular basis and make changes as appropriate to continue to effectively manage and govern our risks and risk-taking.\n",
      "Our Board of Directors oversees the management of risk through its Risk and Capital Committee (RCC) and Audit Committee. Those committees regularly interact with other committees of the Board of Directors. Our Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reports to both the RCC and our Chief Executive Officer (CEO).\n",

The GRC is chaired by our CRO. Its membership includes our CEO, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and other senior executives from across our corporate functions and business units. Our CRO reports periodically on behalf of the GRC to both the RCC and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Our CRO is also a member of the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) providing ERM the opportunity to contribute to, review, monitor and consider the impact of changes in strategy.\n",

Its mandate includes overseeing our aggregate credit, market, interest rate, capital, liquidity and model risks, as well as asset-liability management, derivatives activity, and foreign exchange transactions. It provides the primary corporate-level review function for all proposed transactions and business practices that are significant in size, complex in scope, or that present heightened legal, reputational, accounting or regulatory risks.

      "Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement\n",
      "Risk Appetite Framework\n",
      "Our Risk Appetite Framework integrates stakeholder interests, strategic business goals and available financial resources. We balance these by seeking to take measured risks that are expected to generate repeatable, sustainable earnings and create long-term value for our shareholders. The framework includes our risk appetite statement approved by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof and a set of supporting tools, including risk tolerances, risk limits and policies, which we use to manage our risk profile and financial resources.\n",
      "We articulate our aggregate risk-taking by setting risk tolerances and thresholds on capital and liquidity measures. These measures are set at the AIG Parent level as well as the legal entity level and cover consolidated and insurance company capital and liquidity ratios. We must comply with standards for capital adequacy and maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all our obligations as they come due in accordance with our internal capital management and liquidity policies. Our risk tolerances take into consideration regulatory requirements, rating agency expectations, and business needs. The GRC routinely reviews the level of risk taken by the consolidated organization in relation to the established risk tolerances. A consolidated risk report is also presented periodically, as required, to the RCC by our CRO.\n",
      "Risk Limits\n",
      "A key component of our Risk Appetite Framework is having a process in place that establishes and maintains appropriate limits on the material risks identified for our core businesses and facilitates monitoring and meeting of both internal and external stakeholder expectations. Our objectives include:\n",
      "• Establishing risk monitoring, providing early warning indicators, and ensuring timely oversight and enforceability of limits;\n",
      "• Defining a consistent and transparent approach to limits governance; and\n",
      "• Aligning our business activities with our risk appetite statement.\n",
      "To support the monitoring and management of AIG’s and its business units’ material risks, ERM has an established limits framework that employs a three-tiered hierarchy:\n",
      "• Board-level risk tolerances are AIG’s aggregate capital and liquidity limits. They define the minimum level of capital and liquidity that we should maintain. These board-level risk tolerances require RCC approval.\n",
      "• AIG management level limits are risk type specific limits at the AIG consolidated level. These limits are defined and calibrated to constrain our concentration in specific risk types, to protect against taking risks that exceed the amount of overall capital AIG has available, and to protect against excess earnings volatility. These limits are approved by our CRO with consultation from the GRC.\n",
      "• BU and legal entity level limits are set to address key risks identified by ERM for the business unit and legal entities, protect capital and liquidity at legal entities and/or meet legal entity specific requirements of regulators and rating agencies. These limits are defined by the business unit and legal entity risk officers.\n",
      "All limits are reviewed by the FRG, GRC or relevant business unit risk committees on a periodic basis and revisions, if applicable, are approved by those committees.\n",
      "The business units are responsible for measuring and monitoring their risk exposures. ERM is responsible for monitoring compliance with limits and providing regular, timely reporting to our senior management and risk committees. Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner and are documented and escalated in accordance with their level of severity or materiality.\n",
      "Risk Identification and Measurement\n",
      "One tool we use to inform our Risk Appetite Framework is risk identification. We conduct risk identification through a number of processes at the business unit and corporate level focused on capturing our material risks and key areas of focus for follow-up risk management actions. A key initiative is our integrated bottom-up risk identification and assessment process down to the product-line level. These processes are used as a critical input to enhance and develop our analytics for measuring and assessing risks across the organization.\n",
      "We employ various approaches to measure, monitor, and manage risk exposures, including the utilization of a variety of metrics and early warning indicators. We use a proprietary internal capital and stress testing framework to measure our quantifiable risks for both insurance and non-insurance operations.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "The internal capital framework quantifies our aggregate economic risk at a given confidence interval, after taking into account a level of diversification benefits between risk factors and business lines. We leverage the internal capital framework to help inform our consolidated risk consumption and profile as well as risk and capital allocation for our businesses.\n",
      "The stress testing framework measures risk over multiple time horizons and under different levels of stress. We develop a range of stress scenarios based on both internal experience and regulatory guidance. The stress tests are intended to ensure that sufficient resources are available under both idiosyncratic and systemic market stress conditions.\n",
      "The stress testing framework assesses our aggregate exposure to our most significant financial and insurance risks, including the risk in each of our key insurance company subsidiaries in relation to its capital needs under stress, risks inherent in our non-insurance company subsidiaries, and risks to AIG consolidated capital. We use this information to determine the resources needed at the AIG Parent level to support our subsidiaries and capital resources required to maintain consolidated company target capitalization levels.\n",
      "Credit Risk Management\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "Credit risk is defined as the risk that our customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due. Credit risk may also result from a downgrade of a counterparty’s credit ratings or a widening of its credit spreads.\n",
      "We devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures. These exposures may arise from, but are not limited to, fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees, letters of credit, and certain General Insurance businesses.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Our credit risks are managed by teams of credit professionals, subject to ERM oversight and various control processes. Their primary role is to assure appropriate credit risk management in accordance with our credit policies and procedures relative to our credit risk parameters. Our Chief Credit Officer (CCO) and credit executives are primarily responsible for the development, implementation and maintenance of a risk management framework, which includes the following elements related to our credit risks:\n",
      "• developing and implementing our company-wide credit policies and procedures;\n",
      "• approving delegated credit authorities to our credit executives and qualified credit professionals;\n",
      "• developing methodologies for quantification and assessment of credit risks, including the establishment and maintenance of our internal risk rating process;\n",
      "• managing a system of credit and program limits, as well as the approval process for credit transactions, above limit exposures, and concentrations of risk that may exist or be incurred;\n",
      "• evaluating, monitoring, reviewing and reporting of credit risks and concentrations regularly with senior management; and\n",
      "• approving appropriate credit reserves, credit-related other-than-temporary impairments and corresponding methodologies for all credit portfolios.\n",
      "We monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require mitigants, such as third-party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, including commercial bank-issued letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. We treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, and letters of credit as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data. We also monitor closely the quality of any trust collateral accounts.\n",
      "For further information on our credit concentrations and credit exposures see Investments - Available-for-Sale Investments.\n",
      "AIG | 2017 Form 10-K\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "Our credit risk management framework incorporates the following elements:\n",

      "Risk Limits\n",
      "including, but not limited to, a system of single obligor or risk group-based AIG-wide house limits and sub-limits for corporates, financial institutions, sovereigns and sub-sovereigns when appropriate and a defined process for identifying, evaluating, documenting and approving, if appropriate, breaches of and exceptions to such limits\n",

      "Market Risk Management\n",
      "Market risk is defined as the risk of adverse impact due to systemic movements in one or more of the following market risk drivers: equity and commodity prices, residential and commercial real estate values, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange, inflation, and their levels of volatility.\n",
      "We are engaged in a variety of insurance, investment and other financial services businesses that expose us to market risk, directly and indirectly. We are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities, on both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet through on- and off-balance sheet exposures. The Risk Officer within each business is responsible for creating a framework to properly identify these risks, then ensuring that they are appropriately measured, monitored and managed in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the Chief Market Risk Officer (CMRO).\n",
      "The scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner consistent with our risk appetite statement. Our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in these broad market observables, as opposed to the idiosyncratic risks associated with individual assets that are addressed through our credit risk management function.\n",
      "Many of our market risk exposures related to interest rates and equity returns are associated with our Life and Retirement companies and relate to both asset and liability exposures. In addition, these exposures are long-term in nature. Examples of liability-related exposures include interest rate sensitive surrenders in our fixed deferred annuity product portfolio. Also, we have equity market risk sensitive surrenders in our variable annuity product portfolio. These interactive asset-liability types of risk exposures are regularly monitored in accordance with the risk governance framework noted above.\n",
      "AIG | 2017 Form 10-K 143\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "Risk Identification\n",
      "Market risk focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in broad, external, predominantly market-observable risks. Financial repercussions can include an adverse impact on results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital.\n",
      "Each of the following systemic risks is considered a market risk:\n",
      "Equity prices\n",
      "We are exposed to changes in equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments. Changes in equity prices can affect the valuation of publicly traded equity shares, investments in private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other equity-linked capital market instruments as well as equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities, indexed universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance.\n",
      "Residential and commercial real estate values\n",
      "Our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments. Changes in residential/commercial real estate prices can affect the valuation of residential/commercial mortgages, residential/commercial mortgage-backed securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential/commercial mortgages, trusts that include residential/commercial real estate and/or mortgages, residential mortgage insurance and reinsurance contracts and commercial real estate investments.\n",
      "Interest rates\n",
      "Interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities. Lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and make some of our product offerings less attractive to investors. Conversely, higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons. However, when rates rise quickly, there can be a temporary asymmetric GAAP accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income, and the offsetting decrease in the value of related liabilities may not be recognized. Changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, financial liabilities, insurance contracts including but not limited to universal life, fixed rate annuities, variable annuities and derivative contracts.\n",
      "Credit spreads\n",
      "Credit spreads measure an instrument’s risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default-free instrument. Changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including but not limited to corporate bonds, ABS, mortgage-backed securities, AIG-issued debt obligations, credit derivatives and derivative credit valuation adjustments. Much like higher interest rates, wider credit spreads with unchanged default losses mean more investment income in the long term. In the short term, quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income. A precipitous widening of credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the credit worthiness of bond obligors, potentially resulting in default losses.\n",
      "Foreign exchange (FX) rates\n",
      "We are a globally diversified enterprise with income, assets and liabilities denominated in, and capital deployed in, a variety of currencies. Changes in FX rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of balance sheet and income statement items as well as the settlement of cash flows exchanged in specific transactions.\n",
      "Commodity prices\n",
      "Changes in commodity prices (the value of commodities) can affect the valuation of publicly-traded commodities, commodity indices and derivatives on commodities and commodity indices. We are exposed to commodity prices primarily through their impact on the prices and credit quality of commodity producers’ debt and equity securities in our investment portfolio.\n",
      "Inflation\n",
      "Changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including AIG-issued debt obligations, derivatives and other contracts explicitly linked to inflation indices, and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly, via indexing, or implicitly, through medical costs or wage levels.\n",

Market Risk is managed by our finance, treasury and investment management corporate functions, collectively, and in partnership with ERM. The CMRO is primarily responsible for the development and maintenance of a risk management framework that includes the following key components:\n",
      "• written policies that define the rules for our market risk-taking activities and provide clear guidance regarding their execution and management;\n",
      "• a limit framework that aligns with our Board-approved risk appetite statement;\n",

      "Risk Measurement\n",
      "Our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures. At the firm-wide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with AIG’s risk appetite statement. This is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework. Our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital and liquidity levels. At the market risk level, the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change on an economic basis.\n",
      "In addition, we continue to use enhanced economic, GAAP accounting and statutory capital-based risk measures at the market risk level, business-unit level and firm-wide levels. This process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures.\n",
      "We use a number of approaches to measure our market risk exposure, including:\n",
      "Examples include:\n",
      "Sensitivity analysis\n",
      "measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input\n",
      "• a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity securities,\n",
      "• a one basis point increase in credit spreads of fixed maturity securities, and\n",
      "• a one percent increase in prices of equity securities.\n",
      "Scenario analysis\n",
      "uses historical, hypothetical, or forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures\n",
      "• a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, or\n",
      "• a 20 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in world-wide equity markets.\n",
      "Scenarios may also utilize a stochastic framework to arrive at a probability distribution of losses.\n",
      "Stress testing\n",
      "a special form of scenario analysis in which the scenarios are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome\n",
      "• the stock market crash of October 1987 or the widening of yields or spreads of RMBS or CMBS during 2008.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "(a) At December 31, 2017, the analysis covered $276.8 billion of $289.6 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded were $8.2 billion of loans. In addition, $4.6 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations. At December 31, 2016, the analysis covered $276.1 billion of $291.7 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded were $8.1 billion of loans and $2.5 billion of investments in life settlements. In addition, $5.0 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations.\n",
      "(b) At December 31, 2017, the analysis excluded $6.0 billion of long-term debt related to debt of consolidated investments, $642 million of AIGLH borrowings, $190 million of borrowings from the FHLB and $334 million of AIG Japan Holdings loans. At December 31, 2016, the analysis excluded $4.4 billion of long-term debt related to debt of consolidated investments, $642 million of AIGLH borrowings, $735 million of borrowings from the FHLB and $330 million of AIG Japan Holdings loans.\n",
      "(c) The balance sheet exposures for equity contracts and variable annuity and other embedded derivatives are also reflected under “Interest rate sensitive liabilities” above, and are not additive.\n",
      "(d) The majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag.\n",
      "The sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed as predictive of our future financial performance. We cannot ensure that our actual losses in any particular period will not exceed the amounts indicated above.\n",
      "We use duration and convexity metrics to measure price sensitivity to interest rate changes for interest rate sensitive assets excluding derivatives and long-term debt. Duration measures the relative sensitivity of the fair value of a financial instrument to changes in interest rates. Convexity measures the rate of change of duration with respect to changes in interest rates.\n",
      "Interest rate sensitivity of a derivative is calculated as change in its value with respect to plus a 100 basis point change in the interest rate environment, calculated as: scenario value minus base value, where base value is the value of the derivative under the yield curves as of the period end and scenario value is the value reflecting a 100 basis point parallel increase in all yield curves.\n",
      "We evaluate our interest rate risk without the effect of any correlation among other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the fair value of our financial liabilities and embedded derivatives. This scenario does not measure changes in value resulting from non-parallel shifts in the yield curve, which could produce different results.\n",
      "We evaluate our equity price risk without the effect of any correlation among other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the fair value of our financial liabilities and embedded derivatives. This scenario considers the direct impact of declines in equity prices and not changes in asset-based fees, changes in the estimated gross profits used for amortizing DAC, or changes in any other assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the embedded derivatives related to the living benefit features within variable annuity products. In addition, this scenario does not reflect the impact of basis risk, such as projections about the future performance of the underlying contract holder funds and actual fund returns, which we use as a basis for developing our hedging strategy.\n",
      "Foreign currency-denominated net asset position reflects our consolidated non-U.S. dollar assets less our consolidated non-U.S dollar liabilities on a GAAP basis, with certain adjustments. We use a bottom-up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory capital at the regulated insurance entity level. At the AIG Parent level, we monitor our foreign currency exposures against single currency and aggregate currency portfolio limits.\n",
      "Our foreign currency-denominated net asset position at December 31, 2017, decreased by $3.3 billion compared to December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.7 billion decrease in our Japanese yen position primarily due to the sale of Fuji Life and the unwinding of certain yen hedges; a $0.7 billion decrease in our euro position primarily due to the issuance of €1.0 billion euro denominated debt; and a $248 million decrease in our British pound position primarily due to an increase in reserves.\n",
      "For illustrative purposes, we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The estimated results presented in the table above should not be taken as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events.\n",
      "The sensitivity factors utilized for 2017 and presented above were selected based on historical data from 1997 to 2017, as follows (see the table below):\n",
      "• a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve is consistent with a one standard deviation movement of the benchmark ten-year treasury yield;\n",
      "• a 20 percent drop for equity and alternative investments is broadly consistent with a one standard deviation movement in the S&P 500; and\n",
      "• a 10 percent depreciation of foreign currency exchange rates is consistent with a one standard deviation movement in the U.S. dollar (USD)/Japanese yen (JPY) exchange rate.\n",

      "The risk monitoring responsibilities, owned by the business units, include ensuring compliance with market risk limits and escalation and remediation of limit breaches. Such activities must be reported to the ERM Market Risk team by the relevant business unit. This monitoring approach is aligned with our overall risk limits framework.\n",
      "To control our exposure to market risk, we rely on a three-tiered hierarchy of limits that the CMRO closely monitors and reports to our CRO, senior management and risk committees.\n",

      "Liquidity Risk Management\n",
      "Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations. Failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in insolvency, reduced operating flexibility, increased costs, reputational harm and regulatory action.\n",

We maintain liquidity limits and minimum coverage ratios designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions. If we project that we will breach these tolerances, we will assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions.

      "Cash Flow Mismatch Risk\n",
      "Discrete and cumulative cash flow mismatches or gaps over short-term horizons under both expected and adverse business conditions may create future liquidity shortfalls.\n",
      "Event Funding Risk\n",
      "Additional funding may be required as the result of a trigger event. Event funding risk comes in many forms and may result from a downgrade in credit ratings, a market event, or some other event that creates a funding obligation or limits existing funding options.\n",
      "Financing Risk\n",
      "We may be unable to raise additional cash on a secured or unsecured basis due to unfavorable market conditions, AIG-specific issues, or any other issue that impedes access to additional funding.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Liquidity risk is overseen at the corporate level within ERM. The CRO has responsibility for the oversight of the Liquidity Risk Management Framework and delegates the day-to-day implementation of this framework to the AIG Treasurer. Our corporate treasury function manages liquidity risk, subject to ERM oversight and various control processes.\n",
      "The Liquidity Risk Management Framework is guided by the liquidity risk tolerance as set forth in the Board-approved risk appetite statement.

      "Comprehensive cash flow projections under normal conditions are the primary component for identifying and measuring liquidity risk. We produce comprehensive liquidity projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows. In addition, we perform stress testing by identifying liquidity stress scenarios and assessing the effects of these scenarios on our cash flow and liquidity.\n",
      "We use a number of approaches to measure our liquidity risk exposure, including:\n",
      "Minimum Liquidity Limits\n",
      "Minimum Liquidity Limits specify the amount of assets required to be maintained in specific liquidity portfolios to meet obligations as they arise over a specified time horizon under stressed liquidity conditions.\n",
      "Coverage Ratios\n",
      "Coverage Ratios measure the adequacy of available liquidity sources, including the ability to monetize assets to meet the forecasted cash flows over a specified time horizon. The portfolio of assets is selected based on our ability to convert those assets into cash under the assumed market conditions and within the specified time horizon.\n",

      "Overview\n",
      "Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss, or other adverse consequences, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or from external events. Operational risk includes legal, regulatory, and compliance risks, and excludes business and strategy risks.\n",
      "Operational risk is inherent in each of our business units and functions and can have many impacts, including but not limited to: unexpected economic losses or gains, reputational harm due to negative publicity, regulatory action from supervisory agencies and operational and business disruptions, and/or damage to customer relationships.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Our operational risk governance sets the requirements necessary to embed a risk management culture throughout the organization. AIG and its consolidated subsidiaries establish and maintain operational risk and controls governance forums that include representatives from the relevant business units and corporate functions to appropriately manage significant operational risk exposures. At an enterprise level, the TORCC oversees operational risk. The TORCC addresses firm-wide rather than business-specific issues and is mandated to prioritize technology and operational improvements that are significant and transformational.\n",
      "Operational risk is overseen at the corporate level within ERM through the Head of AIG Operational and Technology Controls, who reports directly to our CRO. The Head of AIG Operational and Technology Controls is responsible for the development and maintenance of the operational risk framework that includes policies, standards and deployment of systems.\n",
      "Risk Identification, Measurement and Monitoring\n",
      "The ORM function within ERM oversees the operational risk policy and integrated risk and control framework, which includes risk identification, assessment, measurement, management and monitoring of operational risk exposures. ORM supports the TORCC and has responsibility to provide an aggregate view of our operational risk profile. As part of the framework, we employ a Three Lines of Defense model whereby the first line consists of business units and corporate functions that own and manage AIG risks, the second line consists of ERM and other control functions and serves as an independent advisor to the first line and has risk oversight\n",

A key area of ongoing development is to have business leaders assume ownership and accountability for the risks and controls in their operating units, including support functions, for the operational risks that arise in their own processes and activities. In line with the Three Lines of Defense Model, the ORM programs include, but are not limited to, several key components outlined below:\n",
      "• Risk Event Capture - enables every employee to identify, document, and escalate operational risk events, with a view to enhancing processes and promoting lessons learned.\n",
      "• Risk Assessments - allows for the assessment, measurement and management of the key operational risks within our business units and helps inform on the efficacy of our control environment.\n",
      "• Key Risk Indicators - enhances the ongoing monitoring and mitigation of operational risks and facilitate risk reporting.\n",
      "• Issues Management - enables a consistent tracking of issues across the firm, including policy and process exceptions, control deficiencies and findings from risk and control assessment activities.\n",
      "• Scenario Analyses - executed by first- and second-line professionals to identify potential risks that could result in financial losses in order to identify the financial implications of the risk to the firm and support the prioritization of operational risk treatment.\n",
      "ORM, working together with other control and assurance functions (e.g., Compliance, Financial Controls Unit / Sarbanes Oxley, Global Business Continuity, and Internal Audit) through the integrated risk and control framework, provides an independent view of operational risks for each business, and works with the business unit CRO and business unit OCA to facilitate implementation of the above programs. This includes coverage of operational risks related to core insurance activities, investing, model risk, technology (including cyber security, identify and access management, data privacy and data security), third-party providers, as well as compliance and regulatory matters. Based on the results of the risk identification and assessment efforts above, business leaders are accountable for tracking and remediating identified issues in line with our risk-monitoring procedures. Governance committees support these efforts and promote transparency enabling improved management decision making.\n",
      "An integrated risk and control framework facilitates the identification and mitigation of operational risk issues. To accomplish this, our integrated risk and control framework is designed to:\n",
      "• ensure first line accountability and ownership of risks and controls;\n",
      "• promote role clarity among the business and risk and control functions;\n",
      "• enhance transparency, risk management governance and culture;\n",
      "• foster greater consistency in identifying, measuring and ranking material risks;\n",
      "• proactively address potential risk issues and assign clear ownership and accountability for risk treatment; and\n",
      "• manage the development of technology solutions that support the objectives above.\n",
      "Insurance Risks\n",
      "Insurance risk is defined as risk arising from the uncertainty around the actual experience and/or policyholder behavior being materially different than expected at the inception of an insurance contract. These uncertainties include the amount and timing of cash flows from premiums, commissions, expenses, claims and claim settlement expenses paid or received under a contract.\n",
      "Except as described above, we manage our business risk oversight activities through our insurance operations. A primary goal in managing our insurance operations is to achieve an acceptable risk-adjusted return on equity. To achieve this goal, we must be disciplined in risk selection, premium adequacy, and appropriate terms and conditions to cover the risk accepted.\n",
      "We operate our insurance businesses on a global basis, and we are exposed to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. We manage these risks throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of procedures:\n",

We develop probabilistic estimates of risk based on our exposures, historical observed volatility or industry-recognized models in the case of catastrophe risk.\n",
      "Scenario analysis. Scenario or deterministic analysis is used to measure and monitor risks such as terrorism or to estimate losses due to man-made catastrophic scenarios.\n",
      "In addition, we monitor concentrations of exposure through insurance limits aggregated along dimensions such as geography, industry, or counterparty.\n",
      "The risk monitoring responsibilities of the business units include ensuring compliance with insurance risk limits and escalation and remediation of limit breaches.

      "General Insurance Companies’ Key Risks\n",
      "We manage our risks through risk review and selection processes, exposure limitations, exclusions, deductibles, self-insured retentions, coverage limits, attachment points, and reinsurance. This management is supported by sound underwriting practices, pricing procedures and the use of actuarial analysis to help determine overall adequacy of provisions for insurance. Underwriting practices and pricing procedures incorporate historical experience, changes in underlying exposure, current regulation and judicial decisions as well as proposed or anticipated regulatory changes.\n",
      "For General Insurance companies, risks primarily include the following:\n",
      "• Loss Reserves - The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the General Insurance companies. There is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. We manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. For further information see Critical Accounting Estimates - Insurance Liabilities - Loss Reserves herein.\n",
      "• Underwriting - The potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the General Insurance companies’ ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. This may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, worse than expected prepayment of policies, investment results, or unexpected or increased costs or expenses.\n",
      "• Catastrophe Exposure - Our business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect our operating results. Other risks, such as man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n",
      "• Single Risk Loss Exposure - Our business is exposed to loss events that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. Events such as fires or explosions can result in loss activity for our clients. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by our GRC through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance. Furthermore, single risk loss exposure is managed and monitored on both a segregated and aggregated basis.\n",
      "• Reinsurance - Since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated. The inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n",
      "Natural Catastrophe Risk\n",
      "We manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate Probable Maximum Loss (PML) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.\n",
      "We use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. We apply a proprietary multi-model approach to account for relative strengths and weaknesses of vendor models, and make adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.\n",
      "We perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model weaknesses, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. Lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts that allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.\n",
      "We recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policy to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. For example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. In addition, we are committed to providing innovative insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change, including expanding natural disaster resilience, promoting adaptation, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Our internal product development, underwriting, modeling, and sustainability practices will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "Our natural catastrophe exposure is primarily driven by the U.S. and Japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries. For example, we have exposures to additional perils such as European windstorms and floods and seismic events across the Pacific Rim. Within the U.S., we have significant hurricane exposure in Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, the Northeast U.S. and mid-Atlantic regions. Events impacting the Northeast U.S. and the mid-Atlantic may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in those regions. Within the U.S., we have significant earthquake exposure in California, the Pacific Northwest and New Madrid regions. Earthquakes impacting the Pacific Northwest and New Madrid regions may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in these regions.\n",
      "The estimates below are the Occurrence Exceedance Probability (OEP) losses, which reflect losses that may occur in any single event due to the defined peril. The 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 PMLs are the probable maximum losses from a single natural catastrophe event with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent in a year, respectively.\n",
      "The following table presents an overview of OEP modeled losses for top perils and countries:\n",
      "(a) The U.S. hurricane amount includes losses to Property from hurricane hazards of wind and storm surge.\n",
      "(b) U.S. earthquake loss estimates represent exposure to Property, Workers’ Compensation (U.S.) and A&H business lines.\n",
      "(c) Japan Earthquake represents exposure to Property and A&H business lines.\n",
      "(d) Taxed at statutory rate of 21 percent and 30 percent for the U.S. and Japanese modeled losses, respectively.\n",
      "The OEP estimates provided above reflect our in-force portfolios at September 30, 2017, for both U.S. and Japan exposures. The catastrophe reinsurance program is as of January 1, 2018.\n",
      "AIG, along with other property casualty insurance and reinsurance companies, uses industry-recognized catastrophe models and applies proprietary modeling processes and assumptions to arrive at loss estimates. The use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially change the projected losses. Since there is no industry standard for assumptions and preparation of insured data for use in these models, our modeled losses may not be comparable to estimates made by other companies.\n",
      "Also, the modeled results are based on the assumption that all reinsurers fulfill their obligations to us under the terms of the reinsurance arrangements and all catastrophe bonds attach and pay as modeled. However, reinsurance recoverable may not be fully collectible. In particular, the use of catastrophe bonds may not provide commensurate levels of protection compared to traditional reinsurance transactions. Therefore, these estimates are inherently uncertain and may not accurately reflect our exposure to these events.\n",
      "Our 2018 catastrophe reinsurance program provides protection on both an aggregate and occurrence basis with respect to North American exposures including United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.\n",
      "• Aggregate protection protects us against a high frequency of losses from certain events including windstorm, severe convective storm, earthquake, wildfire, and flood. Under this part of the program, AIG can recover up to $2.75 billion of aggregate losses in excess of $750 million. The event deductible is $100 million initially, but increases to $250 million for individual events greater than $750 million after the $750 million aggregate retention is exhausted. This protection will also cover a large event, providing coverage of up to $2 billion after the aggregate retention of $750 million is exhausted.\n",
      "• Occurrence protection is provided primarily on a $2 billion excess of $2 billion basis, with one reinstatement, with an additional $750 million excess of $4 billion on top of that but with no reinstatement. The $750 million excess of $4 billion layer is shared with the top $750 million layer of aggregate protections, such that, only a total of $750 million of limit is available across those two layers.\n",
      "Additional multi-year coverages purchased in prior years provide additional coverage at various points of the program, including $125 million that is part of $500 million excess of $4.5 billion coverage from the catastrophe bond reinsurance contract we entered into with Tradewynd Re Ltd. in 2014.\n",
      "In addition, we continue to purchase specific covers to protect against catastrophic events in Japan and have also purchased protection against severe losses for other international locations on a global basis.\n",

      "For additional information see also Item 1A. Risk Factors - Reserves and Exposures.\n",
      "Terrorism Risk\n",
      "We actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. We have set risk limits based on modeled losses from certain terrorism attack scenarios. Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model for various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the General Insurance companies’ exposures. Examples of modeled scenarios are conventional bombs of different sizes, anthrax attacks and nuclear attacks.\n",
      "Our largest terrorism exposures are in New York City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers’ Compensation lines of business. At our largest exposure location, modeled losses for a five-ton bomb attack net of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIP) and reinsurance recoveries are estimated to be $2.4 billion as of September 30, 2017.\n",
      "Our exposure to terrorism risk in the U.S. is mitigated by TRIP in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIP covers terrorist attacks within the United States or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law. In 2018, TRIP covers 82 percent of insured losses above a deductible, decreasing by one percent each year to 80 percent in 2020. The current estimate of our deductible is approximately $2.2 billion for 2017.\n",
      "We offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. We also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n",
      "Life and Retirement Companies’ Key Risks\n",
      "We manage risk through product design, experience monitoring, pricing actions, risk limitations, reinsurance and active monitoring and management of the relationships between assets and liabilities, including hedging.\n",
      "For Life and Retirement companies, risks include the following:\n",
      "• Longevity risk - represents the risk of a change in value of a policy or benefit as a result of actual mortality rates being lower than the expected mortality rates. This risk could arise from longer-term societal health changes as well as other factors. This risk exists in a number of our product lines but is most significant for our pension risk transfer, structured settlement, and annuity products.\n",
      "• Morbidity risk - represents the risk arising from actual morbidity (i.e,. illness, disability or disease) incidence being higher than expected or the length of the claims extending longer than expected resulting in a higher overall benefit payout. This risk could arise from longer-term medical advances in detection and treatment for various diseases and medical conditions, as well as other factors. This risk exists in certain product lines such as group benefits, health and long-term care businesses.\n",
      "• Mortality risk - represents the risk of loss arising from actual mortality rates being higher than expected mortality rates. This risk could arise from pandemics or other events, including longer-term societal changes that cause higher-than-expected mortality. This risk exists in a number of our product lines, but is most significant for our life insurance products.\n",
      "• Policyholder behavior risk including full and partial surrender/lapse risk - represents the risk that actual policyholder behavior differs from expected behavior in a manner that has an adverse effect on our operating results. There are many related assumptions made when products are sold, including how long the contracts will persist and other assumptions which impact the expected utilization of contract benefits and features. Actual experience can vary significantly from these assumptions. This risk is impacted by a number of factors including changes in market conditions, especially changes in the levels of interest rate and equity markets, tax law, regulations, competitive landscape and policyholder preferences. This risk exists in the majority of our product lines.\n",
      "The emergence of significant adverse experience compared to the initial assumptions at policy issuance or updated assumption would require an adjustment to DAC and benefit reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for a particular period.\n",
      "For additional discussion of the impact of actual and expected experience on DAC and benefit reserves see Critical Accounting Estimates - Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health Insurance Contracts and Critical Accounting Estimates - Guaranteed Benefit Features of Variable Annuity Products. For additional discussion of business risks see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Business and Operations.\n",

      "Variable Annuity Risk Management and Hedging Programs\n",
      "Our Individual and Group Retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with GMWB riders that guarantee a certain level of benefits. GMWB guaranteed living benefits are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses). GMWB features subject the Life and Retirement companies to market risk, including exposure to changes in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility.\n",
      "Variable annuity product design is the first step in managing our exposure to these market risks. Risk mitigation features of our variable annuity product design include GMWB rider fees indexed to an equity market volatility index, which can provide additional fee assessments in periods of increased market volatility, required minimum allocations to fixed accounts to reduce overall equity exposure, and the utilization of volatility control funds, which reduce equity exposure in the funds in response to changes in market volatility, even under sudden or extreme market movements.\n",
      "After reflecting our product risk-mitigating features, we hedge our remaining economic exposure to market risk within GMWB features through our variable annuity hedging program, which is designed to offset certain changes in the economic value of these GMWB embedded derivatives, within established thresholds. The hedging program is designed to provide additional protection against large and combined movements in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility under multiple scenarios.\n",
      "Our hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents our estimate of the underlying economic risks in our GMWB riders, based on the present value of the future expected benefit payments for the GMWB, less the present value of future rider fees, over numerous stochastic scenarios. This stochastic projection method uses best estimate assumptions for policyholder behavior (including mortality, lapses, withdrawals and benefit utilization) in conjunction with market scenarios calibrated to observable equity and interest rate option prices. Policyholder behaviors are regularly evaluated to compare current assumptions to actual experience and, if appropriate, changes are made to the policyholder behavior assumptions. The risk of changes in policyholder behavior is not explicitly hedged and such differences between expected and actual policyholder behaviors will result in hedge ineffectiveness.\n",
      "Due to differences between the calculation of the economic hedge target and U.S. GAAP valuation of the embedded derivative, which include differences in the treatment of rider fees and exclusion of certain risk margins and other differences in discount rates, we expect relative movements in the economic hedge target and the U.S. GAAP embedded derivative valuation will vary over time with changes in equity markets, interest rates and credit spreads.\n",
      "For information on the impact on our consolidated pre-tax income from the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives and the hedging portfolio, as well as additional discussion of differences between the economic hedge target and the valuation of the embedded derivatives see Insurance Reserves - Life and Annuity Reserves and DAC - Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefits and Hedging Results.\n",
      "In designing our hedging portfolio for our variable annuity hedging program, we make assumptions and projections about the future performance of the underlying contract holder funds. To project future account value changes, we make assumptions about how each of the underlying funds will perform. We map the contract holder funds to a set of publicly traded indices that we believe best represent the liability to be hedged. Basis risk exists due to the variance between these assumptions and actual fund returns, which may result in variances between changes in the hedging portfolio and changes in the economic hedge target. Net hedge results and the cost of hedging are also impacted by differences between realized volatility and implied volatility.\n",
      "For index annuity and universal life products, we have a hedging program designed to manage the index crediting strategies associated with index annuity and index life products. This hedging program is designed to offset the economic risk with respect to the index returns for the current crediting rate reset period, and utilizes derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity index options and futures contracts. Similarly as with the variable annuities, there are differences between the calculation of the economic hedge target and U.S. GAAP valuation of the index annuity and index life embedded derivatives, which can lead to variances in their relative movements.\n",
      "To manage the capital market exposures embedded within the economic hedge target, we identify and hedge market sensitivities to changes in equity markets, interest rates, volatility and for variable annuities, credit spreads. Each hedge program purchases derivative instruments or securities having sensitivities that offset those in the economic hedge target, within internally defined threshold levels. Since the relative movements of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target vary over time or with market changes, the net exposure can be outside the threshold limits, and adjustments to the hedging portfolio are made periodically to return the net exposure to within threshold limits.\n",
      "Our hedging programs utilize various derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts, interest rate swaps and swaption contracts, as well as other hedging instruments. In addition, for variable annuities, we purchase certain fixed income securities and elect the fair value option as a capital efficient way to manage interest rate and credit spread exposures. To\n",

      "minimize counterparty credit risk, the majority of our derivative instrument hedges are implemented using exchange-traded futures and options, cleared through global exchanges. Over the counter derivatives are highly collateralized.\n",
      "The hedging programs are monitored on a daily basis to ensure that the economic hedge target and derivative portfolio are within the threshold limits, pursuant to the approved hedge strategy. Daily risk monitoring verifies that the net risk exposures, as measured through sensitivities to a large set of market shocks, are within the approved net risk exposure threshold limits. In addition, monthly stress tests are performed to determine the program’s effectiveness relative to the applicable limits, under an array of combined severe market stresses in equity prices, interest rates, volatility and credit spreads. Finally, hedge strategies are reviewed regularly to gauge their effectiveness in managing our market exposures in the context of our overall risk appetite.\n",
      "Reinsurance Activities\n",
      "Reinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss (Life and Non-Life) exposure related to certain events such as natural and man-made catastrophes or death events. Our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.\n",
      "Reinsurance markets include:\n",
      "• Traditional local and global reinsurance markets including those in the United States, Bermuda, London and Europe, accessed directly and through reinsurance intermediaries;\n",
      "• Capital markets through insurance-linked securities and collateralized reinsurance transactions, such as catastrophe bonds, sidecars and similar vehicles; and\n",
      "• Other insurers that engage in both direct and assumed reinsurance.\n",
      "The form of reinsurance we may choose from time to time will generally depend on whether we are seeking:\n",
      "• proportional reinsurance, whereby we cede a specified percentage of premiums and losses to reinsurers;\n",
      "• non-proportional or excess of loss reinsurance, whereby we cede all or a specified portion of losses in excess of a specified amount on a per risk, per occurrence (including catastrophe reinsurance) or aggregate basis; or\n",
      "• facultative contracts that reinsure individual policies.\n",
      "We continually evaluate the relative attractiveness of different forms of reinsurance contracts and different markets that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives.\n",
      "Reinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. However, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.\n",
      "In certain markets, we are required to participate on a proportional basis in reinsurance pools based on our relative share of direct writings in those markets. Such mandatory reinsurance generally covers higher-risk consumer exposures such as assigned-risk automobile and earthquake, as well as certain commercial exposures such as workers’ compensation.\n",
      "Reinsurance Recoverable\n",
      "AIG’s reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of:\n",
      "• Paid losses recoverable - balances due from reinsurers for losses and loss adjustment expenses paid by our subsidiaries and billed, but not yet collected.\n",
      "• Ceded loss reserves - ultimate ceded reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, including reserves for claims reported but not yet paid and estimates for IBNR.\n",
      "• Ceded reserves for unearned premiums.\n",
      "• Life and Annuity reinsurance recoverables (ceded policy and claim reserves).\n",
      "AIG | 2017 Form 10-K\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "At December 31, 2017, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $33.0 billion. These assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $1.4 billion, ceded loss reserves of $26.9 billion including reserves for incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $3.1 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverable of $1.6 billion. The methods used to estimate IBNR and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. These methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments are reflected in income. We believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at December 31, 2017 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. Actual losses may, however, differ from the reserves currently ceded.\n",
      "The Reinsurance Credit Department (RCD) conducts periodic detailed assessments of the financial strength and condition of current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic. The RCD monitors both the financial condition of reinsurers as well as the total reinsurance recoverable ceded to reinsurers, and sets limits with regard to the amount and type of exposure we are willing to take with reinsurers. As part of these assessments, we attempt to identify whether a reinsurer is appropriately licensed, assess its financial capacity and liquidity, and evaluate the local economic and financial environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates. The RCD reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for measures, including collateral to mitigate credit risk. For example, in our treaty reinsurance contracts, we frequently include provisions that require a reinsurer to post collateral or use other measures to reduce exposure when a referenced event occurs. Furthermore, we limit our unsecured exposure to reinsurers through the use of credit triggers such as insurer financial strength rating downgrades, declines in regulatory capital, or relevant risk-based capital (RBC) ratios fall below certain levels. We also set maximum limits for reinsurance recoverable exposure, which in some cases is the recoverable amount plus an estimate of the maximum potential exposure from unexpected events for a reinsurer. In addition, credit executives within ERM review reinsurer exposures and credit limits and approve reinsurer credit limits above specified levels. Finally, even where we conclude that uncollateralized credit risk is acceptable, we require collateral from active reinsurance counterparties where it is necessary for our subsidiaries to recognize the reinsurance recoverable assets for statutory accounting purposes. At December 31, 2017, we held $20.5 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers. We believe that no exposure to a single reinsurer represents an inappropriate concentration of risk to AIG, nor is our business substantially dependent upon any single reinsurance contract.\n",
      "The following table presents information for each reinsurer representing in excess of five percent of our total reinsurance recoverable assets:\n",
      "(a) The financial strength ratings reflect the ratings of the various reinsurance subsidiaries of the companies listed as of February 8, 2018.\n",
      "(b) Total reinsurance assets include both Property Casualty and Life and Retirement reinsurance recoverable.\n",
      "(c) Excludes collateral held in excess of applicable treaty balances.\n",
      "(d) Includes $13.2 billion recoverable under the 2011 retroactive asbestos reinsurance transaction and the 2017 Adverse Development Reinsurance agreement.\n",
      "At December 31, 2017, we had no significant reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. Reinsurer capital levels continued to increase in 2017, thereby increasing the industry’s underwriting capacity, which resulted in continued competition and lower rates for 2018 renewals. Reduced profitability associated with lower rates could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. The RCD, in conjunction with the credit executives within ERM, reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require the reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.\n",

      "We utilize derivatives principally to enable us to hedge exposure to interest rates, currencies, credit, commodities, equities and other risks. Credit risk associated with derivative counterparties exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to us. The maximum potential exposure will increase or decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions. All derivative transactions must be transacted within counterparty limits that have been approved by ERM.\n",
      "We evaluate counterparty credit quality by internal analysis consistent with the AIG Credit Policy. We utilize various credit enhancements, including letters of credit, guarantees, collateral, credit triggers, credit derivatives, margin agreements and subordination to reduce the credit risk relating to outstanding financial derivative transactions. We require credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties, and transaction size and maturity. Furthermore, we enter into certain agreements that have the benefit of set-off and close-out netting provisions, such as ISDA Master Agreements.

      "Our loss reserves can generally be categorized into two distinct groups. Short-tail reserves consists principally of U.S. and Europe Property and Special Risks, and U.S., Europe and Japan Personal Insurance. Long-tail reserves include U.S. Workers’ Compensation, U.S. Excess Casualty, U.S. Other Casualty, U.S. Financial Lines, Europe Casualty and Financial Lines, and U.S. Run-off Long Tail Insurance Lines.\n",
      "Short-Tail Reserves\n",
      "For our short-tail coverages, such as property, where the nature of claims is generally high frequency but with short reporting periods, with volatility arising from occasional severe events, the process for recording non-catastrophe quarterly loss reserves is geared toward maintaining IBNR based on percentages of net earned premiums for that business, rather than projecting ultimate loss ratios based on reported losses. For example, the IBNR reserve required for the latest accident quarter for a product line of property business such as Personal Lines automobile might be approximately 20 percent of the quarter’s earned premiums. This level of reserve would generally be recorded regardless of the actual losses reported in the current quarter, thus allowing the recognition of severe events as they occur. The percent of premium factor reflects both our expectation of the ultimate loss costs associated with the line of business and the expectation of the percentage of ultimate loss costs that have not yet been reported. The expected ultimate loss costs generally reflect the average loss costs from a period of preceding accident quarters that have been adjusted for changes in rate and loss cost levels, mix of business, known exposure to unreported losses, or other factors affecting the particular line of business. The expected percentage of ultimate loss costs that have not yet been reported would be derived from historical loss emergence patterns. For more mature quarters, loss development methods would be used to determine the IBNR. For other product lines where the nature of claims is high frequency but low severity, methods including loss development, frequency/severity or a multiple of average monthly losses may be used to determine IBNR reserves. IBNR for claims arising from catastrophic events or events of unusual severity would be determined in close collaboration with the claims department’s knowledge of known information, using alternative techniques or expected percentages of ultimate loss cost emergence based on historical loss emergence of similar claim types.\n",
      "Long-Tail Reserves\n",
      "Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss adjustment expenses (net losses) for our long-tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the product line and volume of business, as well as estimates of the reinsurance recoverable. Experience in the more recent accident years generally provides limited statistical credibility of reported net losses on long-tail casualty lines of business. That is because in the more recent accident years, a relatively low proportion of estimated ultimate net incurred losses are reported or paid. Therefore, IBNR reserves constitute a relatively high proportion of net losses.\n",
      "For our longer-tail lines, we generally make actuarial and other assumptions with respect to the following:\n",
      "· Loss cost trend factors are used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on the projected loss ratios for prior accident years.\n",
      "· Expected loss ratios are used for the latest accident year (i.e., accident year 2016 for the year-end 2016 loss reserve analysis) and, in some cases for accident years prior to the latest accident year. The expected loss ratio generally reflects the projected loss ratio from prior accident years, adjusted for the loss cost trend and the effect of rate changes and other quantifiable factors on the loss ratio. For low-frequency, high-severity lines of business such as excess casualty, expected loss ratios generally are used for at least the three most recent accident years.\n",
      "· Loss development factors are used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate basis. Generally, the actual loss development factors observed from prior accident years would be used as a basis to determine the loss development factors for the subsequent accident years.\n",
      "· Tail Factors are development factors used for certain longer tailed lines of business (for example, excess casualty, workers’ compensation and general liability),to project future loss development for periods that extend beyond the available development data. The development of losses to the ultimate loss for a given accident year for these lines may take decades and the projection of ultimate losses for an accident year is very sensitive to the tail factors selected beyond a certain age.\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Critical Accounting Estimates\n",
      "We record quarterly changes in loss reserves for each product line of business. The overall change in our loss reserves is based on the sum of the changes for all product lines of business. For most long-tail product lines of business, the quarterly loss reserve changes are based on the estimated current loss ratio for each subset of coverage less any amounts paid. Also, any change in estimated ultimate losses from prior accident years deemed to be necessary based on the results of our latest detailed valuation reviews, large loss analyses, or other analytical techniques, either positive or negative, is reflected in the loss reserve for the current quarter. Differences between actual loss emergence in a given period and our expectations based on prior loss reserve estimates are used to monitor reserve adequacy between detailed valuation reviews and may also influence our judgment with respect to adjusting reserve estimates.\n",
      "Details of the Loss Reserving Process\n",
      "The process of determining the current loss ratio for each product line of business is based on a variety of factors. These include considerations such as: prior accident year and policy year loss ratios; rate changes; and changes in coverage, reinsurance, or mix of business. Other considerations include actual and anticipated changes in external factors such as trends in loss costs, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, inflation, employment rates or unemployment duration, stock market volatility, corporate bond spreads, or in the legal and claims environment. The current loss ratio for each product line of business is intended to represent our best estimate after reflecting all of the relevant factors. At the close of each quarter, the assumptions and data underlying the loss ratios are reviewed to determine whether the loss ratios remain appropriate. This process includes a review of the actual loss experience in the quarter, actual rate changes achieved, actual changes in reinsurance, quantifiable changes in coverage or mix of business, and changes in other factors that may affect the loss ratio. When this review suggests that the previously determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate, the loss ratio is changed to reflect the revised estimates.\n",
      "We conduct a comprehensive loss detailed valuation review at least annually for each product line of business in accordance with Actuarial Standards of Practice. These standards provide that the unpaid loss estimate may be presented in a variety of ways, such as a point estimate, a range of estimates, a point estimate based on the expected value of several reasonable estimates, or a probability distribution of the unpaid loss amount. Our actuarial central estimate for each product line of business represents an expected value generally considering a range of reasonably possible outcomes.\n",
      "The reserve analysis for each product line of business is performed by a credentialed actuarial team in collaboration with claims, underwriting, business unit management, risk management and senior management. Our actuaries consider the ongoing applicability of prior data groupings and update numerous assumptions, including the analysis and selection of loss development and loss trend factors. They also determine and select the most appropriate actuarial or other methods used to estimate reserve adequacy for each business product line, and may employ multiple methods and assumptions for each product line. These data groupings, accident year weights, method selections and assumptions necessarily change over time as business mix changes, development factors mature and become more credible and loss characteristics evolve. In the course of these detailed valuation reviews an actuarial best estimate of the loss reserve is determined. The sum of these estimates for each product line of business yields an overall actuarial best estimate for that line of business.\n",
      "We develop explicit ranges of reasonable estimates around the actuarial best estimate for certain product lines using multiple methodologies and varying assumptions. Where we have ranges, we use them to inform our selection of best estimates of loss reserves by major product line of business. Our range of reasonable estimates is not intended to cover all possibilities or extreme values and is based on known data and facts at the time of estimation.\n",
      "We consult with third party environmental litigation and engineering specialists, third party toxic tort claims professionals, third party clinical and public health specialists, third party workers’ compensation claims adjusters and third party actuarial advisors to help inform our judgments, as needed.\n",
      "A critical component of our detailed valuation reviews is a peer review of our reserving analyses and conclusions, where actuaries independent of the initial review evaluate the reasonableness of assumptions used, methods selected and weightings given to different methods. In addition, each detailed valuation review is subjected to a review and challenge process by specialists in our Enterprise Risk Management group.\n",

      "Actuarial and Other Methods for Major Lines of Business\n",
      "Our actuaries determine the most appropriate actuarial methods and segmentation. This determination is based on a variety of factors including the nature of the losses associated with the product line of business, such as the frequency or severity of the claims. In addition to determining the actuarial methods, the actuaries determine the appropriate loss reserve groupings of data. This determination is a judgmental, dynamic process and refinements to the groupings are made every year. The changes to groupings may be driven by and may change to reflect observed or emerging patterns within and across product lines, or to differentiate different risk characteristics (for example, size of deductibles and extent of third party claims specialists used by our insureds). As an example of reserve segmentation, we write many unique subsets of professional liability. For pricing or other purposes, it is appropriate to evaluate the profitability of each subset individually. However, for purposes of estimating the liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses for many product lines of business, we believe it is appropriate to combine the subsets into larger groups to produce a greater degree of credibility in the loss experience. This determination of data segmentation and related actuarial methods is assessed, reviewed and updated at least annually.\n",
      "The actuarial methods we use most commonly include paid and incurred loss development methods, expected loss ratio methods, including “Bornhuetter Ferguson” and “Cape Cod”, and frequency/severity models. Loss development methods utilize the actual loss development patterns from prior accident years updated through the current year to project the reported losses to an ultimate basis for all accident years. We also use this information to update our current accident year loss selections. Loss development methods are generally most appropriate for classes of business that exhibit a stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next, and for which the components of the product line have similar development characteristics. For example, property exposures would generally not be combined into the same product line as casualty exposures, and primary casualty exposures would generally not be combined into the same product line as excess casualty exposures. We continually refine our loss reserving techniques for the domestic primary casualty product line of business and adopt further segmentations based on our analysis of differing emerging loss patterns for certain product lines. We generally use expected loss ratio methods in cases where the reported loss data lacked sufficient credibility to utilize loss development methods, such as for new product lines of business or for long-tail product lines at early stages of loss development. Frequency/severity models may be used where sufficient frequency counts are available to apply such approaches.\n",
      "Expected loss ratio methods rely on the application of an expected loss ratio to the earned premium for the product line of business to determine the liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses. For example, an expected loss ratio of 70 percent applied to an earned premium base of $10 million for a product line of business would generate an ultimate loss estimate of $7 million. Subtracting any paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve for this product line. Under the Bornhuetter Ferguson methods, the expected loss ratio is applied only to the expected unreported portion of the losses. For example, for a long-tail product line of business for which only 10 percent of the losses are expected to be reported at the end of the accident year, the expected loss ratio would be used to represent the 90 percent of losses still unreported. The actual reported losses at the end of the accident year would be added to determine the total ultimate loss estimate for the accident year. Subtracting the reported paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve. In the example above, the expected loss ratio of 70 percent would be multiplied by 90 percent. The result of 63 percent would be applied to the earned premium of $10 million resulting in an estimated unreported loss of $6.3 million. Actual reported losses would be added to arrive at the total ultimate losses. If the reported losses were $1 million, the ultimate loss estimate under the Bornhuetter Ferguson method would be $7.3 million versus the $7 million amount under the expected loss ratio method described above. Thus, the Bornhuetter Ferguson method gives partial credibility to the actual loss experience to date for the product line of business. Loss development methods generally give full credibility to the reported\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K 43\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Critical Accounting Estimates\n",
      "loss experience to date. In the example above, loss development methods would typically indicate an ultimate loss estimate of $10 million, as the reported losses of $1 million would be estimated to reflect only 10 percent of the ultimate losses.\n",
      "A key advantage of loss development methods is that they respond more quickly to any actual changes in loss costs for the product line of business. Therefore, if loss experience is unexpectedly deteriorating or improving, the loss development method gives full credibility to the changing experience. Expected loss ratio methods would be slower to respond to the change, as they would continue to give more weight to a prior expected loss ratio, until enough evidence emerged to modify the expected loss ratio to reflect the changing loss experience. On the other hand, loss development methods have the disadvantage of overreacting to changes in reported losses if the loss experience is anomalous due to the various key factors described above and the inherent volatility in some of the classes. For example, the presence or absence of large losses at the early stages of loss development could cause the loss development method to overreact to the favorable or unfavorable experience by assuming it is a fundamental shift in the development pattern. In these instances, expected loss ratio methods such as Bornhuetter Ferguson have the advantage of recognizing large losses without extrapolating unusual large loss activity onto the unreported portion of the losses for the accident year.\n",
      "The Cape Cod method is a hybrid between the loss development and Bornhuetter Ferguson methods, where the historic loss data and loss development factor assumptions are used to determine the expected loss ratio estimate in the Bornhuetter Ferguson method.\n",
      "Frequency/severity methods generally rely on the determination of an ultimate number of claims and an average severity for each claim for each accident year. Multiplying the estimated ultimate number of claims for each accident year by the expected average severity of each claim produces the estimated ultimate loss for the accident year. Frequency/severity methods generally require a sufficient volume of claims in order for the average severity to be predictable. Average severity for subsequent accident years is generally determined by applying an estimated annual loss cost trend to the estimated average claim severity from prior accident years. In certain cases, a structural approach may also be used to predict the ultimate loss cost. Frequency/severity methods have the advantage that ultimate claim counts can generally be estimated more quickly and accurately than can ultimate losses. Thus, if the average claim severity can be accurately estimated, these methods can more quickly respond to changes in loss experience than other methods. However, for average severity to be predictable, the product line of business must consist of homogenous types of claims for which loss severity trends from one year to the next are reasonably consistent and where there are limited changes to deductible levels or limits. Generally these methods work best for high frequency, low severity product lines of business such as personal auto. However, frequency and severity metrics are also used to test the reasonability of results for other product lines of business and provide indications of underlying trends in the data. In addition, ultimate claim counts can be used as an alternative exposure measure to earned premiums in the Cape Cod method.\n",
      "Structural driver analytics seek to explain the underlying drivers of frequency/severity. A structural driver analysis of frequency/severity is particularly useful for understanding the key drivers of uncertainty in the ultimate loss cost. For example, for the excess workers’ compensation product line of business, we have attempted to corroborate our judgment by considering the impact on severity of the future potential for deterioration of an injured worker’s medical condition, the impact of price inflation on the various categories of medical expense and cost of living adjustments on indemnity benefits, the impact of injured worker mortality and claim specific settlement and loss mitigation strategies, etc., using the following:\n",
      "• Claim by claim reviews, often facilitated by third party specialists, to determine the stability and likelihood of settling an injured worker’s indemnity and medical benefits;\n",
      "• Analysis of the potential for future deterioration in medical condition unlikely to be picked up by a claim file review and associated with potentially costly medical procedures (i.e., increases in both utilization and intensity of medical care) over the course of the injured worker’s lifetime;\n",
      "• Analysis of the cost of medical price inflation for each category of medical spend (services and devices) and for cost of living adjustments in line with statutory requirements;\n",
      "• Portfolio specific mortality level and mortality improvement assumptions based on a mortality study conducted for our primary and excess workers’ compensation portfolios and our opinion of future longevity trends for the open reported cases;\n",
      "• Ground-up consideration of the reinsurance recoveries expected for the product line of business for reported claims with extrapolation for unreported claims; and\n",
      "• The effects of various run-off loss management strategies that have been developed by our run-off unit.\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K 44\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Critical Accounting Estimates\n",
      "In recent years, we have expanded our analysis of structural drivers to additional product lines of business as a means of corroborating our judgments using traditional actuarial techniques. For example, we have explicitly used external estimates of future medical inflation and mortality in estimating the loss development tail for excess of deductible primary workers’ compensation business. Using external forecasts for items such as these can improve the accuracy and stability of our estimates.\n",
      "The estimation of liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental pollution losses on insurance policies written many years ago is typically subject to greater uncertainty than other types of losses. This is due to inconsistent court decisions, as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies or have expanded theories of liability. In addition, reinsurance recoverable balances relating to asbestos and environmental loss reserves are subject to greater uncertainty due to the underlying age of the claim, underlying legal issues surrounding the nature of the coverage, and determination of proper policy period. For these reasons, these balances tend to be subject to increased levels of disputes and legal collection activity when actually billed. The insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures.\n",
      "We continue to receive claims asserting injuries and damages from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged claims to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites, referred to collectively as environmental claims, and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. The vast majority of these asbestos and environmental losses emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained absolute exclusions for pollution-related damage and asbestos. The current environmental policies that we specifically price and underwrite for environmental risks on a claims-made basis have been excluded from the analysis.\n",
      "The majority of our exposures for asbestos and environmental losses are related to excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. The litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity amounts, with litigation expenses included within the limits of the liability we incur. Individual significant loss reserves, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case-by-case basis.\n",

      "Key Assumptions\n",
      "U.S. Workers’\n",
      "Compensation\n",
      "We generally use a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for U.S. Workers’ Compensation. U.S. Workers’ Compensation is a long-tail class of business, and our business reflects a very significant volume of losses, particularly in more recent accident years.\n",
      "The loss cost trend assumption is not believed to be material with respect to our loss reserves. This is primarily because our actuaries are generally able to use loss development projections for all but the most recent accident year’s reserves, so there is limited need to rely on loss cost trend assumptions for primary workers’ compensation business.\n",
      "The tail factor is typically the most critical assumption, and small changes in the selected tail factor can have a material effect on our carried reserves. For example, the tail factors beyond twenty years for guaranteed cost business could vary by one percent above or below those actually indicated in the 2016 loss reserve review. For excess of deductible business, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that tail factors beyond twenty years could vary by five percent above or below those actually indicated in the 2016 loss reserve review.\n",

      "Business or Category\n",
      "Key Assumptions\n",
      "U.S. Excess Casualty\n",
      "We utilize various loss cost trend assumptions for different segments of the portfolio. After evaluating the historical loss cost trends from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss cost trends applicable to the year-end 2016 loss reserve review for U.S. Excess Casualty may range five percent lower or higher than this estimated loss trend. The loss cost trend assumption is critical for the U.S. Excess Casualty class of business due to the long-tail nature of the losses, and is applied across many accident years. Thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years (the expected loss ratio years) to be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends that were initially relied upon in setting the loss reserves. These changes in loss trends could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.\n",
      "U.S. Excess Casualty is a long-tail class of business and any deviation in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. Mass tort claims in particular may develop over a very extended period and impact multiple accident years, so we usually select a separate pattern for them. Thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years to be significantly affected by changes in loss development factors that were initially relied upon in setting the reserves.\n",
      "After evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the actual loss development factors could vary by an amount equivalent to a six month shift from those actually utilized in the year-end 2016 reserve review. This would impact projections both for accident years where the selections were directly based on loss development methods as well as the a priori loss ratio assumptions for accident years with selections based on Bornhuetter-Ferguson or Cape Cod methods. Similar to loss cost trends, these changes in loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.\n",
      "U.S. Other Casualty\n",
      "The key uncertainties for other casualty lines are similar to excess casualty, as the underlying business is long-tailed and can be subject to variability in loss cost trends and changes in loss development factors. These may differ significantly by line of business as coverages such as general liability, medical malpractice and environmental may be subject to different risk drivers.\n",
      "U.S. Financial Lines\n",
      "The loss cost trends for U.S. D&O business vary by year and subset, but for the most recent accident years, it is assumed to have been generally close to zero. After evaluating the historical loss cost levels from prior accident years since the early 1990s, including the potential effect of losses relating to the credit crisis, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the actual variation in loss cost levels for these subsets could vary by approximately 15 percent lower or higher on a year-over-year basis than the assumptions actually utilized in the year-end 2016 reserve review. Because U.S. D&O business has exhibited highly volatile loss trends from one accident year to the next, there is the possibility of an exceptionally high deviation. In our analysis, the effects of loss cost trend assumptions affect the results through the a priori loss ratio assumptions used for the Bornhuetter-Ferguson and Cape Cod methods, which impact the projections for the two most recent two accident years.\n",
      "The assumed loss development factors are also an important assumption, but are less critical than for U.S. Excess Casualty. Because these classes are written on a claims made basis, the loss reporting and development tail is much shorter than for U.S. Excess Casualty. However, the high severity nature of the losses does create the potential for significant deviations in loss development patterns from one year to the next. Similar to Excess Casualty, after evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss development factors could change by an amount equivalent to a shift by six months from those actually utilized in the year-end 2016 reserve review.\n",
      "Europe Casualty and Financial Lines\n",
      "Similar to U.S. business, European Casualty and Financial Lines can be significantly impacted by loss cost trends and changes in loss development factors. The variation in such factors can differ significantly by product and region.\n",
      "U.S. and Europe Property and Special Risks\n",
      "For short-tail lines such as Property and Special Risks, variance in outcomes for individual large claims or events can have a significant impact on results. These outcomes generally relate to unique characteristics of events such as catastrophes or losses with significant business interruption claims.\n",
      "U.S., Europe, and Japan Personal Insurance\n",
      "Personal Insurance is short -tailed in nature similar to Property and Special Risks but less volatile. Variance in estimates can result from unique events such as catastrophes. In addition, some subsets of this business, such as auto liability, can be impacted by changes in loss development factors and loss cost trends.\n",

      "U.S. Run-off Long Tail Insurance lines\n",
      "We historically have used a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for excess workers’ compensation and other run-off segments. For environmental claims, we have utilized a variety of methods including traditional loss development approaches, claim department and other expert evaluations of the ultimate costs for certain claims and survival ratio metrics.\n",
      "U.S. Run-off Long Tail Insurance lines is an extremely long-tail class of business, with a much greater than normal uncertainty as to the appropriate loss development factors for the tail of the loss development. Specifically for excess workers’ compensation, after evaluating the historical loss development factors for prior accident years since the 1980s as well as the development over the past several years of the ground up loss projections utilized to help select the loss development factors in the tail for this class of business, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the tail factor beyond 30 years could vary by 10 percent above or below that actually indicated in the 2016 loss reserve review.\n",
      "Other Reserve Items\n",
      "Loss adjustment expenses (LAE) are separated into two broad categories, allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE), also referred to as legal defense and cost containment or “legal” and unallocated loss adjustment expenses (ULAE), which includes certain claims adjuster fees and other internal claim management costs.\n",
      "We determine loss adjustment expenses reserves for legal expenses for each class of business by one or more actuarial or structural driver methods. For the majority of segments, legal costs are analyzed in conjunction with losses. For segments where they are separately analyzed the methods used generally include development methods comparable to those described for loss development methods. The development could be based on either the paid loss adjustment expenses or the ratio of paid loss adjustment expenses to paid losses, or both. Other methods include the utilization of expected ultimate ratios of paid loss expense to paid losses, based on actual experience from prior accident years or from similar product lines of business.\n",
      "The bulk of adjuster expenses are allocated and charged to individual claim files. For these expenses, we generally determine reserves based on calendar year ratios of adjuster expenses paid to losses paid for the particular product line of business. For other internal claim costs, which generally relate to specific claim department expenses that are not specifically allocated to claim files such as technology costs and other broad initiatives, we look at historic and expected expenditures for these items and project these into the future.\n",
      "The incidence of LAE are directly related to the frequency, complexity and level of underlying claims. As a result, key drivers of variability in LAE is the variability in the overall claims, particularly for long tail lines.\n",
      "The following sensitivity analysis table summarizes the effect on the loss reserve position of using certain alternative loss cost trend (for accident years where we use expected loss ratio methods) or loss development factor assumptions rather than the assumptions actually used in determining our estimates in the year-end loss reserve analyses in 2016.\n",

      "Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health Insurance Contracts\n",
      "Long-duration traditional products include whole life insurance, term life insurance, accident and health insurance, long-term care insurance, and certain payout annuities for which the payment period is life-contingent, which include certain of our single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements.\n",
      "For long-duration traditional business, a “lock-in” principle applies. The assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. The assumptions include mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses, and investment returns. These assumptions are typically consistent with pricing inputs. The assumptions also include margins for adverse deviation, principally for key assumptions such as mortality and interest rates used to discount cash flows, to reflect uncertainty given that actual experience might deviate from these assumptions. Establishing margins at contract inception requires management judgment. The extent of the margin for adverse deviation may vary depending on the uncertainty of the cash flows, which is affected by the volatility of the business and the extent of our experience with the product.\n",
      "Loss recognition occurs if observed changes in actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses under loss recognition testing. To determine whether loss recognition exists, we determine whether a future loss is expected based on updated current assumptions. If loss recognition exists, we recognize the loss by first reducing DAC through amortization expense, and, if DAC is depleted, record additional liabilities through a charge to policyholder benefit expense. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on loss recognition. Because of the long-term nature of many of our liabilities subject to the “lock-in” principle, small changes in certain assumptions may cause large changes in the degree of reserve adequacy. In particular, changes in estimates of future invested asset returns have a large effect on the degree of reserve deficiency.\n",
      "Groupings for loss recognition testing are consistent with our manner of acquiring, servicing, and measuring the profitability of the business and are applied by product groupings. We perform separate loss recognition tests for traditional life products, payout annuities, and long-term care insurance. Once loss recognition has been recorded for a block of business, the old assumption set is replaced and the assumption set used for the loss recognition would then be subject to the lock-in principle. Key judgments made in loss recognition testing include the following:\n",
      "• To determine investment returns used in loss recognition tests, we typically segregate assets that match the duration of our liabilities with assets of comparable duration, to the extent practicable, and then project future cash flows on those assets. Assets supporting insurance liabilities are primarily comprised of a diversified portfolio of high quality fixed maturity securities, and may also include, to a lesser extent, alternative investments. Our projections include a reasonable allowance for investment expenses and expected credit losses over the projection horizon. A critical assumption in the projection of expected investment income is the assumed net rate of investment return at which excess cash flows are to be reinvested. For products in which asset and liability durations are matched relatively well, this is less of a consideration since interest on excess cash flows are not a significant component of future cash flows. For the reinvestment rate assumption, anticipated future changes to the yield curves could have a large effect. Given the interest rate environment applicable at the date of our most recent loss recognition tests, we assumed a modest and gradual increase in long-term interest rates over time.\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K 48\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Critical Accounting Estimates\n",
      "• For mortality assumptions, key judgments include the extent of industry versus own experience to base future assumptions as well as the extent of expected mortality improvements in the future. The latter judgment is based on a combination of historical mortality trends and advice from industry, public health and demography specialists that were consulted by AIG’s actuaries and published industry information.\n",
      "• For surrender rates, a key judgment involves the correlation between expected increases/decreases in interest rates and increases/decreases in surrender rates. To support this judgment, we compare crediting rates on our products relative to expected rates on competing products under different interest rate scenarios.\n",
      "• For in-force long-term care insurance, rate increases are allowed but must be approved by state insurance regulators. Consequently, the extent of rate increases that may be assumed requires judgment. In establishing our assumption for rate increases for long-term care insurance, we consider historical experience as to the frequency and level of rate increases approved by state regulators.\n",
      "Significant unrealized appreciation on investments in a prolonged low interest rate environment may cause DAC to be adjusted and additional future policy benefit liabilities to be recorded through a charge directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (“shadow loss recognition”). These charges are included, net of tax, with the change in net unrealized appreciation of investments. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on shadow loss recognition. In applying shadow loss recognition, the Company overlays unrealized gains onto loss recognition tests without revising the underlying test. Accordingly, there is limited additional judgment in this process.\n",
      "Guaranteed Benefit Features of Variable Annuity Products\n",
      "Variable annuity products offered by our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement product lines offer guaranteed benefit features. These guaranteed features include guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) that are payable in the event of death or other instances, and living benefits that are payable in the event of annuitization, or, in other instances, at specified dates during the accumulation period. Living benefits include guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB) and guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB). See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these features.\n",
      "The liabilities for GMDB and GMIB, which are recorded in Future policyholder benefits, represent the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account value, with the excess recognized ratably through Policyholder benefits and losses incurred over the accumulation period based on total expected fee assessments. The liabilities for GMWB, which are recorded in Policyholder contract deposits, are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value of the liabilities recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses).\n",
      "Our exposure to the guaranteed amounts is equal to the amount by which the contract holder’s account balance is below the amount provided by the guaranteed feature. A variable annuity contract may include more than one type of guaranteed benefit feature; for example, it may have both a GMDB and a GMWB. However, a policyholder can generally only receive payout from one guaranteed feature on a contract containing a death benefit and a living benefit, i.e. the features are generally mutually exclusive, so the exposure to the guaranteed amount for each feature is independent of the exposure from other features (except a surviving spouse who has a rider to potentially collect both a GMDB upon their spouse’s death and a GMWB during his or her lifetime). A policyholder cannot purchase more than one living benefit on one contract. Declines in the equity markets, increased volatility and a sustained low interest rate environment increase our exposure to potential benefits under the guaranteed features, leading to an increase in the liabilities for those benefits. See Estimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products (Life Insurance Companies) below for sensitivity analysis which includes the sensitivity of reserves for guaranteed benefit features to changes in the assumptions for interest rates, equity market returns, volatility, and mortality.

      "Estimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products\n",
      "Policy acquisition costs and policy issuance costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal of existing insurance contracts related to universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) are generally deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over a period that approximates the estimated lives of the contracts, except in instances where significant negative gross profits are expected in one or more periods. Estimated gross profits include net investment income and spreads, net realized capital gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses, and mortality gains and losses. In estimating future gross profits, lapse assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on DAC amortization. For fixed deferred annuity contracts, the future spread between investment income and interest credited to policyholders is a significant judgment, particularly in a low interest rate environment.\n",
      "If the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC and related reserves, including VOBA, SIA, guaranteed benefit reserves and unearned revenue reserve (URR), are recalculated using the new assumptions, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. Updating such assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.\n",
      "In estimating future gross profits for variable annuity products as of December 31, 2016, a long-term annual asset growth assumption of 7.5 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected) was applied to estimate the future growth in assets and related asset-based fees. In determining the asset growth rate, the effect of short-term fluctuations in the equity markets is partially mitigated through the use of a reversion to the mean methodology, whereby short-term asset growth above or\n",

The reversion to the mean methodology allows us to maintain our long-term growth assumptions, while also giving consideration to the effect of actual investment performance. When actual performance significantly deviates from the annual long-term growth assumption, as evidenced by growth assumptions for the five-year reversion to the mean period falling below a certain rate (floor) or above a certain rate (cap) for a sustained period, judgment may be applied to revise or “unlock” the growth rate assumptions to be used for both the five-year reversion to the mean period as well as the long-term annual growth assumption applied to subsequent periods. The use of a reversion to the mean assumption is common within the industry; however, the parameters used in the methodology are subject to judgment and vary within the industry.

      "The estimation of reinsurance recoverable involves a significant amount of judgment, particularly for latent exposures, such as asbestos, due to their long-tail nature. Reinsurance assets include reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses that are estimated as part of our loss reserving process and, consequently, are subject to similar judgments and uncertainties as the estimation of gross loss reserves.\n",
      "We assess the collectability of reinsurance recoverable balances through either detailed reviews of the underlying nature of the reinsurance balance or comparisons with historical trends of disputes and credit events. We record adjustments to reflect the results of these assessments through an allowance for uncollectable reinsurance that reduces the carrying amount of reinsurance assets on the balance sheet.

The standard also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties and additional disclosures. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, based on technical merits, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recognized in the financial statements.

The sale of UGC and its subsidiaries closed on December 31, 2016, and we received proceeds of approximately $3.3 billion. Concurrent with the closing, we entered into reinsurance agreements with Arch, including an amended and restated 50 percent quota share reinsurance agreement and an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement, pursuant to which we will continue to be exposed to certain UGC policies written between 2009 and 2016. We expect the results of these reinsurance arrangements to continue to be reported in Commercial Insurance.\n",

This transaction is expected to result in a tax sharing payment by the Life Insurance Companies to AIG Parent in 2017.\n",
      "• Our catastrophe reinsurance program includes coverage for natural catastrophes and some coverage for terrorism events. It consists of a large North American occurrence cover (without reinstatement) to protect against large North America losses, and Japan covers to protect against losses in Japan. Effective January 1, 2017, the attachment point for this reinsurance program is at $1.5 billion for the North American cover ($3 billion in 2016) and varies for the Japan covers.

We continued to operate under difficult market conditions in 2016, characterized by factors such as historically low interest rates, instability in the global equity markets, volatile energy markets, slowing growth in China and Euro-Zone economies, and the United Kingdom (the UK) advisory referendum in which a majority voted for the UK to withdraw its membership in the European Union (the EU) (commonly referred to as Brexit). The Brexit vote has also affected the U.S. dollar/British pound exchange rate, increased the volatility of exchange rates among the euro, British pound and the Japanese yen (the Major Currencies), and created volatility in the financial markets, which may continue for some time.\n",
      "Impact of Changes in the Interest Rate Environment\n",
      "Interest rates increased late in 2016, but have remained at historically low levels. Certain markets in which we operate have experienced negative interest rates. A sustained low interest rate environment negatively affects sales of interest rate sensitive products in our industry and may negatively impact the profitability of our existing business as we reinvest cash flows from investments, including increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolios. We actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through asset-liability management including spread management strategies for our investment-oriented products and economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable and fixed index annuities.\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K 59\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Executive Summary\n",
      "Annuity Sales and Surrenders\n",
      "The sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry. Low long-term interest rates put pressure on investment returns, which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products. However, our disciplined rate setting has helped to mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. As long as the low interest rate environment continues, conditions will be challenging for the fixed annuity market. Rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased sales, but may also drive higher surrenders. Customers are, however, currently buying fixed annuities with longer surrender periods in pursuit of higher returns, which may help mitigate the rate of increase in surrenders in a rapidly rising rate environment. In addition, older contracts that have higher minimum interest rates and continue to be attractive to the contract holders are driving better than expected persistency, although the reserves for such contracts have continued to decrease over time in amount and as a percentage of the total annuity portfolio. Low interest rates have also driven growth in our fixed index annuity products, which provide additional interest crediting tied to favorable performance in certain equity market indices and the availability of guaranteed living benefits. Changes in interest rates significantly impact the valuation of our liabilities for guaranteed products with income features and the value of the related hedging portfolio.\n",
      "Reinvestment and Spread Management\n",
      "We actively monitor fixed income markets, including the level of interest rates, credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve. We also frequently review our interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for new and in-force business. Business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a historically low interest rate environment. The low interest rate environment makes it more difficult to profitably price many of our products and puts margin pressure on existing products, due to the challenge of investing recurring premiums and deposits and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows in the low rate environment while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity. In addition, there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain in-force business. Specifically, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities.\n",
      "The contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in products may reduce spreads in a sustained low interest rate environment and thus reduce future profitability. Although this interest rate risk is partially mitigated through the asset-liability management process, product design elements and crediting rate strategies, a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability.\n",
      "The following table presents Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement base net investment spread:\n",
      "In Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement, average interest crediting rates decreased slightly in 2016 and 2015 compared to the preceding years due to active crediting rate management. However, the decline in base investment yields, driven by investment purchases and investment of portfolio cash flows at rates below the weighted average yield of the existing portfolio in the sustained low interest rate environment, resulted in base spread compression. See Investments for additional information on our investment and asset-liability management strategies.\n",
      "For investment-oriented products in our Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance and Institutional Markets businesses, our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business, modifying or limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads, using asset-liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable, and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. Renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals in accordance with state and federal laws and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. We will continue to adjust crediting rates on in-force business to mitigate the pressure on spreads from declining base yields, but our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by the competitive environment, contractual minimum crediting rates, and provisions that allow rates to be reset only at pre-established intervals. For example, competitors including private equity-held annuity writers are currently offering higher crediting rates. As a result, the timing and extent of crediting rate decreases may differ from the corresponding declines in investment yields, which could reduce our spreads and future profitability.\n",
      "As shown in the table below, 73 percent of the fixed account values of our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement annuity products in the aggregate were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at December 31, 2016. As a result of disciplined pricing on new business and the run-off of older business with higher crediting rates, the percentage of fixed account values of our annuity products that are currently crediting at rates above one percent decreased to 70 percent at December 31, 2016,\n",

      "Assumption Updates and Loss Recognition\n",
      "Spreads and surrender rates are important components of the future profit assumptions that drive the rate we use to amortize DAC and related reserves for investment-oriented products. If future profit assumptions change significantly, we may be required to recalculate DAC and related reserves, and reflect any resulting adjustments in current period income. In addition to investment-oriented products, certain traditional long-duration products for which we do not have the ability to adjust interest rates, such as structured settlements and payout annuities, are exposed to reduced earnings and potential loss recognition reserve increases in a sustained low interest rate environment. See Insurance Reserves - Life and Annuity Reserves and DAC - Update of Actuarial Assumptions for discussion of such adjustments recorded in 2016, 2015 and 2014 in our Consumer Insurance and Legacy Life Insurance Run-Off Lines.\n",
      "Commercial Insurance\n",
      "The impact of low interest rates on our Commercial Insurance segment is primarily on our long-tail Casualty line of business. We expect limited impacts on our existing long-tail Casualty business as the duration of our assets is slightly longer than that of our liabilities. We do expect sustained low interest rates will impact new and renewal business for the long-tail Casualty line as we may\n",

      "In addition, for our Commercial Insurance segment and run-off insurance lines reported within the Legacy Portfolio, sustained low interest rates may unfavorably affect the net loss reserve discount for workers’ compensation, and to a lesser extent could favorably impact assumptions about future medical costs; the combined net effect of which could result in higher net loss reserves.\n",
      "Additionally, sustained low interest rates on discounting of projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans may result in higher pension expense.\n",
      "Department of Labor Fiduciary Rule\n",
      "Our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement operating segments provide products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, including the requirements of the DOL Fiduciary Rule. For additional information about the DOL Fiduciary Rule, see Part I, Item 1. Business - Regulation. We have been analyzing the DOL Fiduciary Rule’s potential impact on our customers, distribution partners, financial advisors and our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement businesses, and preparing to implement the necessary adjustments to achieve compliance with the DOL Fiduciary Rule. Overall, the DOL Fiduciary Rule as currently promulgated would result in increased compliance costs and, as currently promulgated, may create increased exposure to legal claims under certain circumstances, including class actions. The DOL has also issued interpretive guidance on the DOL Fiduciary Rule, and we are evaluating whether or not this guidance would affect the actions we would need to take to comply with the DOL Fiduciary Rule.\n",
      "On February 3, 2017, the new administration issued a memo requiring the DOL to review the DOL Fiduciary Rule and determine whether the DOL Fiduciary Rule will adversely impact the ability of retirement savers to access information and financial advice. Accordingly, the DOL announced that it would consider legal options for postponing the applicability date of the DOL Fiduciary Rule while the DOL considers the issues raised in the referenced memo. We are closely following the DOL’s pronouncements about further delays to the DOL Fiduciary Rule’s effective date.\n",
      "Impact of Currency Volatility\n",
      "Currency volatility in 2016 and 2015 was acute compared to recent years, as the British pound weakened considerably against the U.S. dollar in 2016, although the Japanese yen strengthened against the U.S. dollar. The euro also weakened modestly against the U.S. dollar. Such volatility affected line item components of income for those businesses with substantial international operations. In particular, growth trends in net premiums written reported in U.S. dollars can differ significantly from those measured in original currencies. The net effect on underwriting results, however, is significantly mitigated, as both revenues and expenses are similarly affected.\n",
      "These currencies may continue to fluctuate, in either direction, especially as a result of the UK’s expected exit from the EU, and such fluctuations will affect net premiums written growth trends reported in U.S. dollars, as well as financial statement line item comparability.\n",

These earnings relate to ongoing operations and have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. Further, we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund U.S. operations. As a result, U.S. deferred taxes have not been provided on $2 billion of accumulated earnings, including accumulated other comprehensive income, of these non-U.S. affiliates. Potential U.S. income tax liabilities related to such earnings would be offset, in whole or in part, by allowable foreign tax credits resulting from foreign taxes paid to foreign jurisdictions in which such operations are located. As a result, we currently believe that any incremental U.S. income tax liabilities relating to indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings would not be significant. Deferred taxes have been provided on earnings of non-U.S. affiliates whose earnings are not indefinitely reinvested.

Insurance companies compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product pricing, service and terms and conditions. Commercial Insurance seeks to distinguish itself in the insurance industry primarily based on its well-established brand, global franchise, multinational capabilities, financial and capital strength, innovative products, claims expertise to handle complex claims, expertise in providing specialized coverages and customer service.\n",
      "We serve our business and individual customers on a global basis - from the largest multinational corporations to local businesses and individuals. Our clients benefit from our substantial underwriting expertise.\n",
      "Our challenges include:\n",

      "• long-tail exposures create added challenges to pricing and risk management;\n",
      "• over capacity in certain lines of business creates downward market pressure on pricing;\n",

      "OUTLOOK-INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC FACTORS\n",
      "Below is a discussion of the industry and economic factors impacting our specific business:\n",
      "Liability and Financial Lines\n",
      "We have observed an increase in frequency of severity of losses, particularly in Auto, which is impacting not only the primary books, but also having leverage impacts on excess layers. Loss cost trend rates across U.S. casualty lines in general are increasing with the exception of U.S. workers’ compensation. The market is still challenging in terms of the level of capacity, which is continuing to impact the rate environment. The overall rates we have achieved have been positive across most business lines (in particular in auto where we have seen a large number of double digit increases as we have remediated underpriced business through a combination of product exits and use of reinsurance). The current accident year deterioration has seen partial offsets as a result of actions taken in 2016 to grow higher value lines such as M&A and Cyber.\n",
      "Liability and Financial Lines has large international exposure within the total Commercial Insurance portfolio and will therefore remain sensitive to volatility in foreign currencies.\n",
      "Property and Special Risks\n",
      "In 2016, Property and Special Risks experienced growth in certain strategic high value businesses that led to positive results that met or exceeded our expectations, including U.S. middle market property, and we expect such growth to continue in 2017. The U.S. large limit property business continues to be a profitable investment area, and remains at volumes consistent with 2015. Property and Special Risks also expects that expansion in certain growth economies will continue at a faster pace than in developed countries, but at levels lower than those previously expected due to revised economic assumptions. Rates in more commoditized lines of business such as U.S. Excess and Surplus lines continue to be unsatisfactory and we intend to continue to reduce our net premiums written in these areas.\n",
      "Overall, Property and Special Risks experienced rate pressure in 2016, which is expected to continue in the near term, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Property and Special Risks continues to differentiate its underwriting capacity from its peers by leveraging its global footprint, diverse product offering, risk engineering expertise and significant underwriting experience.\n",
      "Primarily due to reductions in the Property portfolio driven by actions to address accounts with inadequate price and/or terms and conditions, catastrophe exposures have declined.\n",

      "The net premiums written decrease in 2016 was driven by the Swiss Re quota share treaty, portfolio optimization and execution on our pricing strategy, partially offset by growth in targeted lines of business. The increase in net losses was driven by net adverse prior year reserve development. The acquisition expense decrease was primarily related to the 2016 Swiss Re quota share treaty. The general operating expense decrease was driven by lower employee-related expenses and other expense savings initiatives. Lower net investment income was driven primarily by lower alternative investment returns due to weaker performance in equity markets compared to prior years.\n",
      "We continue to reduce the relative size of our U.S. casualty portfolio within Liability and Financial Lines and consequently expect that net premiums written will continue to decline through 2017, in large part driven by the impact of our continued strategy on risk selection, disciplined underwriting and execution of our reinsurance strategy to further reduce risk.\n",
      "As discussed in the Executive Summary, in January 2017, we entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO, which covers 80 percent of up to $9 billion of potential future prior year development on substantially all of our U.S. Casualty and Financial Lines exposures for accident years 2015 and prior. Under U.S. GAAP, any potential future prior year development would be recognized immediately as losses are incurred; however, the related recoveries under the reinsurance agreement would be deferred and recognized over the expected recovery period.\n",

      "The net premiums written decrease in 2016 was driven by portfolio optimization and continued challenging market conditions, coupled with a decrease of assumed premiums related to the 50 percent quota share reinsurance agreement with United Guaranty. This quota share reinsurance agreement contributed $146 million and $86 million to pre-tax operating income in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in net losses and loss ratio were driven by higher catastrophes and higher net adverse prior year loss reserve development, partially offset by lower severe losses. The expense ratio increase was mainly driven by business mix shift and premium reduction, which more than offset expense reduction. Lower net investment income was driven primarily by lower alternative investment returns due to weaker performance in equity markets compared to prior years.\n",

      "Individual Retirement\n",
      "Increasing life expectancy and reduced expectations for traditional retirement income from defined benefit programs and fixed income securities are leading Americans to seek additional financial security as they approach retirement. The strong demand for individual variable and fixed index annuities with guaranteed income features has attracted increased competition in this product space. In response to the continued low interest rate environment, which has added pressure to profit margins, we have developed guaranteed income benefits for both variable and fixed index annuities with margins that are less sensitive to the level of interest rates.\n",
      "Changes in the interest rate environment have a significant impact on sales, surrender rates, investment returns, guaranteed income features, and spreads in the annuity industry. See AIG’s Outlook - Industry and Economic Factors - Changes in the Interest Rate Environment for additional discussion of the impact of market interest rate movement on our Individual Retirement business.\n",

VALIC is a leading retirement plan provider in the U.S. for K-12 schools and school districts, higher education, healthcare, government and other not-for-profit institutions.

VALIC’s service model pairs self-service tools with its career financial advisors who provide individual plan participants with enrollment support and comprehensive financial planning services.\n",

Business - Regulation.\n",
      "Life Insurance\n",
      "Consumers have increased needs for financial protection for beneficiaries, estate planning and wealth creation. Life Insurance addresses the need for protection against the risk of premature death through a broad spectrum of products that include both term and permanent life insurance. In addition, Life Insurance offers products and benefits that offset other risks such as chronic and critical illness.\n",
      "In response to a sustained low interest rate environment, Life Insurance has been actively re-pricing products and shifting its focus away from products with long-duration interest rate guarantees by introducing new products with shorter guarantees as well as indexed universal life products. See AIG’s Outlook -Industry and Economic Factors - Changes in the Interest Rate Environment for additional discussion of the impact of market interest rate movement on our Life Insurance business.\n",
      "Personal Insurance\n",
      "The need for full life cycle products and coverage, increases in personal wealth accumulation, and awareness of insurance protection and risk management continue to support the growth of the Personal Insurance industry. Personal Insurance focuses on group and corporate clients, together with individual customers within national markets. We expect the demand for multinational cross-border coverage and services to increase due to the internationalization of clients and customers. We believe our global presence provides Personal Insurance a distinct competitive advantage.\n",
      "In Japan, the competition for auto insurance has intensified, in part driven by a decline in new car sales and the existence of fewer but larger insurers. In addition, the overall market size in homeowners insurance contracted after the duration restriction on long-term fire insurance became effective in October 2015. In the U.S., we compete in the high net worth market and will continue to expand our innovative products and services to distribution partners and clients. Outside of Japan and the U.S., our Personal Insurance module continues to invest selectively in markets, which we believe have higher potential for sustainable profitability.\n",

      "A diverse product portfolio enabled Individual Retirement to maintain industry-leading positions in annuity sales despite a challenging environment, which included an industry-wide slowdown primarily driven by uncertainty about the DOL Fiduciary Rule, compared to strong Variable and Index Annuity sales growth in 2015 and 2014. Our total sales of Index Annuities slowed in 2016 but continued to outpace the industry. Fixed Annuities sales increased in 2016 as customers chose the safety of fixed returns in a period of equity volatility, but the sustained low interest rate environment, together with aggressive pricing by private equity-backed annuity writers, resulted in a modest decline in market share in 2016 and negative net flows for Fixed Annuities in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Reinvestment in the low interest rate environment contributed to spread compression in Fixed Annuities, and net investment income results included volatility from alternative investments, mortgage loan prepayments, and fair value option assets. Pre-tax operating income also included adjustments in each year to update actuarial assumptions, particularly from lower surrenders across all product lines. Excluding such adjustments, net growth in average assets for Variable and Index Annuities drove higher fee income, partially offset by increased DAC amortization. The sale of AIG Advisor Group in May 2016 resulted in decreases in advisory fee income, advisory fee expense and general operating expenses in 2016 compared to 2015, but did not result in a significant decrease in pre-tax operating income.\n",

The increase in the amount and proportion of annuity reserves that have no surrender charge at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 was primarily due to normal aging of this book of business, as well as lower than expected surrenders of older contracts with higher minimum interest rates on fixed account balances that have continued to be attractive to the contract holders in the low interest rate environment. For Variable and Index Annuities, the increase in reserves with higher surrender charges during these periods was due to positive net flows from these product lines during 2016. The increase in the amount of reserves within the surrender charge period, as well as uncertainty around the DOL Fiduciary Rule, drove the improvement in the surrender rate in 2016 and 2015.\n",

We acquired AIG Life Limited in the UK in December 2014, and sales growth with early year losses in this young organization has contributed to the pre-tax operating losses in Life Insurance.

      "• During 2016, we reduced our hedge fund portfolio by $3.2 billion as a result of redemptions consistent with our planned reduction of exposure. Our alternative investments portfolio performance also experienced a decline in 2016 due to increased volatility in equity markets, primarily in the first quarter of 2016.\n",
      "• Blended investment yields on new investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called.\n",
      "• Other-than-temporary impairments decreased due to lower impairments in our equity securities, available for sale.\n",
      "• We recognized gains on sales of securities in 2016, primarily due to the sale of a portion of our PICC Investment.\n",
      "• The U.S. election and Brexit vote have created increased volatility in credit markets and exchange rates as well as within the equity markets, which may continue for some time.\n",
      "Investment Strategies\n",
      "Investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local and general market conditions, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification.\n",
      "Some of our key investment strategies are as follows:\n",
      "• Fixed maturity securities held by the U.S. insurance companies included in Property Casualty Insurance Companies consist of a mix of instruments that meet our current risk-return, tax, liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectives.\n",
      "• Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by Property Casualty Insurance Companies consist primarily of high-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.\n",
      "• While more of a focus is placed on asset-liability management in Life Insurance Companies, our fundamental strategy across all of our investment portfolios is to optimize the duration characteristics of the assets within a target range based on comparable liability characteristics, to the extent practicable.\n",
      "• AIG Parent, included in Other Operations, actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities. Based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchases publicly traded, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity.\n",

      "The following table presents the components of Net Investment Income:\n",
      "(a) Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, the presentation of income on alternative investments has been refined to include only income from hedge funds, private equity funds and affordable housing partnerships. Prior period disclosures have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. Hedge funds for which we elected the fair value option are recorded as of the balance sheet date. Other hedge funds are generally reported on a one-month lag, while private equity funds are generally reported on a one-quarter lag.\n",

For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the net investment income (loss) recorded on these securities was $120 million, $(43) million and $260 million, respectively.\n",
      "Net investment income in 2016 was marginally higher than 2015 as lower income on alternative investments and lower reinvestment yields were approximately offset by an increase in income on life settlements and higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected.\n",
      "Net investment income decreased for 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower income on alternative investments, primarily related to hedge fund performance, lower income on assets for which the fair value option was elected, and lower reinvestment yields.\n",
      "Attribution of Net Investment Income to Product Lines\n",
      "Net investment income is attributed to our businesses based on internal models consistent with the nature of the underlying businesses.\n",
      "For Commercial Insurance - Liability and Financial Lines, Property and Special Risks and Consumer Insurance - Personal Insurance, we estimate investable funds based primarily on loss reserves and unearned premiums. The allocation of net investment income of the Property Casualty Insurance Companies to modules is calculated based on these estimated investable funds, consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities and the capital allocation for each module.\n",
      "For Consumer Insurance - Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, and Life Insurance, Other Operations - Institutional Markets and Legacy Life Insurance Run-Off Lines, net investment income is attributed based on invested assets from segregated product line portfolios held in our Life Insurance Companies. All invested assets of the Life Insurance Companies in excess of liabilities are allocated based on estimates of required economic capital for each product line.\n",
      "Asset Liability Measurement\n",
      "For the Property Casualty Insurance Companies, the duration of liabilities for long-tail casualty lines is greater than that of other lines. As a result, the investment strategy within the Property Casualty Insurance Companies focuses on growth of surplus and preservation of capital, subject to liability and other business considerations.\n",
      "The Property Casualty Insurance Companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies and also invest in structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans. While invested assets backing reserves of the Property Casualty Insurance Companies are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities, we have continued to allocate a portion of our investment activity into asset classes that offer higher yields, particularly in the domestic operations. In addition, we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset-backed investments for their risk-return attributes, as well as to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates. This asset diversification has maintained stable average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity securities were largely unchanged. We expect to continue to pursue this investment strategy to meet the Property Casualty Insurance Companies’ liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives.\n",
      "In addition, the Property Casualty Insurance Companies seek to enhance returns through selective investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio.\n",
      "Fixed maturity investments of the Property Casualty Insurance Companies domestic operations, with an average duration of 4.7 years, are currently comprised primarily of tax-exempt securities, which provide attractive risk-adjusted after-tax returns, as well as\n",

      "The investment strategy of the Life Insurance Companies is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value, subject to liquidity requirements, capital constraints, diversification requirements, asset-liability management and available investment opportunities.\n",
      "The Life Insurance Companies use asset-liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses. The Life Insurance Companies' fundamental investment strategy is to maintain a diversified, high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities that, to the extent practicable, complements the characteristics of liabilities, including duration, which is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities, and as a result, certain portfolios are shorter in duration and others are longer in duration. An extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses, which may require us to further extend the duration of the investment portfolio.\n",
      "The Life Insurance Companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans.\n",
      "In addition, the Life Insurance Companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields. While a diversified portfolio of alternative investments remains a fundamental component of the investment strategy of the Life Insurance Companies, we intend to reduce the overall size of the hedge fund portfolio, in light of changing market conditions and perceived market opportunities, and to continue reducing the size of the private equity portfolio.\n",
      "Fixed maturity investments of the Life Insurance Companies domestic operations, with an average duration of 6.8 years, are comprised primarily of taxable corporate bonds, as well as taxable municipal and government bonds, and agency and non-agency structured securities.

      "NAIC Designations of Fixed Maturity Securities\n",
      "The Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the National Association of Insurance Companies (NAIC) evaluates the investments of U.S. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called ‘NAIC Designations.’ In general, NAIC Designations of ‘1’ highest quality, or ‘2’ high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while NAIC Designations of ‘3’ through ‘6’ generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade. The NAIC has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities, including non-agency RMBS and CMBS, which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses to better determine the appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities. These methodologies result in an improved NAIC Designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. The following tables summarize the ratings distribution of U.S. Insurance Companies fixed maturity security portfolio by NAIC Designation, and the distribution by composite AIG credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies. See Investments - Credit Ratings herein for a full description of the composite AIG credit ratings.\n",

Approximately 17 percent of these securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies, and approximately 17 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated. Our investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services’ ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis.\n",
      "Moody’s Investors’ Service Inc. (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&P Global Inc. (S&P), or similar foreign rating services rate a significant portion of our foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio. Rating services are not available for some foreign-issued securities. Our Credit Risk Management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio’s non-rated fixed maturity securities. At December 31, 2016, approximately 19 percent of such investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of our internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated AAA, and approximately 8 percent were below investment grade or not rated. Approximately 36 percent of the foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio is comprised of sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance.\n",

We responded by increasing expected loss ratios for U.S. Excess Casualty, U.S. Other Casualty, International Liability and Financial Lines and U.S. Workers’ Compensation. In addition, our updated assumptions for bad-faith claims and unallocated loss adjustment expenses disproportionately impacted these years.\n",
      "• Accident years 2006 to 2010 - adverse development of $846 million were largely impacted by updated loss development selections in U.S. Financial Lines and revised estimates on expected future recoveries from risk-sharing policies in the U.S. Workers’ Compensation business.\n",
      "• Accident years 2005 and prior - adverse development of $1.7 billion was driven by U.S. Excess Casualty revised tail factor selections, updated loss development selections for various U.S. Run-off Casualty Insurance Lines, including updated industry experience for asbestos and revised estimates on expected future recoveries from risk-sharing policies.\n",

      "• Accident years 2006 to 2010 - adverse development of $2 million were driven by U.S. Financial lines and U.S. Excess Casualty.\n",
      "• Accident years 2005 and prior - adverse development of $1.0 billion was driven by the U.S. Excess Casualty results of the mass-tort segmentation analysis, the updated U.S. Workers’ Compensation development selections (principally in California, New York and the excess of deductible segments) as well as the U.S. Run-Off Casualty Insurance Lines pollution products business (1987-2004) and the asbestos and environmental (1986 and prior) exposure.\n",

      "On January 20, 2017, we entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., under which we transferred to NICO 80 percent of the reserve risk on substantially all of our U.S. Commercial long-tail exposures for accident years 2015 and prior. Under this agreement, we ceded to NICO 80 percent of the paid losses on subject business paid on or after January 1, 2016 in excess of $25 billion of net paid losses, up to an aggregate limit of $25 billion. At NICO’s 80 percent share, NICO’s limit of liability under the contract is $20 billion. We will account for this transaction as retroactive reinsurance. The consideration for this agreement is $9.8 billion plus interest at 4 percent per annum from January 1, 2016 to date of payment, which was paid in full as of February 17, 2017. The consideration paid to NICO will be placed into a collateral trust account as security for NICO’s claim payment obligations, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has provided a parental guarantee to secure the obligations of NICO under the agreement.\n",

The agreement is expected to result in lower capital charges for reserve risks at our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. Under U.S. GAAP, any potential future prior year development would be recognized immediately as losses are incurred; however, the related recoveries under the reinsurance agreement would be deferred and recognized over the expected recovery period. In addition, we would expect future net investment income to decline as a result of lower invested assets.\n",

Estimated gross profit assumptions include net investment income and spreads, net realized capital gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses, and mortality gains and losses. If the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC and related reserves (which may include VOBA, SIA, guaranteed benefit reserves and unearned revenue reserves) are recalculated using the new assumptions, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. Updating such assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products. The update of actuarial assumptions in 2016, 2015 and 2014 also included adjustments to reserves for universal life with secondary guarantees.\n",
      "The update of actuarial assumptions in 2016, 2015 and 2014 included adjustments for products now reported in the Legacy Portfolio, primarily loss recognition expense related to pre-2010 payout annuities and certain long-term care products.

      "In Fixed Annuities, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net positive adjustment of $330 million in 2016, which reflected lower surrender assumptions, primarily due to lower long-term interest rates, as well as updates to investment yield and crediting rate assumptions compared to those previously modeled. In 2015, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions in Fixed Annuities resulted in a net positive adjustment of $92 million, which reflected refinements to investment spread assumptions, lower terminations than previously assumed and decreases to expense assumptions. In 2014, a net positive adjustment of $196 million in Fixed Annuities was primarily due to better spreads than previously assumed.\n",

      "In Variable and Index Annuities, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net positive adjustment of $39 million in 2016, primarily due to favorable updates to assumptions for long-term volatility, surrenders, mortality and policy expenses, partially offset by a decrease in the separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption from 8.5 percent to 7.5 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected). The net positive adjustment in 2016 included a net negative adjustment of approximately $24 million in connection with the conversion to a more robust modeling platform for variable annuities, primarily due to refinements to assumptions for guaranteed minimum interest rates and investment fees, partially offset by the impact of other refinements identified during the conversion. In 2015, there were offsetting updates to assumed investment fees, modeled expenses, and terminations, resulting in no net adjustment to pre-tax operating income in Variable and Index Annuities compared to a $4 million net positive adjustment in 2014, which reflected the update of estimated gross profit assumptions.\n",
      "Group Retirement\n",
      "In Group Retirement, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net negative adjustment of $47 million in 2016, primarily due to refinements in surrender and partial withdrawal assumptions and a decrease in the separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption from 8.5 percent to 7.5 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected). In 2015, a net positive adjustment from the update of estimated gross profit assumptions of $48 million in Group Retirement was primarily due to revisions to mortality and surrender assumptions, partially offset by decreased spread assumptions. In 2014, a net positive adjustment of $46 million in Group Retirement was primarily due to more favorable assumptions for investment spreads and surrenders than previously assumed.\n",
      "Life Insurance\n",
      "In Life Insurance, the update of actuarial assumptions resulted in a net negative adjustment of $92 million in 2016. This adjustment was primarily due to refinement to reserves for universal life insurance with secondary guarantees due to lower assumed surrender rates. The update to Life Insurance assumptions also included lower yield and interest credited assumptions.\n",
      "In 2015, the net negative adjustment of $118 million related to the update of actuarial assumptions in Life Insurance was primarily due to lower assumed surrender rates for certain later-duration universal life with secondary guarantees. The net negative adjustment also reflected lower investment spread assumptions, partially offset by more favorable than expected mortality.\n",
      "A net negative adjustment of $32 million in Life Insurance in 2014 was primarily due to additions to reserves for universal life with secondary guarantees, as a result of lower investment spread and mortality assumptions which, while higher than previously assumed, were still within pricing assumptions.\n",
      "Legacy Portfolio\n",
      "The update of actuarial assumptions resulted in $622 million of loss recognition expense in 2016 on payout annuities in the Legacy Life Insurance Run-Off Lines. The loss recognition reflected the establishment of additional reserves primarily as a result of mortality experience studies, which indicated increased longevity, particularly on injured lives on a block of structured settlements underwritten prior to 2010. The mortality assumption update did not impact reserves for structured settlements and terminal funding annuities written after April 2012, which are in the Institutional Markets business.\n",
      "Legacy Life Insurance Run-Off Lines recorded loss recognition expense of $28 million and $87 million to increase reserves for certain long-term care business in 2015 and 2014, respectively, which reduced pre-tax operating income in those periods. The loss recognition for both periods was primarily a result of lower future premium increase assumptions and, in 2014, lower yield assumptions.\n",

      "Differences in Valuation of Embedded Derivatives and Economic Hedge Target\n",
      "The variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents an estimate of the underlying economic risks in our GMWB riders. The economic hedge target differs from the U.S. GAAP valuation of the GMWB embedded derivatives due to the following:\n",
      "• The economic hedge target includes 100 percent of rider fees in present value calculations; the U.S. GAAP valuation reflects only those fees attributed to the embedded derivative such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero;\n",
      "• The economic hedge target uses best estimate actuarial assumptions and excludes explicit risk margins used for U.S. GAAP valuation, such as margins for policyholder behavior, mortality, and volatility; and\n",
      "• The economic hedge target excludes the non-performance or “own credit” risk adjustment (NPA) used in the U.S. GAAP valuation, which reflects a market participant’s view of our claims-paying ability by incorporating an additional spread (the NPA spread) to the swap curve used to discount projected benefit cash flows. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our valuation methodology for embedded derivatives within policyholder contract deposits. Because the discount rate includes the NPA spread and other explicit risk margins, the U.S. GAAP valuation is generally less sensitive to movements in interest rates and other market factors, and to changes from actuarial assumption updates, than the economic hedge target.\n",
      "The market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting. In addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program, the Life Insurance Companies have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees. The primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include:\n",
      "• Basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns, which may be either positive or negative;\n",
      "• Realized volatility versus implied volatility;\n",
      "• Actual versus expected changes in the hedge target driven by assumptions not subject to hedging, particularly policyholder behavior; and\n",
      "• Risk exposures that we have elected not to explicitly or fully hedge.\n",
      "The following table presents a reconciliation between the fair value of the U.S. GAAP embedded derivatives and the value of our economic hedge target:\n",
      "Impact on Pre-tax Income (Loss)\n",
      "The impact on our pre-tax income (loss) of the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits and related hedging results include changes in the fair value of the GMWB embedded derivatives, and changes in the fair value of related derivative hedging instruments, both of which are recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses). Realized capital gains (losses), as well as net investment income from changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities used in the hedging program, are excluded from pre-tax operating income of Individual Retirement and Group Retirement.\n",
      "The change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and the change in the value of the hedging portfolio are not expected to be fully offsetting, primarily due to the differences in valuation between the economic hedge target, the U.S. GAAP embedded derivatives, and changes in the fair value of the hedging portfolio, as discussed above. When corporate credit spreads widen, the change in the NPA spread generally reduces the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a gain, and when corporate credit spreads narrow or tighten, the change in the NPA spread generally increases the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a loss. In addition to changes driven by credit market-related movements in the NPA spread, the NPA balance also reflects changes in business activity and in the net amount at risk from the underlying guaranteed living benefits.\n",

      "The net impact on pre-tax income from the GMWB and related hedges in 2016 (excluding related DAC amortization) was primarily driven by actuarial assumption updates to surrender and mortality assumptions. The 2015 and 2014 net impacts were primarily driven by changes in the NPA spread. In addition, the impact of rising interest rates and equity markets late in the fourth quarter of 2016 resulted in fair value losses in the hedging portfolio, which were not offset by decreases in the embedded derivative liabilities, because risk margins and other assumptions used for U.S. GAAP valuation cause the embedded derivatives to be less sensitive to changes in market rates than the hedge portfolio.

      "Change in Economic Hedge Target\n",
      "The increase in the economic hedge target in 2016 was primarily due to the update of actuarial assumptions offset by reductions from positive equity markets and increases in market interest rates, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2016. A decrease in market interest rates, lower equity market performance and the update of actuarial assumptions in 2015 resulted in increases in economic hedge target, which were significantly offset by changes in the value of the hedging portfolio. The increases in the economic hedge target in 2014 were primarily due to declines in interest rates and the update of actuarial assumptions, partially offset by higher equity market returns.\n",
      "Change in Fair Value of the Hedging Portfolio\n",
      "The changes in the fair value of the economic hedge target and, to a lesser extent, the embedded derivatives, were offset in part by the following changes in the fair value of the variable annuity hedging portfolio:\n",
      "• Changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities, for which the fair value option has been elected, are used as a capital-efficient way to economically hedge interest rate and credit spread-related risk. Effective June 30, 2015, we discontinued our U.S. Treasury bond interest rate hedging program and initiated a corporate bond hedging program, which is intended to provide the same capital efficiency as the previous U.S. Treasury bond hedging program. The change in the fair value of the corporate bond hedging program in 2016 included gains, primarily due to credit spreads tightening and decreases in market interest rates in the first nine months of 2016, partially offset by an increase in rates in the fourth quarter of 2016. The change in the fair value of the corporate bond hedging program in 2015 reflected losses, primarily due to increases in market interest rates in the first six months of 2015 and credit spreads widening. The gains in 2014 from the change in the fair value of the fixed maturities securities were due to decreases in market interest rates in 2014. The change in the fair value of the hedging bonds, which is excluded from the pre-tax operating income of the Individual Retirement and Group Retirement segments, is reported in net investment income on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).\n",
      "• Changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative contracts, which included swaps, swaptions and futures, resulted in net losses in 2016 as increases in rates in the fourth quarter of 2016 more than offset the impact of interest rate declines in the first nine months of 2016. The net gains in 2015 on interest rate contracts reflected decreases in market interest rates in the latter half of 2015, partially offset by the impact of increases in rates in the first six months of 2015. In 2014, rates declined throughout the year, resulting in gains from interest rate derivative contracts.\n",

      "Update of Actuarial Assumptions\n",
      "The change in embedded derivatives included increases in 2016 due to the update of actuarial assumptions, which primarily reflected lower surrender and mortality assumptions, partially offset by a decrease due to updated assumptions for utilization of withdrawal benefits. The impact of these updated assumptions, which were based on experience studies, was less significant to the embedded derivative liabilities than to the economic hedge target, because the discount rates used to value the embedded derivatives include the additional adjustment for the NPA spread, as well as other explicit risk margins. In addition, the increase in the embedded derivative liabilities from the assumption updates was largely offset by a reduction due to an update of these risk margins.

The five-year reversion to the mean period has not met the criteria for adjustment in 2016, 2015 or 2014; however, sustained favorable equity market performance in excess of long-term assumptions could result in unlocking in the Individual Retirement or Group Retirement variable annuity product lines in the future, with a positive effect on pre-tax income in the period of the unlocking.

Shadow DAC generally moves in the opposite direction of the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, reducing the reported DAC balance when market interest rates decline. Market interest rates as of December 31, 2016 decreased compared to December 31, 2015 as a result of narrowing spreads in 2016. As a result, the unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity securities held in the Life Insurance Companies that support the Core Portfolio businesses at December 31, 2016 increased by $2.1 billion compared to December 31, 2015, which resulted in a decrease in DAC to reflect the shadow DAC adjustment.\n",

      "Liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet our payment obligations. It is defined as cash and unencumbered assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost. We manage our liquidity prudently through various risk committees, policies and procedures, and a stress testing and liquidity risk framework established by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Our liquidity risk framework is designed to manage liquidity at both AIG Parent and subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six-months under a liquidity stress scenario. See Enterprise Risk Management - Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement and Enterprise Risk Management - Liquidity Risk Management below for additional information.\n",
      "Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. Our primary source of ongoing capital generation is the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. We must comply with numerous constraints on our minimum capital positions. These constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy for both AIG and the individual businesses and are based on internally-defined risk tolerances, regulatory requirements, rating agency and creditor expectations and business needs. Actual capital levels are monitored on a regular basis, and using ERM’s stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital impact of potential macroeconomic, financial and insurance stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraints of both AIG and our insurance subsidiaries.\n",
      "We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events.\n",
      "Nevertheless, some circumstances may cause our cash or capital needs to exceed projected liquidity or readily deployable capital resources as was the case in 2008. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash or capital needs and loss of sources of liquidity and capital. In addition, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.\n",
      "Depending on market conditions, regulatory and rating agency considerations and other factors, we may take various liability and capital management actions. Liability management actions may include, but are not limited to, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers. Capital management actions may include, but are not limited to, paying dividends to our shareholders and share repurchases.\n",

      "AIG Parent\n",
      "As of December 31, 2016, AIG Parent had approximately $12.9 billion in liquidity sources. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities primarily include U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. Based upon an assessment of funding needs, the liquidity sources can be readily monetized through sales, repurchase agreements or contributed as admitted assets to regulated insurance companies. AIG Parent liquidity is monitored through the use of various internal liquidity risk measures. AIG Parent’s primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from subsidiaries and credit facilities. AIG Parent’s primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, and operating expenses.\n",
      "We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy our reasonably foreseeable future requirements and meet our obligations to our creditors, debt-holders and insurance company subsidiaries. We expect to access the debt markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed.\n",
      "We utilize our capital resources to support our businesses, with the majority of capital allocated to our insurance operations. Should we have or generate more capital than is needed to support our business strategies (including organic growth or acquisition opportunities) or mitigate risks inherent to our business, we may develop plans to distribute such capital to shareholders via dividends or share repurchase authorizations or deploy such capital towards liability management.\n",
      "In the normal course, it is expected that a portion of the capital released by our insurance operations or through the utilization of AIG’s deferred tax assets may be available for distribution to shareholders. Additionally, it is expected that a portion of the capital associated\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K 136\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Liquidity and Capital Resources\n",
      "with businesses or investments that do not directly support our insurance operations may be available for distribution to shareholders or deployment towards liability management upon its monetization.\n",
      "In developing plans to distribute capital, AIG considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to: AIG’s business and strategic plans, expectations for capital generation and utilization, AIG’s funding capacity and capital resources in comparison to internal benchmarks, as well as rating agency expectations, regulatory standards and internal stress tests for capital.\n",
      "In January 2016, AIG Parent made a capital contribution of approximately $2.9 billion to our Property Casualty Insurance Companies as a result of our fourth quarter 2015 reserve strengthening.\n",
      "The following table presents AIG Parent's liquidity sources:\n",
      "(a) Cash and short-term investments include reverse repurchase agreements totaling $1.0 billion and $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n",

      "Insurance Companies\n",
      "We expect that our insurance companies will be able to continue to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. Our insurance companies’ liquidity resources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.\n",
      "Each of our material insurance companies’ liquidity is monitored through various internal liquidity risk measures. The primary sources of liquidity are premiums, fees, reinsurance recoverables and investment income. The primary uses of liquidity are paid losses, reinsurance payments, benefit claims, surrenders, withdrawals, interest payments, dividends, expenses, investments and collateral requirements.\n",
      "Our Property Casualty Insurance Companies may require additional funding to meet capital or liquidity needs under certain circumstances. Large catastrophes may require us to provide additional support to our affected operations. Downgrades in our credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, which could result in non-renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the subsidiary’s ability to meet its own obligations. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital. Other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include an economic collapse of a nation or region significant to our operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval.\n",
      "AIG Parent and Ascot Corporate Name Limited (ACNL) were previously parties to a $725 million letter of credit facility. The letter of credit facility was released at the closing of AIG’s sale of its interest in Ascot Underwriting Holdings Ltd. and ACNL in November 2016.\n",
      "Management believes that because of the size and liquidity of our Life Insurance Companies’ investment portfolios, normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience would not create significant liquidity risk. Furthermore, our Life Insurance Companies’ products contain certain features that mitigate surrender risk, including surrender charges. However, as we saw in 2008, in times of extreme capital markets disruption, liquidity needs could outpace resources. As part of their risk management framework, our Life Insurance Companies continue to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue strategies and programs to improve their liquidity position and facilitate their ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio.\n",
      "Certain of our U.S. insurance companies are members of the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) in their respective districts. Borrowings from the FHLBs are used to supplement liquidity or for other uses deemed appropriate by management. Our U.S. Property Casualty Insurance Companies had outstanding borrowings from the FHLBs in an aggregate amount of approximately $733 million and zero at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The outstanding borrowings are being used primarily for interest rate risk management purposes in connection with certain reinsurance arrangements, and the balances are expected to decline as underlying premiums are collected.

      "Certain of our U.S. Life Insurance Companies have programs, which began in 2012, that lend securities from their investment portfolio to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management. Under these programs, these U.S. Life Insurance Companies lend securities to financial institutions and receive cash as collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. Cash collateral received is invested in short-term investments. Additionally, the aggregate amount of securities that a Life Insurance Company is able to lend under its program at any time is limited to five percent of its general account statutory-basis admitted assets. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our U.S. Life Insurance Companies had $2.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, of securities subject to these agreements and $2.5 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, of liabilities to borrowers for collateral received.\n",
      "AIG generally manages capital between AIG Parent and our insurance companies through internal, Board-approved policies and limits, as well as management standards. In addition, AIG Parent has unconditional capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) in place with certain subsidiaries. Nevertheless, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer capital freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.\n",
      "AIG Parent is party to a CMA with AGC Life Insurance Company. Among other things, the CMA provides that AIG Parent will maintain the total adjusted capital of AGC Life Insurance Company at or above a specified minimum percentage of its projected NAIC Company Action Level Risk-Based Capital (RBC). As of December 31, 2016, the specified minimum percentage under this CMA was 250 percent. AIG Parent terminated the CMA with United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company in connection with the December 2016 closing of the sale of UGC.\n",

      "In 2016, our U.S. Life Insurance Companies paid approximately $4.7 billion of dividends and loan repayments in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities to AIG Parent, which included the release of approximately $1.0 billion of excess statutory capital resulting from a reinsurance agreement entered into by one of the Life Insurance Companies involving certain of its whole life and universal life businesses, effective July 1, 2016. The fixed maturity securities primarily included U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. The reinsurance agreement also resulted in a $49 million tax payment to AIG Parent. Effective December 31, 2016, the same life subsidiary recaptured certain term and universal life reserves previously ceded to an affiliate and ceded approximately $14 billion of such statutory reserves to an unaffiliated reinsurer under an amendment to the July 1, 2016 agreement, which is expected to result in a tax payment to AIG Parent of approximately $2.3 billion in 2017.\n",

      "As of December 31, 2016, a total of $4.5 billion remains available under the Facility. Our ability to borrow under the Facility is not contingent on our credit ratings. However, our ability to borrow under the Facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the Facility. These include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the Facility would restrict our access to the Facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

      "Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "Risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns. We consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance.\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "We have an integrated process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm-wide risk appetite. Our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of AIG’s major risk positions. Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM. ERM supports our businesses and management in the embedding of risk management in our key day-to-day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing, monitoring and reporting, and mitigating the risks taken by us and our businesses. Nevertheless, our risk management efforts may not always be successful and material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or financial condition may occur.\n",
      "Risk Governance Structure\n",
      "Our risk governance structure fosters the development and maintenance of a risk and control culture that encompasses all significant risk categories. Accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit. We review our governance and committee structure on a regular basis and make changes as appropriate to continue to effectively manage and govern our risks and risk-taking.\n",
      "Our Board of Directors oversees the management of risk through its Risk and Capital Committee (RCC) and Audit Committee. Those committees regularly interact with other committees of the Board of Directors. Our Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reports to both the RCC and our Chief Executive Officer (CEO).\n",
      "The Group Risk Committee (GRC): The GRC is the senior management group responsible for assessing all significant risk issues on a global basis to protect our financial strength, optimize our intrinsic value, and protect our reputation. The GRC is chaired by our CRO. Its membership includes our CEO, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and other executives from across our corporate functions and business units. Our CRO reports periodically on behalf of the GRC to both the RCC and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Our CRO is also a member of the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) providing ERM the opportunity to contribute to, review, monitor and consider the impact of changes in strategy.\n",
      "Management committees that support the GRC are described below. These committees are comprised of senior executives and experienced business representatives from a range of functions and business units throughout AIG and its subsidiaries. These committees are charged with identifying, analyzing and reviewing specific risk matters within their respective mandates.\n",
      "Financial Risk Group (FRG): The FRG is responsible for the oversight of financial risks taken by AIG and our subsidiaries. Its mandate includes overseeing our aggregate credit, market, interest rate, capital, liquidity and model risks, as well as asset-liability management, derivatives activity, and foreign exchange transactions. It provides the primary corporate-level review function for all proposed transactions and business practices that are significant in size, complex in scope, or that present heightened legal, reputational, accounting or regulatory risks. The FRG is chaired by our CRO. Membership of the FRG also includes our CFO, Chief Investment Officer (CIO) and Treasurer.\n",
      "Technology, Operational Risk & Control Committee (TORCC): This committee oversees technology and operational risk management and control issues and activities across our businesses, functions, and geographic locations. The TORCC reviews our risk management practices and monitors current and emerging technology and operational risks, as well as management actions taken to reduce risks to acceptable levels. It primarily focuses on establishing the firm-wide framework for identifying, measuring, quantifying, and managing and mitigating technology and operational risks, and monitoring our controls. The TORCC addresses firm-wide, rather than business-specific issues and is mandated to prioritize technology and operational improvements that are significant and transformational. The TORCC also provides a forum for senior management to assess our technology and operational risk profiles that may affect our strategic objectives.\n",

      "Business Unit Risk Committees: Each of our major insurance businesses has established a risk committee that serves as the senior management committee responsible for risk oversight at the individual business unit level. The risk committees are responsible for the identification, assessment and monitoring of all sources of risk within their respective portfolios. Specific responsibilities include setting risk tolerances, reviewing the capital allocation framework, insurance portfolio optimization, and providing oversight of risk-adjusted metrics. In addition, each business unit has established subordinate committees at the legal entity level and working groups in place that support these committees in executing their duties, such as ensuring policies are adhered to, and transactions are completed with risk appetite in mind. Together, these committees provide comprehensive risk oversight throughout the organization.\n",
      "Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement\n",
      "Risk Appetite Framework\n",
      "Our Risk Appetite Framework integrates stakeholder interests, strategic business goals and available financial resources. We balance these by seeking to take measured risks that are expected to generate repeatable, sustainable earnings and create long-term value for our shareholders. The framework includes our risk appetite statement approved by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof and a set of supporting tools, including risk tolerances, risk limits and policies, which we use to manage our risk profile and financial resources.\n",
      "We articulate our aggregate risk-taking by setting risk tolerances and thresholds on capital and liquidity measures. These measures are set at the AIG Parent level as well as the legal entity level and cover consolidated and insurance company capital and liquidity ratios. We must comply with standards for capital adequacy and maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all our obligations as they come due in accordance with our internal capital management and liquidity policies. Our risk tolerances take into consideration regulatory requirements, rating agency expectations, and business needs. The GRC routinely reviews the level of risk taken by the consolidated\n",

      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "organization in relation to the established risk tolerances. A consolidated risk report is also presented periodically, as required, to the RCC by our CRO.\n",
      "Risk Limits\n",
      "A key component of our Risk Appetite Framework is having a process in place that establishes and maintains appropriate limits on the material risks identified for our core businesses and facilitates monitoring and meeting of both internal and external stakeholder expectations. Our objectives include:\n",
      "• Establishing risk monitoring, provide early warning indicators, and ensure timely oversight and enforceability of limits;\n",
      "• Defining a consistent and transparent approach to limits governance; and\n",
      "• Aligning our business activities with our risk appetite statement.\n",
      "To support the monitoring and management of AIG’s and its business units’ material risks, ERM has an established limits framework that employs a three-tiered hierarchy:\n",
      "• Board level risk tolerances are AIG’s aggregate capital and liquidity limits. They define the minimum level of capital and liquidity that we should maintain. These board level risk tolerances require our RCC approval.\n",
      "• AIG management level limits are risk type specific limits at the AIG consolidated level. These limits are defined and calibrated to constrain our concentration in specific risk types, and to protect against taking risks that exceed the amount of overall capital AIG has available. These limits are approved by our CRO with consultation from the GRC.\n",
      "• BU level limits are set to address key risks identified by ERM for the business unit/module and/or meet business unit/module specific requirements by regulators and rating agencies. These limits are defined by the business unit risk officers.\n",
      "All limits are reviewed by the FRG, GRC or relevant business unit risk committees on a periodic basis and revisions, if applicable, are approved by those committees.\n",
      "The business units are responsible for measuring and monitoring their risk exposures. ERM is responsible for monitoring compliance with limits and providing regular, timely reporting to our senior management and risk committees. Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner and are documented and escalated in accordance with their level of severity or materiality.\n",
      "Risk Identification and Measurement\n",
      "One tool we use to inform our Risk Appetite Framework is risk identification. We conduct risk identification through a number of processes at the business unit and corporate level focused on capturing our material risks and key areas of focus for follow-up risk management actions. A key initiative is our integrated bottom-up risk identification and assessment process down to the product-line level. These processes are used as a critical input to enhance and develop our analytics for measuring and assessing risks across the organization.\n",
      "We employ various approaches to measure, monitor, and manage risk exposures, including the utilization of a variety of metrics and early warning indicators. We use a proprietary stress testing framework to measure our quantifiable risks. This framework is built on our existing ERM stress testing methodology for both insurance and non-insurance operations.\n",
      "The framework measures risk over multiple time horizons and under different levels of stress. We develop a range of stress scenarios based both on internal experience and regulatory guidance. The stress tests are intended to ensure that sufficient resources are available under both idiosyncratic and systemic market stress conditions.\n",
      "The stress testing framework assesses our aggregate exposure to our most significant financial and insurance risks, including the risk in each of our key insurance company subsidiaries in relation to its capital needs under stress, risks inherent in our non-insurance company subsidiaries, and risks to AIG consolidated capital. We use this information to determine the resources needed at the AIG Parent level to support our subsidiaries and capital resources required to maintain consolidated company target capitalization levels.\n",

      "Overview\n",
      "Credit risk is defined as the risk that our customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due. Credit risk may also result from a downgrade of a counterparty’s credit ratings or a widening of its credit spreads.\n",
      "We devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures. These exposures may arise from, but are not limited to, fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees and letters of credit.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Our credit risks are managed by a team of investment professionals, subject to ERM oversight and various control processes. ERM is assisted by credit functions headed by highly experienced credit professionals. Their primary role is to assure appropriate credit risk management in accordance with our credit policies and procedures relative to our credit risk parameters. Our Chief Credit Officer (CCO) and credit executives are primarily responsible for the development, implementation and maintenance of a risk management framework, which includes the following elements related to our credit risks:\n",
      "• developing and implementing our company-wide credit policies and procedures;\n",
      "• approving delegated credit authorities to our credit executives and qualified investment professionals;\n",
      "• developing methodologies for quantification and assessment of credit risks, including the establishment and maintenance of our internal risk rating process;\n",
      "• managing a system of credit and program limits, as well as the approval process for credit transactions, above limit exposures, and concentrations of risk that may exist or be incurred;\n",
      "• evaluating, monitoring, reviewing and reporting of credit risks and concentrations regularly with senior management; and\n",
      "• approving appropriate credit reserves, credit-related other-than-temporary impairments and corresponding methodologies for all credit portfolios.\n",
      "We monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require mitigants, such as third-party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, including commercial bank-issued letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. We treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, and letters of credit as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data. We also monitor closely the quality of any trust collateral accounts.\n",
      "See Investments - Available for Sale Investments herein for further information on our credit concentrations and credit exposures.\n",
      "Market Risk Management\n",
      "Market risk is defined as the risk of adverse impact due to systemic movements in one or more of the following market risk drivers: equity and commodity prices, residential and commercial real estate values, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange, inflation, and their levels of volatility.\n",
      "We are engaged in a variety of insurance, investment and other financial services businesses that generate market risk, directly and indirectly. We are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities, on both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet through on and off-balance sheet exposures. The chief risk officer within each business is responsible for creating a framework to properly identify these risks, then ensuring that they are appropriately measured, monitored and managed in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the Chief Market Risk Officer (CMRO).\n",
      "The scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner consistent with our risk appetite statement. Our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in these broad market observables, as opposed to from the idiosyncratic risks associated with individual assets that are addressed through our credit risk management function.\n",

      "Market risk focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in broad, external, predominantly market observable risks. Financial repercussions can include an adverse impact on results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital.\n",
      "Each of the following systemic risks is considered a market risk:\n",
      "Equity prices. We are exposed to changes in equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments. Changes in equity prices can affect the valuation of publicly-traded equity shares, investments in private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other equity-linked capital market instruments as well as equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance.\n",
      "Residential and commercial real estate values. Our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments. Changes in residential/commercial real estate prices can affect the valuation of residential/commercial mortgages, residential/commercial mortgage-backed securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential/commercial mortgages, trusts that include residential/commercial real estate and/or mortgages, residential mortgage insurance contracts and commercial real estate investments.\n",
      "Interest rates. Interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities. Lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and make certain of our product offerings less attractive to investors. Conversely, higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons. However, when rates rise quickly, there can be a temporary asymmetric GAAP accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income, and the offsetting decrease in the value of related liabilities may not be recognized. Changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, financial liabilities, insurance contracts including but not limited to fixed rate annuities, variable annuities and derivative contracts.\n",
      "Credit spreads. Credit spreads measure an instrument’s risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default-free instrument. Changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including but not limited to corporate bonds, ABS, mortgage-backed securities, AIG-issued debt obligations, credit derivatives and derivative credit valuation adjustments. Much like higher interest rates, wider credit spreads with unchanged default losses mean more investment income in the long-term. In the short term, quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income. A precipitous widening of credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the credit-worthiness of bond obligors, potentially resulting in default losses.\n",
      "Foreign exchange (FX) rates. We are a globally diversified enterprise with income, assets and liabilities denominated in, and capital deployed in, a variety of currencies. Changes in FX rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of balance sheet and income statement items as well as the settlement of cash flows exchanged in specific transactions.\n",
      "Commodity Prices. Changes in commodity prices (the value of commodities) can affect the valuation of publicly-traded commodities, commodity indices and derivatives on commodities and commodity indices. We are exposed to commodity prices primarily through their impact on the prices and credit quality of commodity producers’ debt and equity securities in our investment portfolio.\n",
      "Inflation. Changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including AIG-issued debt obligations, derivatives and other contracts explicitly linked to inflation indices, and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly, via indexing, or implicitly, through medical costs or wage levels.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Market risk is overseen at the corporate level within ERM through the CMRO, who reports directly to the AIG CRO. The CMRO is supported by a dedicated team of professionals within ERM.

      "Risk Measurement\n",
      "Our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures. At the firm-wide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with AIG’s risk appetite statement. This is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework. Our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital and liquidity levels. At the market risk level, the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change on an economic basis.\n",
      "In addition, we continue to use enhanced economic, GAAP accounting and statutory capital-based risk measures at the market risk level, business-unit level and firm-wide levels. This process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures.\n",
      "We use a number of approaches to measure our market risk exposure, including:\n",
      "Sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input. Examples of such sensitivities include a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity securities, a one basis point increase in credit spreads of fixed maturity securities, and a one percent increase in prices of equity securities.\n",
      "Scenario analysis. Scenario analysis uses historical, hypothetical, or forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures. Examples of hypothetical scenarios include a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve or a 20 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in world-wide equity markets. Scenarios may also utilize a stochastic framework to arrive at a probability distribution of losses.\n",
      "Stress testing. Stress testing is a special form of scenario analysis in which the scenarios are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome. Examples of such scenarios include the stock market crash of October 1987 or the widening of yields or spreads of RMBS or CMBS during 2008.\n",

      "Market Risk Sensitivities\n",
      "The following table provides estimates of our sensitivity to changes in yield curves, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates:\n",
      "(a) At December 31, 2016, the analysis covered $276.9 billion of $292.5 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded were $8.1 billion of loans and $2.5 billion of investments in life settlements. In addition, $5.0 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations. At December 31, 2015, the analysis covered $279.6 billion of $298.7 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded were $10.7 billion of loans and $3.6 billion of investments in life settlements. In addition, $4.8 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations.\n",
      "(b) The majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag.\n",
      "Foreign currency-denominated net asset position reflects our consolidated non-U.S. dollar assets less our consolidated non-U.S dollar liabilities on a GAAP basis, with certain adjustments. We use a bottom-up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory capital at the regulated insurance entity level. At the AIG Parent level, we monitor our single foreign currency exposures and limit the risk of the aggregate currency portfolio.\n",
      "Our foreign currency-denominated net asset position at December 31, 2016, decreased by $830 million compared to December 31, 2015. The decrease was mostly due to a $1.6 billion decrease in our Hong Kong dollar position, primarily resulting from the sale of our Property Casualty Insurance Companies’ PICC Investment, partially offset by a $600 million increase in our Japanese yen position primarily due to hedging activities, unrealized appreciation, and strengthening of the yen against the U.S. dollar.\n",
      "For illustrative purposes, we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The estimated results presented in the table above should not be taken as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events.\n",

      "• a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve is consistent with a one standard deviation movement of the benchmark ten-year treasury yield;\n",
      "• a 20 percent drop for equity and alternative investments is broadly consistent with a one standard deviation movement in the S&P 500; and\n",
      "• a 10 percent depreciation of foreign currency exchange rates is consistent with a one standard deviation movement in the U.S. dollar (USD)/Japanese yen (JPY) exchange rate.\n",
      "Risk Monitoring and Limits\n",
      "The risk monitoring responsibilities, owned by the business units, include ensuring compliance with market risk limits and escalation and remediation of limit breaches. Such activities must be reported to the ERM Market Risk team by the relevant business unit. This monitoring approach is aligned with our overall risk limits framework.\n",
      "To control our exposure to market risk, we rely on a three-tiered hierarchy of limits that the CMRO closely monitors and reports to our CRO, senior management and risk committees.\n",
      "See Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement - Risk Limits herein for further information on our three-tiered hierarchy of limits.\n",
      "Liquidity Risk Management\n",
      "Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations. Failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in insolvency, reduced operating flexibility, increased costs, reputational harm and regulatory action.\n",
      "AIG and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity during both the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash will be available to meet the obligations as they come due.\n",
      "AIG Parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are designed to allow it to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six- months under a liquidity stress scenario. We maintain liquidity limits and minimum coverage ratios designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions. If we project that we will breach these tolerances, we will assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions. However, the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements.\n",
      "Risk Identification\n",
      "The following sources of liquidity and funding risks could impact our ability to meet short-term financial obligations as they come due.\n",
      "• Market/Monetization Risk: Assets may not be readily transformed into cash due to unfavorable market conditions. Market liquidity risk may limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs.\n",
      "• Cash Flow Mismatch Risk: Discrete and cumulative cash flow mismatches or gaps over short-term horizons under both expected and adverse business conditions may create future liquidity shortfalls.\n",
      "• Event Funding Risk: Additional funding may be required as the result of a trigger event. Event funding risk comes in many forms and may result from a downgrade in credit ratings, a market event, or some other event that creates a funding obligation or limits existing funding options.\n",
      "• Financing Risk: We may be unable to raise additional cash on a secured or unsecured basis due to unfavorable market conditions, AIG-specific issues, or any other issue that impedes access to additional funding.\n",

      "• The Risk Event Capture process enables each employee to identify, document, and escalate operational risk impacts, with a view to enhancing, processes and promoting lessons learned.\n",
      "• The Vulnerability Identification (VID) process identifies emerging risks, which we consider to be risks that have not yet fully manifested themselves but could become significant over time.\n",
      "• The Ordinal Risk Ranking effort provides an ordinal ranking of AIG’s most significant operational risks at the Enterprise, Segment or Regional levels, with the goal of prioritizing assessment and remediation activity.\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K 153\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "• The Risk and Control Self-Assessments (RCSAs) allow for the identification and assessment of the key operational risks within our respective business units and a determination as to whether the related controls are effective.\n",
      "• Scenario Analyses are executed to identify the remote, but plausible, potential risks that could result in severe financial losses.\n",
      "ORM, working together with other second lines of defense functions (e.g., Model Validation and the Technology Risk office, as well as Compliance, Sarbanes Oxley, and Global Business Continuity), provides an independent view of Operational Risk for each business, and works with the business to facilitate implementation of the above programs. This includes coverage of operational risks related to core insurance activities, investing, model risk, technology (including cyber security, access, data privacy and data security), third-party providers, as well as compliance and regulatory matters. Based on the results of the risk identification and assessment efforts above, business leaders are accountable for tracking and remediating identified issues in line with our risk monitoring procedures. Governance committees support these efforts and promote transparency and management decision making.\n",
      "An integrated risk and control framework facilitates the identification and mitigation of operational risk issues. To accomplish this, our integrated risk and control framework is designed to:\n",
      "• ensure first line accountability and ownership of risks and controls;\n",
      "• promote role clarity among the business and risk and control functions;\n",
      "• enhance transparency, risk management governance and culture;\n",
      "• foster greater consistency in identifying and ranking material risks;\n",
      "• pro-actively address potential risk issues and assign clear ownership and accountability for addressing identified risk issues; and\n",
      "• accelerate the development of technology solutions that support the objectives above.\n",
      "Insurance Risks\n",
      "Except as described above, we manage our business risk oversight activities through our insurance operations. A primary goal in managing our insurance operations is to achieve an acceptable risk-adjusted return on equity. To achieve this goal, we must be disciplined in risk selection, premium adequacy, and appropriate terms and conditions to cover the risk accepted.\n",
      "We operate our insurance businesses on a global basis, and we are exposed to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. We manage these risks throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of procedures:\n",
      "• pre-launch approval of product design, development and distribution;\n",
      "• underwriting approval processes and authorities;\n",
      "• exposure limits with ongoing monitoring;\n",
      "• management of relationship between assets and liabilities, including hedging;\n",
      "• enhanced pricing models;\n",
      "• modeling and reporting of aggregations and limit concentrations at multiple levels (policy, line of business, product group, country, individual/group, correlation and catastrophic risk events);\n",
      "• compliance with financial reporting and capital and solvency targets;\n",
      "• use of reinsurance, both internal and third-party; and\n",
      "• review and challenge of reserves to ensure comprehensive analysis with established escalation procedures to provide appropriate transparency in reserving decisions and judgments made in the establishment of reserves.\n",
      "We closely manage insurance risk by monitoring and controlling the nature and geographic location of the risks in each line of business underwritten, the terms and conditions of the underwriting and the premiums we charge for taking on the risk. We analyze concentrations of risk using various modeling techniques, including both probability distributions (stochastic) and/or single-point estimates (deterministic) approaches.\n",
      "Risk Identification\n",
      "• Property Casualty Insurance Companies - risks covered include property, casualty, fidelity/surety, accident and health, aviation, and management liability. We manage risks in the general insurance business through aggregations and limitations of concentrations at multiple levels: policy, line of business, geography, industry and legal entity.\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K 154\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "• Life Insurance Companies - risks include mortality and morbidity in the insurance-oriented products and insufficient cash flows to cover contract liabilities and longevity risk in the retirement savings-oriented products. We manage risks through product design, sound medical and non-medical underwriting, and external reinsurance programs.\n",
      "We purchase reinsurance for our insurance operations. Reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. We may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis. Pooling of our reinsurance risks enables us to purchase reinsurance more efficiently at a consolidated level, manage global counterparty risk and relationships and manage global catastrophe risks.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Insurance risks are monitored at the business unit level within ERM and overseen by the business unit chief risk officer, who reports directly to our CRO. The framework includes the following key components:\n",
      "• written policies that define the rules for our insurance risk-taking activities;\n",
      "• a limit framework focused on key insurance risks that aligns with our Board-approved risk appetite statement; and\n",
      "• clearly defined authorities for all individuals and committee roles and responsibilities related to insurance risk management.\n",
      "Risk Measurement, Monitoring and Limits\n",
      "We use a number of approaches to measure our insurance risk exposure, including:\n",
      "Stochastic methods. Stochastic methods are used to measure and monitor risks including natural catastrophe, reserve and premium risk. We develop probabilistic estimates of risk based on our exposures, historical observed volatility or industry-recognized models in the case of catastrophe risk.\n",
      "Scenario analysis. Scenario or deterministic analysis is used to measure and monitor risks such as terrorism or to estimate losses due to man-made catastrophic scenarios.\n",
      "In addition, we monitor concentrations of exposure through insurance limits aggregated along dimensions such as geography, industry, or counterparty.\n",
      "The risk monitoring responsibilities of the business units include ensuring compliance with insurance risk limits and escalation and remediation of limit breaches. Such activities are reported to management by the relevant business unit for informative decision-making on a regular basis. This monitoring approach is aligned with our overall risk limits framework.\n",
      "Risk limits have a consistent framework used across AIG, its business units, and legal entities. This includes escalation thresholds in cases where measurement is particularly challenging.\n",
      "See Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement - Risk Limits herein for further information on our three-tiered hierarchy of limits\n",
      "Property Casualty Insurance Companies Key Insurance Risks\n",
      "We manage insurance risks through risk review and selection processes, exposure limitations, exclusions, deductibles, self-insured retentions, coverage limits, attachment points, and reinsurance. This management is supported by sound underwriting practices, pricing procedures and the use of actuarial analysis to help determine overall adequacy of provisions for insurance. Underwriting practices and pricing procedures incorporate historical experience, changes in underlying exposure, current regulation and judicial decisions as well as proposed or anticipated regulatory changes.\n",
      "For Property Casualty Insurance Companies, insurance risks primarily include the following:\n",
      "• Loss Reserves - The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the Property Casualty Insurance Companies. There is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. We manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. See Item 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates - Insurance Liabilities - Loss Reserves herein for further information.\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K 155\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "• Underwriting - The potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the Property Casualty Insurance Companies’ ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. This may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, worse than expected prepayment of policies, investment results, or unexpected or increased costs or expenses.\n",
      "• Catastrophe Exposure - Our business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect our operating results. Other risks, such as man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n",
      "• Single Risk Loss Exposure - Our business is exposed to loss events that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. Events such as fires or explosions can result in loss activity for our clients. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by our GRC through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance. Furthermore, single risk loss exposure is managed and monitored on both a segregated and aggregated basis.\n",
      "• Reinsurance - Since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers either due to an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event, or that actual reinsurance coverage is different than anticipated. The inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n",
      "Natural Catastrophe Risk\n",
      "We manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate Probable Maximum Loss (PML) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.\n",
      "We use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. We apply a proprietary multi-model approach to account for relative strengths and weaknesses of vendor models, and make adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.\n",
      "We perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model weaknesses, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. Lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts that allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.\n",
      "We recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policy to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. For example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. In addition, we are committed to providing innovative insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change, including expanding natural disaster resilience, promoting adaptation, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Our internal product development, underwriting, modeling, and sustainability practices will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.\n",
      "Our natural catastrophe exposure is primarily driven by the U.S. and Japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries. For example, we have exposures to additional perils such as European windstorms and floods and seismic events across the Pacific Rim. Within the U.S., we have significant hurricane exposure in Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, Northeast U.S. and mid-Atlantic regions. Events impacting the Northeast U.S. and the mid-Atlantic may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in those regions. Within the U.S., we have significant earthquake exposure in California, the Pacific Northwest and New Madrid regions. Earthquakes impacting the Pacific Northwest and New Madrid regions may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in these regions.\n",
      "The estimates below are the Occurrence Exceedance Probability (OEP) losses, which reflect losses that may occur in any single event due to the defined peril. The 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 PMLs are the probable maximum losses from a single natural catastrophe event with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent in a year, respectively.\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K 156\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "The following table presents an overview of OEP modeled losses for top perils and countries:\n",
      "(a) The U.S. hurricane amount includes losses to Property from hurricane hazards of wind and storm surge.\n",
      "(b) U.S. earthquake loss estimates represent exposure to Property, Workers’ Compensation (U.S.) and A&H business lines.\n",
      "(c) Japan Earthquake represents exposure to Property and A&H business lines.\n",
      "The OEP estimates provided above reflect our in-force portfolios at September 30, 2016, for both U.S. and Japan exposures. The catastrophe reinsurance program is as of January 1, 2017.\n",
      "AIG, along with other property casualty insurance and reinsurance companies, uses industry-recognized catastrophe models and applies proprietary modeling processes and assumptions to arrive at loss estimates. The use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially change the projected losses. Since there is no industry standard for assumptions and preparation of insured data for use in these models, our modeled losses may not be comparable to estimates made by other companies.\n",
      "Also, the modeled results are based on the assumption that all reinsurers fulfill their obligations to us under the terms of the reinsurance arrangements and all catastrophe bonds attach and pay as modeled. However, reinsurance recoverable may not be fully collectible. In particular, the use of catastrophe bonds may not provide commensurate levels of protection compared to traditional reinsurance transactions. Therefore, these estimates are inherently uncertain and may not accurately reflect our exposure to these events.\n",
      "Our 2017 catastrophe reinsurance program includes coverage for natural catastrophes and some coverage for terrorism events. It consists of a large North American occurrence cover (without reinstatement) to protect against large North America losses, and Japan covers to protect against losses in Japan. The attachment point for this reinsurance program is at $1.5 billion for the North American cover ($3 billion in 2016) and varies for the Japan covers. The North American cover has reduced the U.S. Hurricane (1-in-100) OEP net of reinsurance from $3.1 billion under the 2016 reinsurance program to $2.0 billion under the 2017 program.\n",
      "Actual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios. The occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors - Reserves and Exposures for additional information.\n",
      "Terrorism Risk\n",
      "We actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. We have set risk limits based on modeled losses from certain terrorism attack scenarios. Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model and various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the Property Casualty Insurance Companies exposures. Examples of modeled scenarios are conventional bombs of different sizes, anthrax attacks and nuclear attacks.\n",
      "Our largest terrorism exposures are in New York City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers’ Compensation lines of business. At our largest exposure location, modeled losses for a five-ton bomb attack net of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (TRIPRA) and reinsurance recoveries are estimated to be $2.8 billion as of September 30, 2016.\n",
      "Our exposure to terrorism risk in the U.S. is mitigated by TRIPRA in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIPRA covers terrorist attacks within the United States or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law. In 2017, TRIPRA covers 83 percent of insured losses above a deductible, decreasing by one percent each year to 80 percent in 2020. The current estimate of our deductible is approximately $2.5 billion for 2016.\n",
      "We offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. We also rely on the government sponsored and government arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K 157\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "Reinsurance Activities\n",
      "Reinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss exposure related to certain events such as natural and man-made catastrophes. Our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.\n",
      "Reinsurance markets include:\n",
      "• Traditional local and global reinsurance markets including those in the United States, Bermuda, London and Europe, accessed directly and through reinsurance intermediaries;\n",
      "• Capital markets through insurance-linked securities and collateralized reinsurance transactions, such as catastrophe bonds, sidecars and similar vehicles; and\n",
      "• Other insurers that engage in both direct and assumed reinsurance.\n",
      "The form of reinsurance we may choose from time to time will generally depend on whether we are seeking:\n",
      "• proportional reinsurance, whereby we cede a specified percentage of premiums and losses to reinsurers;\n",
      "• non-proportional or excess of loss reinsurance, whereby we cede all or a specified portion of losses in excess of a specified amount on a per risk, per occurrence (including catastrophe reinsurance) or aggregate basis; or\n",
      "• facultative contracts that reinsure individual policies.\n",
      "We continually evaluate the relative attractiveness of different forms of reinsurance contracts and different markets that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives.\n",
      "Reinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. However, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.\n",
      "In certain markets, we are required to participate on a proportional basis in reinsurance pools based on our relative share of direct writings in those markets. Such mandatory reinsurance generally covers higher-risk consumer exposures such as assigned-risk automobile and earthquake, as well as certain commercial exposures such as workers’ compensation.\n",
      "Reinsurance Recoverable\n",
      "AIG’s reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of:\n",
      "• Paid losses recoverable - balances due from reinsurers for losses and loss adjustment expenses paid by our subsidiaries and billed, but not yet collected.\n",
      "• Ceded loss reserves - ultimate ceded reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, including reserves for claims reported but not yet paid and estimates for IBNR.\n",
      "• Ceded reserves for unearned premiums.\n",
      "At December 31, 2016, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $21.9 billion. These assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $1.1 billion, ceded loss reserves of $15.7 billion including reserves for IBNR, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $3.4 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverables of $1.7 billion. The methods used to estimate IBNR and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. These methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments are reflected in income. We believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at December 31, 2016 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. Actual losses may, however, differ, perhaps materially, from the reserves currently ceded.\n",
      "The Reinsurance Credit Department (RCD) conducts periodic detailed assessments of the financial strength and condition of current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic. The RCD monitors the financial condition of reinsurers as well as the total reinsurance recoverable ceded to reinsurers, and sets limits with regard to the amount and type of exposure we are willing to cede to reinsurers. As part of these assessments, the RCD assesses the financial capacity and liquidity of reinsurers; and evaluates the local economic and financial environment in which foreign reinsurers operate. The RCD reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for measures, including collateral to mitigate credit risk. For example, in our treaty reinsurance contracts, we frequently include provisions that allow us to require a reinsurer to post collateral or use other measures to reduce exposure when a referenced event occurs. Furthermore, we limit our unsecured exposure to reinsurers through the use of credit triggers such as insurer financial strength rating downgrades, declines in regulatory capital, or specified declines in risk-based capital (RBC) ratios. We also set maximum limits for reinsurance recoverable exposure, which in some cases is the recoverable amount plus an estimate of the\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K 158\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "maximum potential exposure from unexpected loss events that could be ceded to a reinsurer. In addition, credit executives within ERM review reinsurer exposures and credit limits and approve reinsurer credit limits above specified levels. Finally, even where we conclude that uncollateralized credit risk is acceptable, we require collateral from active reinsurance counterparties where it is necessary for our subsidiaries to recognize the reinsurance recoverable assets for statutory accounting purposes. At December 31, 2016, we held $8.1 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or evergreen letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers. We believe that no exposure to a single reinsurer represents an inappropriate concentration of risk to us.\n",
      "The following table presents information for each reinsurer representing in excess of five percent of our total reinsurance recoverable assets:\n",
      "(a) The financial strength ratings reflect the ratings of the various reinsurance subsidiaries of the companies listed as of January 3, 2017.\n",
      "(b) Total reinsurance assets include both the Property Casualty Insurance Companies and the Life Insurance Companies reinsurance recoverable.\n",
      "(c) Excludes collateral held in excess of applicable balances.\n",
      "(d) Includes $1.8 billion recoverable under the 2011 retroactive reinsurance transaction pursuant to which a large portion of the Property Casualty Insurance Companies net domestic asbestos liabilities were transferred to NICO. Does not include reinsurance assets ceded to other reinsurers for which NICO has assumed the collection risk. We entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO, discussed in Item 7. MD&A - Insurance Reserves - Reinsurance Activities. Based on reserves as of December 31, 2016, this agreement will increase the gross reinsurance assets and collateral held from the Berkshire Hathaway Group of Companies by approximately $12.8 billion and $10.2 billion, respectively.\n",
      "At December 31, 2016, we had no significant general reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. Reinsurer capital levels remained stable in 2016, and the industry’s robust underwriting capacity resulted in continued competition and attractive rates for 2017 renewals. Reduced profitability associated with lower rates could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. The RCD, in conjunction with the credit executives within ERM, reviews these developments, monitors credit triggers that may require the reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.\n",

      "Life Insurance Companies Key Insurance Risks\n",
      "Our Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance and Institutional Markets businesses manage risk through product design, experience monitoring, pricing actions, risk limitations, reinsurance and active monitoring and management of the relationships between assets and liabilities, including hedging.\n",
      "For our Individual and Group Retirement and Life Insurance products offered by the Life Insurance Companies, key insurance risks include the following:\n",
      "• Mortality risk - represents the risk of loss arising from actual mortality rates being higher than expected mortality rates. This risk could arise from pandemics or other events, including longer-term societal changes that cause higher than expected mortality. This risk exists in a number of our product lines, but is most significant for our life insurance products.\n",
      "• Longevity risk - represents the risk of a change in value of a policy or benefit as a result of actual mortality rates being lower than the expected mortality rates. This risk could arise from longer-term societal health changes as well as other factors. This risk exists in a number of our product lines but is most significant for our retirement, institutional and annuity products.\n",
      "• Policyholder behavior risk including surrender/lapse risk - represents the risk that actual policyholder behavior differs from expected behavior in a manner that has an adverse effect on our results of operations. There are many assumptions made when products are sold, including how long the contracts will persist. Actual experience can vary significantly from these assumptions. This risk is impacted by a number of factors including changes in market conditions, especially interest rate and equity market changes, tax law, regulations and policyholder preferences. This risk exists in the majority of our product lines.\n",
      "• Interest rate risk - represents the potential for loss due to a change in interest rates. Interest rate risk is measured with respect to assets, liabilities (both insurance-related and financial) and derivatives. This risk manifests itself when interest rates move significantly in a short period of time. Rapidly rising interest rates create the potential for increased surrenders. Interest rate risk\n",
      "AIG | 2016 Form 10-K 159\n",
      "ITEM 7 | Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "can also manifest itself over a longer period of time, such as in a persistent low interest rate environment. Low long-term interest rates put pressure on investment returns, which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce, or eliminate future profits on certain existing fixed rate products.\n",
      "• Equity risk - represents the potential for loss due to changes in equity prices. It affects equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities (and associated guaranteed living and death benefits, as discussed below), universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance. In addition, changes in the volatility of equity prices can affect the valuation of insurance features that are accounted for as embedded derivatives and the related economic hedges.\n",
      "The emergence of significant adverse experience compared to the initial assumptions at policy issuance or updated assumption would require an adjustment to DAC and benefit reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for a particular period. For additional discussion of the impact of actual and expected experience on DAC and benefit reserves, see Critical Accounting Estimates - Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health (Life Insurance Companies) and Critical Accounting Estimates - Guaranteed Benefit Features of Variable Annuity Products (Life Insurance Companies). For additional discussion of business risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Business and Operations.\n",
      "Variable Annuity Risk Management and Hedging Programs\n",
      "Our Individual and Group Retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with GMWB riders that guarantee a certain level of benefits. GMWB guaranteed living benefits are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses). GMWB features subject the Life Insurance Companies to market risk, including exposure to changes in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility.\n",
      "Variable annuity product design is the first step in managing our exposure to these market risks. Risk mitigation features of our variable annuity product design include GMWB rider fees indexed to an equity market volatility index, which can provide additional fee assessments in periods of increased market volatility, required minimum allocations to fixed accounts to reduce overall equity exposure, and the utilization of volatility control funds, which reduce equity exposure in the funds in response to changes in market volatility, even under sudden or extreme market movements.\n",
      "After reflecting our product risk-mitigating features, we hedge our remaining economic exposure to market risk within GMWB features through our variable annuity hedging program, which is designed to offset certain changes in the economic value of these GMWB embedded derivatives, within established thresholds. The hedging program is designed to provide additional protection against large and combined movements in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility under multiple scenarios.\n",
      "Our hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents our estimate of the underlying economic risks in our GMWB riders, based on the present value of the future expected benefit payments for the GMWB, less the present value of future rider fees, over numerous stochastic scenarios. This stochastic projection method uses best estimate assumptions for policyholder behavior (including mortality, lapses, withdrawals and benefit utilization) in conjunction with market scenarios calibrated to observable equity and interest rate option prices. Policyholder behaviors are regularly evaluated to compare current assumptions to actual experience and, if appropriate, changes are made to the policyholder behavior assumptions. The risk of changes in policyholder behavior is not explicitly hedged and such differences between expected and actual policyholder behaviors may result in hedge ineffectiveness.\n",
      "Due to differences between the calculation of the economic hedge target and U.S. GAAP valuation of the embedded derivative, which include differences in the treatment of rider fees and exclusion of certain risk margins and other differences in discount rates, we expect relative movements in the economic hedge target and the U.S. GAAP embedded derivative valuation will vary over time with changes in equity markets, interest rates and credit spreads. See Insurance Reserves - Life and Annuity Reserves and DAC - Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefits and Hedging Results for information on the impact on our consolidated pre-tax income from the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives and the hedging portfolio, as well as additional discussion of differences between the economic hedge target and the valuation of the embedded derivatives.\n",
      "In designing our hedging portfolio for our variable annuity hedging program, we make assumptions and projections about the future performance of the underlying contract holder funds. To project future account value changes, we make assumptions about how each of the underlying funds will perform. We map the contract holder funds to a set of publicly traded indices that we believe best represent the liability to be hedged. Basis risk exists due to the variance between these assumptions and actual fund returns, which may result in variances between changes in the hedging portfolio and changes in the economic hedge target. Net hedge results and the cost of hedging are also impacted by differences between realized volatility and implied volatility.\n",
      "For index annuity and universal life products, we have a hedging program designed to manage the index crediting strategies associated with index annuity and index life products. This hedging program is designed to offset the economic risk with respect to the index returns for the current crediting rate reset period, and utilizes derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity index\n",

      "To manage the capital market exposures embedded within the economic hedge target, we identify and hedge market sensitivities to changes in equity markets, interest rates, volatility and for variable annuities, credit spreads. Each hedge program purchases derivative instruments or securities having sensitivities that offset those in the economic hedge target, within internally defined threshold levels. Since the relative movements of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target vary over time or with market changes, the net exposure can be outside the threshold limits, and adjustments to the hedging portfolio are made periodically to return the net exposure to within threshold limits.\n",
      "Our hedging programs utilize various derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts, interest rate swaps and swaption contracts, as well as other hedging instruments. In addition, for variable annuities, we purchase certain fixed income securities and elect the fair value option as a capital efficient way to manage interest rate and credit spread exposures. To minimize counterparty credit risk, the majority of our derivative instrument hedges are implemented using exchange-traded futures and options, cleared through global exchanges. Over the counter derivatives are highly collateralized.\n",
      "The hedging programs are monitored on a daily basis to ensure that the economic hedge target and derivative portfolio are within the threshold limits, pursuant to the approved hedge strategy. Daily risk monitoring verifies that the net risk exposures, as measured through sensitivities to a large set of market shocks, are within the approved net risk exposure threshold limits. In addition, monthly stress tests are performed to determine the program’s effectiveness relative to the applicable limits, under an array of combined severe market stresses in equity prices, interest rates, volatility and credit spreads. Finally, hedge strategies are reviewed regularly to gauge their effectiveness in managing our market exposures in the context of our overall risk appetite.\n",

      "Derivative Transactions\n",
      "We utilize derivatives principally to enable us to hedge exposure to interest rates, currencies, credit, commodities, equities and other risks. Credit risk associated with derivative counterparties exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to us. The maximum potential exposure will increase or decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions. All derivative transactions must be transacted within counterparty limits that have been approved by ERM.\n",
      "We evaluate counterparty credit quality by internal analysis consistent with the AIG Credit Policy. We utilize various credit enhancements, including letters of credit, guarantees, collateral, credit triggers, credit derivatives, margin agreements and subordination to reduce the credit risk relating to outstanding financial derivative transactions. We require credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties, and transaction size and maturity. Furthermore, we enter into certain agreements that have the benefit of set-off and close-out netting provisions, such as ISDA Master Agreements. These provisions provide that, in the case of an early termination of a transaction, we can set off receivables from a counterparty against payables to the same counterparty arising out of all covered transactions. As a result, where a legally enforceable netting agreement exists, the fair value of the transaction with the counterparty represents the net sum of estimated fair values.\n",
      "The fair value of our interest rate, currency, credit, commodity and equity swaps, options, swaptions, and forward commitments, futures, and forward contracts reported as a component of Other Assets, was approximately $1.8 billion at December 31, 2016 and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2015.

Specific responsibilities include setting risk tolerances, reviewing capital management strategies (including asset allocation and risk financing), insurance portfolio optimization, risk management policies and providing oversight of risk-adjusted metrics. In addition, each business unit has established subordinate committees which identify, assess and monitor the specific operational, transactional and financial risks inherent in its respective business. Together, the committees described above provide comprehensive risk oversight throughout the organization.\n",

      "Our Risk Appetite Framework integrates stakeholder interests, strategic business goals and available financial resources. We balance these by seeking to take measured risks that are expected to generate repeatable, sustainable earnings and create long-term value for our shareholders. The framework includes our Risk Appetite Statement approved by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof and a set of supporting tools, including risk tolerances, risk limits and policies, which we use to manage our risk profile and financial resources.\n",
      "We articulate our aggregate risk-taking by setting risk tolerances on capital and liquidity measures. These measures are set at the AIG Parent as well as the legal entity level and cover consolidated and insurance company capital and liquidity ratios. We must comply with standards for capital adequacy and maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all our obligations as they come due in accordance with our internal capital management and liquidity policies. Our risk tolerances take into consideration regulatory requirements, rating agency expectations, and business needs. The GRC routinely reviews the level of risk taken by the consolidated organization in relation to the established risk tolerances. A consolidated risk report is also presented periodically, as required, to the RCC by our CRO.\n",
      "Risk Limits\n",
      "A key component of our Risk Appetite Framework is having a process in place that establishes and maintains appropriate limits on the material risks identified for our core businesses and facilitates monitoring and meeting of both internal and external stakeholder expectations. Our objectives include:\n",
      "• Monitoring of risks, providing early warning indicators, and ensuring timely oversight and enforceability;\n",
      "• Defining a consistent and transparent approach to limits governance from the group-level to regional entities; and\n",
      "• Alignment with Risk Appetite Statement, where applicable.\n",
      "To support the monitoring and management of AIG’s and its business units’ material risks, ERM has an established limits framework that employs a three-tiered hierarchy:\n",
      "• Level I Limits are AIG consolidated level limits. They define our aggregate maximum exposures for core risks within the boundaries set by the Risk Appetite Statement, and constrain our concentration in specific risk types. These limits are set to manage key risks identified by ERM and to meet requirements by regulators and rating agencies at a consolidated level. Level 1 Limits are reported to the FRG, GRC and RCC.\n",
      "• Level II Limits are business unit level limits. They define our appetite for specific, material risk taking activities within business units and corporate functions. These key risks are identified by ERM for the business unit and/or corporate function, and risk limits are developed to meet the specific requirements of regulators and rating agencies. Level II Limits are reported to the business unit RCCs, where applicable.\n",
      "• Level III Limits monitor risk utilization on the regional or local level and are developed to address any specific requirements by regulators and rating agencies for that region not captured by the Level I and Level II limits. Level III Limits are reported at the local entity risk committee.\n",
      "All limits are reviewed by the FRG, GRC or relevant business unit RCCs on a periodic basis and revisions, if applicable, are approved by those committees.\n",
      "The business units are responsible for measuring and monitoring their risk exposures. ERM is responsible for monitoring compliance with limits and providing regular, timely reporting to our senior management and risk committees. Limit breaches\n",

      "are required to be reported in a timely manner and are documented and escalated in accordance with their level of severity or materiality.\n",
      "Risk Identification and Measurement\n",
      "One tool we use to inform our Risk Appetite Framework is risk identification. We conduct risk identification through a number of processes at the business unit and corporate level focused on capturing our material risks and key areas of focus for follow-up risk management actions. A key initiative is our integrated bottom-up risk identification and assessment process down to the product-line level. These processes are used as a critical input to enhance and develop our analytics for measuring and assessing risks across the organization.\n",
      "We employ various approaches to measure, monitor, and manage risk exposures, including the utilization of a variety of metrics and early warning indicators. We use a proprietary stress testing framework to measure our quantifiable risks. This framework is built on our existing ERM stress testing methodology for both insurance and non-insurance operations.\n",
      "The framework measures risk over multiple time horizons and under different levels of stress. We develop a range of stress scenarios based both on internal experience and regulatory guidance. The stress tests are intended to ensure that sufficient resources are available under both idiosyncratic and systemic market stress conditions.\n",
      "The stress testing framework assesses our aggregate exposure to our most significant financial and insurance risks, including the risk in each of our key insurance company subsidiaries in relation to its capital needs under stress, risks inherent in our non-insurance company subsidiaries, and risks to AIG consolidated capital. We use this information to determine the resources needed at the AIG Parent level to support our subsidiaries and capital resources required to maintain consolidated company target capitalization levels.\n",

      "Credit risk is defined as the risk that our customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due. Credit risk may also result from a downgrade of a counterparty’s credit ratings or a widening of its credit spreads.\n",
      "We devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures. These exposures may arise from, but are not limited to, fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees and letters of credit.\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Our credit risks are managed by a team of investment professionals, subject to ERM oversight and various control processes. ERM is assisted by credit functions headed by highly experienced credit professionals. Their primary role is to assure appropriate credit risk management in accordance with our credit policies and procedures relative to our credit risk parameters. Our Chief Credit Officer (CCO) and credit executives are primarily responsible for the development, implementation and maintenance of a risk management framework, which includes the following elements related to our credit risks:\n",
      "• developing and implementing our company-wide credit policies and procedures;\n",
      "• approving delegated credit authorities to our credit executives and qualified investment professionals;\n",
      "• developing methodologies for quantification and assessment of credit risks, including the establishment and maintenance of our internal risk rating process;\n",
      "• managing a system of credit and program limits, as well as the approval process for credit transactions, above limit exposures, and concentrations of risk that may exist or be incurred;\n",
      "• evaluating, monitoring, reviewing and reporting of credit risks and concentrations regularly with senior management; and\n",
      "• approving appropriate credit reserves, credit-related other-than-temporary impairments and corresponding methodologies for all credit portfolios.\n",
      "We monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require mitigants, such as third-party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, including commercial bank-issued letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. We treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, and letters of credit as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data. We also monitor closely the quality of any trust collateral accounts.\n",
      "See Investments - Available for Sale Investments herein for further information on our credit concentrations and credit exposures.\n",
      "Market Risk Management\n",
      "Market risk is defined as the risk of adverse impact due to systemic movements in one or more of the following market risk drivers: equity and commodity prices, residential and commercial real estate values, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange, inflation, and their levels of volatility.\n",
      "We are engaged in a variety of insurance, investment and other financial services businesses that generate market risk, directly and indirectly. We are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities, on both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet through on and off-balance sheet exposures. The chief risk officer within each business is responsible for creating a framework to properly identify these risks, then ensuring that they are appropriately measured, monitored and managed in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the Chief Market Risk Officer (CMRO).\n",
      "The scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains documented risk-taking authorities, defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner consistent with our Risk Appetite Statement. Our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in these broad market observables, as opposed to from the idiosyncratic risks associated with individual assets that are addressed through our credit risk management function.\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "Risk Identification\n",
      "Market risk focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in broad, external, predominantly market observable risks. Financial repercussions can include an adverse impact on results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital.\n",
      "Each of the following systemic risks is considered a market risk:\n",
      "Equity prices. We are exposed to changes in equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments. Changes in equity prices can affect the valuation of publicly-traded equity shares, investments in private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other equity-linked capital market instruments as well as equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance.\n",
      "Residential and commercial real estate values. Our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments. Changes in residential/commercial real estate prices can affect the valuation of residential/commercial mortgages, residential/commercial mortgage-backed securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential/commercial mortgages: trusts that include residential/commercial real estate and/or mortgages, residential mortgage insurance contracts and commercial real estate investments.\n",
      "Interest rates. Interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities. Lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and make certain of our product offerings less attractive to investors. Conversely, higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons. However, when rates rise quickly, there can be a temporary asymmetric U.S. GAAP accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income, and the offsetting decrease in the value of related liabilities may not be recognized. Changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, financial liabilities, insurance contracts including but not limited to fixed rate annuities, variable annuities and derivative contracts.\n",
      "Credit spreads. Credit spreads measure an instrument’s risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default-free instrument. Changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including but not limited to corporate bonds, ABS, mortgage-backed securities, AIG-issued debt obligations, credit derivatives and derivative credit valuation adjustments. Much like higher interest rates, wider credit spreads with unchanged default losses mean more investment income in the long-term. In the short term, quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income. A precipitous rise in credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the credit-worthiness of bond obligors, potentially resulting in default losses.\n",
      "Foreign exchange (FX) rates. We are a globally diversified enterprise with significant income, assets and liabilities denominated in, and significant capital deployed in, a variety of currencies. Changes in FX rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of balance sheet and income statement items as well as the settlement of cash flows exchanged in specific transactions.\n",
      "Commodity Prices. Changes in commodity prices (the value of commodities) can affect the valuation of publicly-traded commodities, commodity indices and derivatives on commodities and commodity indices. We are exposed to commodity prices primarily through their impact on the prices and credit quality of commodity producers’ debt and equity securities in our investment portfolio.\n",
      "Inflation. Changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including AIG-issued debt obligations, derivatives and other contracts explicitly linked to inflation indices, and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly, via indexing, or implicitly, through medical costs or wage levels.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Market risk is overseen at the corporate level within ERM through the CMRO, who reports directly to the AIG CRO. The CMRO is supported by a dedicated team of professionals within ERM. Market Risk is managed by our finance, treasury and\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "investment management corporate functions, collectively, and in partnership with ERM. The CMRO is primarily responsible for the development and maintenance of a risk management framework that includes the following key components:\n",
      "• written policies that define the rules for our market risk-taking activities and provide clear guidance regarding their execution and management;\n",
      "• a limit framework that aligns with our Board-approved Risk Appetite Statement;\n",
      "• independent measurement, monitoring and reporting for line of business, business unit and enterprise-wide market risks; and\n",
      "• clearly defined authorities for all individuals and committee roles and responsibilities related to market risk management.\n",
      "These components facilitate the CMRO’s identification, measurement, monitoring, reporting and management of our market risks.\n",
      "Risk Measurement\n",
      "Our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures. At the firm-wide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with AIG’s Risk Appetite Statement. This is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework. Our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital and liquidity levels. At the market risk level, the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change on an economic basis.\n",
      "In addition, we continue to use enhanced economic, U.S. GAAP accounting and statutory capital-based risk measures at the market risk level, business-unit level and firm-wide levels. This process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures.\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "Market Risk Sensitivities\n",
      "The following table provides estimates of our sensitivity to changes in yield curves, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates:\n",
      "(a) At December 31, 2015, the analysis covered $279.6 billion of $298.7 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded were $10.7 billion of loans and $3.6 billion of investments in life settlements. In addition, $4.8 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations. At December 31, 2014, the analysis covered $290.4 billion of $308.9 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded were $8.4 billion of loans and $3.8 billion of investments in life settlements. In addition, $6.3 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations.\n",
      "(b) Includes our investments in PICC Group and PICC P&C.\n",
      "(c) In September 2015, we sold the remainder of our ordinary shares of AerCap. Our 2014 sensitivity calculation for AerCap was based on our carrying value rather than the stock price as of the applicable date, as we applied the equity method of accounting prior to the sale.\n",
      "(d) The majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag.\n",
      "Foreign currency-denominated net asset position reflects our consolidated non-U.S. dollar assets less our consolidated non-U.S dollar liabilities on a U.S. GAAP basis. We use a bottom-up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory capital at the regulated insurance entity level. We manage cash flow risk on our foreign currency-denominated debt issued by AIG Parent and use a variety of techniques to mitigate this risk, including but not limited to the execution of cross-currency swaps and the issuance of new foreign currency-denominated debt to replace equivalent maturing debt. At the AIG Parent level, we monitor our foreign currency exposures against single currency and\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "aggregate currency portfolio limits. As a matter of general practice, we do not typically hedge our foreign currency exposures to net investments in subsidiaries.\n",
      "At December 31, 2015, our foreign currency-denominated net asset position decreased by $1.3 billion, or 11.2 percent, compared to December 31, 2014. The decrease was mostly due to a $1.7 billion decrease in our British pound position, primarily resulting from the unwinding of a cross-currency swap and a $737 million decrease in our Hong Kong dollar position, primarily resulting from the sale of ordinary shares in PICC P&C. These decreases were partially offset by a $1.3 billion increase in our euro position, primarily resulting from debt repurchases and hedging.\n",
      "For illustrative purposes, we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The estimated results presented in the table above should not be taken as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events.\n",
      "The sensitivity factors utilized for 2015 and presented above were selected based on historical data from 1995 to 2015, as follows (see the table below):\n",
      "• a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve is consistent with a one standard deviation movement of the benchmark ten-year treasury yield;\n",
      "• a 20 percent drop for equity and alternative investments is broadly consistent with a one standard deviation movement in the S&P 500; and\n",
      "• a 10 percent depreciation of foreign currency exchange rates is consistent with a one standard deviation movement in the U.S. dollar (USD)/Great Britain pound (GBP) exchange rate.\n",
      "Risk Monitoring and Limits\n",
      "The risk monitoring responsibilities, owned by the business units, include ensuring compliance with market risk limits and escalation and remediation of limit breaches. Such activities must be reported to the ERM Market Risk team by the relevant business unit. This monitoring approach is aligned with our overall risk limits framework.\n",
      "To control our exposure to market risk, we rely on a three-tiered hierarchy of limits that the CMRO closely monitors and reports to our CRO, senior management and risk committees.\n",
      "See Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement - Risk Limits herein for further information on our three-tiered hierarchy of limits.\n",
      "Liquidity Risk Management\n",
      "Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations. Failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in insolvency, reduced operating flexibility, increased costs, reputational harm and regulatory action.\n",
      "AIG and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity during both the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash can be generated to meet the obligations as they come due.\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "AIG Parent liquidity risk tolerance levels allow it to meet its obligations over a twelve month horizon consistent with its risk appetite. We maintain a target range for required liquidity and minimum coverage ratios designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions. If we project that we will breach these tolerances, we will assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions. However, the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements.\n",
      "Risk Identification\n",
      "The following sources of liquidity and funding risks could impact our ability to meet short-term financial obligations as they come due.\n",
      "• Market/Monetization Risk: Assets cannot be readily transformed into cash due to unfavorable market conditions. Market liquidity risk may limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs.\n",
      "• Cash Flow Mismatch Risk: Discrete and cumulative cash flow mismatches or gaps over short-term horizons under both expected and adverse business conditions may create future liquidity shortfalls.\n",
      "• Event Funding Risk: Additional funding is required as the result of a trigger event. Event funding risk comes in many forms and may result from a downgrade in credit ratings, a market event, or some other event that creates a funding obligation or limits existing funding options.\n",
      "• Financing Risk: We are unable to raise additional cash on a secured or unsecured basis due to unfavorable market conditions, AIG-specific issues, or any other issue that impedes access to additional funding.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Liquidity risk is overseen at the corporate level within ERM through the CMRO, who reports directly to the AIG CRO. The AIG CRO has responsibility for the oversight of the Liquidity Risk Management Framework and delegates the day-to-day implementation of this framework to the AIG Treasurer. Our corporate treasury function manages liquidity risk, subject to ERM oversight and various control processes.\n",
      "The Liquidity Risk Management Framework is guided by the liquidity risk tolerance as set forth in the Board-approved Risk Appetite Statement. The principal objective of this framework is to establish minimum liquidity requirements that protect our long-term viability and ability to fund our ongoing business, and to meet short-term financial obligations in a timely manner in both normal and stressed conditions.\n",
      "Our Liquidity Risk Management Framework includes a number of liquidity and funding policies and monitoring tools to address AIG-specific, broader industry and market related liquidity events.\n",
      "Risk Measurement\n",
      "Comprehensive cash flow projections under normal conditions are the primary component for identifying and measuring liquidity risk. We produce comprehensive liquidity projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows. In addition, we perform stress testing by identifying liquidity stress scenarios and assessing the effects of these scenarios on our cash flow and liquidity.\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "Relevant liquidity reporting is produced and reported regularly to AIG Parent and business unit risk committees. The frequency, content, and nature of reporting will vary for each business unit and legal entity, based on its complexity, risk profile, activities and size.\n",
      "Operational Risk Management\n",
      "Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss, or other adverse consequences, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or from external events. Operational risk includes legal, regulatory and compliance risks, but excludes business and strategy risks.\n",
      "Operational risk is inherent in each of our business units. Operational risks can have many impacts, including but not limited to: unexpected economic losses or gains, reputational harm due to negative publicity, regulatory action from supervisory agencies, operational and business disruptions, and/or damage to customer relationships.\n",
      "ORM oversees the Operational Risk policy and framework, which includes risk identification, assessment, prioritization, measurement, monitoring, and reporting of operational risk. As part of the framework, we deploy a series of operational risk programs to support our business units with the identification, monitoring and reporting of operational risks. The ORM programs include, but are not limited to, several key components as outlined below:\n",
      "• The Risk Event Capture process enables each employee to identify, document, and escalate operational risk impacts, with a view to enhancing, processes and promoting lessons learned.\n",
      "• The Vulnerability Identification (VID) process identifies emerging risks, which we consider to be risks that have not yet fully manifested themselves but could become significant over time.\n",
      "• The Ordinal Risk Ranking effort provides an ordinal ranking of the firm’s most significant operational risks at the Enterprise, Segment or Regional levels, with the goal of prioritizing assessment and remediation activity.\n",
      "• The Risk and Control Self-Assessments (RCSAs) allow for the identification and assessment of the key operational risks within our respective business units and a determination as to whether the related controls are effective.\n",
      "• Scenario Analyses are executed to identify the remote, but plausible, potential risks that could result in severe financial losses.\n",
      "ORM, working together with other key second lines of defense functions (e.g., Model Validation and the Technology Risk office, as well as Compliance, SOX, and Global Business Continuity), provides an independent view of Operational Risk for each business, and works with the business to facilitate implementation of the above programs. This includes coverage of operational risks related to core insurance activities, investing, model risk, technology (including cyber security, access, data\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "privacy and data security), third-party providers, as well as compliance and regulatory matters. Based on the results of the risk identification and assessment efforts above, business leaders are accountable for tracking and remediating identified issues in line with our risk monitoring procedures. Governance committees support these efforts and promote transparency and management decision making.\n",
      "Insurance Risks\n",
      "Except as described above, we manage our business risk oversight activities through our insurance operations. A primary goal in managing our insurance operations is to achieve an acceptable risk-adjusted return on equity. To achieve this goal, we must be disciplined in risk selection, premium adequacy, and appropriate terms and conditions to cover the risk accepted.\n",
      "We operate our insurance businesses on a global basis, and we are exposed to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. We manage these risks throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of procedures:\n",
      "• pre-launch approval of product design, development and distribution;\n",
      "• underwriting approval processes and authorities;\n",
      "• exposure limits with ongoing monitoring;\n",
      "• management of relationship between assets and liabilities, including hedging;\n",
      "• enhanced pricing models;\n",
      "• modeling and reporting of aggregations and limit concentrations at multiple levels (policy, line of business, product group, country, individual/group, correlation and catastrophic risk events);\n",
      "• compliance with financial reporting and capital and solvency targets;\n",
      "• use of reinsurance, both internal and third-party; and\n",
      "• review and establishment of reserves.\n",
      "We closely manage insurance risk by monitoring and controlling the nature and geographic location of the risks in each line of business underwritten, the terms and conditions of the underwriting and the premiums we charge for taking on the risk. We analyze concentrations of risk using various modeling techniques, including both probability distributions (stochastic) and/or single-point estimates (deterministic) approaches.\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "Risk Identification\n",
      "• Non-Life Insurance Companies - risks covered include property, casualty, fidelity/surety, accident and health, aviation, management liability and mortgage insurance. We manage risks in the general insurance business through aggregations and limitations of concentrations at multiple levels: policy, line of business, geography, industry and legal entity. We manage risks in the mortgage insurance business through geographic classification, risk based pricing, premium adequacy monitoring, and prudent credit policy and underwriting standards.\n",
      "• Life Insurance Companies - risks include mortality and morbidity in the insurance-oriented products and insufficient cash flows to cover contract liabilities and longevity risk in the retirement savings-oriented products. We manage risks through product design, sound medical and non-medical underwriting, and external reinsurance programs.\n",
      "We purchase reinsurance for our insurance operations. Reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. We may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis. Pooling of our reinsurance risks enables us to purchase reinsurance more efficiently at a consolidated level, manage global counterparty risk and relationships and manage global catastrophe risks, both for the Non-Life Insurance Companies and the Life Insurance Companies.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Insurance risks are monitored at the business unit level within ERM and overseen by the business unit chief risk officer, who reports directly to our CRO. The framework includes the following key components:\n",
      "• written policies that define the rules for our insurance risk-taking activities;\n",
      "• a limit framework focused on key insurance risks that aligns with our Board-approved Risk Appetite Statement; and\n",
      "• clearly defined authorities for all individuals and committee roles and responsibilities related to insurance risk management.\n",
      "Risk Measurement, Monitoring and Limits\n",
      "In addition, we monitor concentrations of exposure through insurance limits aggregated along dimensions such as geography, industry, or counterparty.\n",
      "The risk monitoring responsibilities of the business units include ensuring compliance with insurance risk limits and escalation and remediation of limit breaches. Such activities are reported to management by the relevant business unit for informative decision-making on a regular basis. This monitoring approach is aligned with our overall risk limits framework.\n",
      "Risk limits have a consistent framework used across AIG, its business units, and legal entities. This includes escalation thresholds in cases where measurement is particularly challenging.\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "See Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement - Risk Limits herein for further information on our three-tiered hierarchy of limits\n",
      "Non-Life Insurance Companies Key Insurance Risks\n",
      "We manage insurance risks through risk review and selection processes, exposure limitations, exclusions, deductibles, self-insured retentions, coverage limits, attachment points, and reinsurance. This management is supported by sound underwriting practices, pricing procedures and the use of actuarial analysis to help determine overall adequacy of provisions for insurance. Underwriting practices and pricing procedures incorporate historical experience, changes in underlying exposure, current regulation and judicial decisions as well as proposed or anticipated regulatory changes.\n",
      "For Non-Life Insurance Companies, insurance risks primarily include the following:\n",
      "• Liability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses - The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the Non-Life Insurance Companies. There is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. We manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. See Item 1. Business - A review of Liability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses herein for further information.\n",
      "• Underwriting - The potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the Non-Life Insurance Companies’ ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. This may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, worse than expected prepayment of policies, investment results, or unexpected or increased costs or expenses.\n",
      "• Catastrophe Exposure - Our business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect our operating results. Other risks, such as man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n",
      "• Single Risk Loss Exposure - Our business is exposed to loss events that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. Events such as fires or explosions can result in loss activity for our clients. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by our GRC through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance. Furthermore, single risk loss exposure is managed and monitored on both a segregated and aggregated basis.\n",
      "• Reinsurance - Since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers either due to an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event, or that actual reinsurance coverage is different than anticipated. The inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n",
      "Natural Catastrophe Risk\n",
      "We manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate Probable Maximum Loss (PML) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.\n",
      "We use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. We apply a proprietary multi-model approach to account for\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "relative strengths and weaknesses of vendor models, and make adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.\n",
      "We perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model weaknesses, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. Lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts which allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.\n",
      "We recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policy to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. For example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. In addition, we are committed to providing innovative insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change, including expanding natural disaster resilience, promoting adaptation, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Our internal product development, underwriting, modeling, and sustainability practices will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.\n",
      "Our natural catastrophe exposure is primarily driven by the U.S. and Japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries. For example, we have exposures to additional perils such as European windstorms and floods. Within the U.S., we have significant hurricane exposure in Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, Northeast U.S. and mid-Atlantic regions. Events impacting the Northeast U.S. and the mid-Atlantic may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in those regions. Within the U.S., we have significant earthquake exposure in California, the Pacific Northwest and New Madrid regions. Earthquakes impacting the Pacific Northwest and New Madrid regions may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in these regions.\n",
      "The estimates below are the Occurrence Exceedance Probability (OEP) losses, which reflect losses that may occur in any single event due to the defined peril. The 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 PMLs are the probable maximum losses from a single natural catastrophe event with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent in a year, respectively.\n",
      "The following table presents an overview of OEP modeled losses for top perils and countries.\n",
      "(a) The U.S. hurricane amount includes losses to Property from hurricane hazards of wind and storm surge.\n",
      "(b) U.S. earthquake loss estimates represent exposure to Property, Workers’ Compensation (U.S.) and A&H business lines.\n",
      "(c) Japan Earthquake represents exposure to Property and A&H business lines.\n",
      "The OEP estimates provided above reflect our in-force portfolios at September 30, 2015, for both U.S. and Japan exposures. The catastrophe reinsurance program is as of January 1, 2016.\n",
      "As noted above, AIG, along with other non-life insurance and reinsurance companies, utilizes industry-recognized catastrophe models and apply their proprietary modeling processes and assumptions to arrive at loss estimates. The use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially change the projected losses. Since there is no industry standard for assumptions and preparation of insured data for use in these models, modeled losses may not be comparable to estimates made by other companies.\n",
      "Also, the modeled results are based on the assumption that all reinsurers fulfill their obligations to us under the terms of the reinsurance arrangements and all catastrophe bonds attach and pay as modeled. However, reinsurance recoverable may not be fully collectible. In particular, the use of catastrophe bonds may not provide commensurate levels of protection compared to\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "traditional reinsurance transactions. Therefore, these estimates are inherently uncertain and may not accurately reflect our exposure to these events.\n",
      "Our 2016 catastrophe reinsurance program includes coverage for natural catastrophes and some coverage for terrorism events. It consists of a large North American occurrence cover (without reinstatement) to protect against large North America losses, and Japan occurrence and aggregate covers to protect against losses in Japan. The attachment point for this reinsurance program is at $3 billion for the North American cover and varies by line of business for the Japan covers.\n",
      "Actual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios. The occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors - Reserves and Exposures for additional information.\n",
      "Terrorism Risk\n",
      "We actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. We have set risk limits based on modeled losses from certain terrorism attack scenarios. Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model and various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the Non-Life Insurance Companies exposures. Examples of modeled scenarios are conventional bombs of different sizes, anthrax attacks and nuclear attacks.\n",
      "Our largest terrorism exposures are in New York City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers’ Compensation lines of business. At our largest exposure location, modeled losses for a five-ton bomb attack net of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (TRIPRA) and reinsurance recoveries are estimated to be $3 billion as of September 30, 2015. We also have smaller terrorism exposure in Canadian cities and in London.\n",
      "Our exposure to terrorism risk is mitigated by TRIPRA in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIPRA covers terrorist attacks within the United States or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law. In 2016, TRIPRA covers 84 percent of insured losses above a deductible, decreasing by one percent each year to 80 percent in 2020. The current estimate of our deductible is approximately $2.7 billion for 2015.\n",
      "We offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks.\n",
      "Mortgage Risk\n",
      "For Mortgage Guaranty, the potential exposure to loss is due to borrower default on a first-lien residential mortgage; the primary drivers of this risk are changes in mortgage underwriting standards, home price depreciation, changes in the unemployment rate, changes in mortgage rates, and mortgagee behavior.\n",
      "Mortgage Guaranty manages the quality of the loans it insures through use of a proprietary risk quality index. Mortgage Guaranty uses this index to determine an insurability threshold as well as to manage the risk distribution of its new business. Along with traditional mortgage underwriting variables, Mortgage Guaranty’s risk-based pricing model uses rating factors such as local housing economic conditions to establish premium rates.\n",
      "Reinsurance Recoverable\n",
      "AIG’s reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of:\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "• Paid losses recoverable - balances due from reinsurers for losses and loss adjustment expenses paid by our subsidiaries and billed, but not yet collected.\n",
      "• Ceded loss reserves - ultimate ceded reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, including reserves for claims reported but not yet paid and estimates for IBNR.\n",
      "• Ceded reserves for unearned premiums.\n",
      "At December 31, 2015, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $20.4 billion. These assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $1.2 billion, ceded loss reserves of $14.5 billion including reserves for IBNR, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $3.0 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverables of $1.7 billion. The methods used to estimate IBNR and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. These methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments are reflected in income. We believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at December 31, 2015 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. Actual losses may, however, differ, perhaps materially, from the reserves currently ceded.\n",
      "The Reinsurance Credit Department (RCD) conducts periodic detailed assessments of the financial strength and condition of current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic. The RCD monitors both the financial condition of reinsurers as well as the total reinsurance recoverable ceded to reinsurers, and set limits with regard to the amount and type or exposure we are willing to take with reinsurers. As part of these assessments, we attempt to identify whether a reinsurer is appropriately licensed, assess its financial capacity and liquidity; and evaluate the local economic and financial environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates. The RCD reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for measures, including collateral to mitigate credit risk. For example, in our treaty reinsurance contracts, we frequently include provisions that allow us to require a reinsurer to post collateral or use other measures to reduce exposure when a referenced event occurs. Furthermore, we limit our unsecured exposure to reinsurers through the use of credit triggers such as insurer financial strength rating downgrades, declines in regulatory capital, or specified declines in risk-based capital (RBC) ratios. We also set maximum limits for reinsurance recoverable exposure, which in some cases is the recoverable amount plus an estimate of the maximum potential exposure from unexpected events for a reinsurer. In addition, credit executives within ERM review reinsurer exposures and credit limits and approve reinsurer credit limits above specified levels. Finally, even where we conclude that uncollateralized credit risk is acceptable, we require collateral from active reinsurance counterparties where it is necessary for our subsidiaries to recognize the reinsurance recoverable assets for statutory accounting purposes. At December 31, 2015, we held $7.4 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers. We believe that no exposure to a single reinsurer represents an inappropriate concentration of risk to us, nor is our business substantially dependent upon any single reinsurance contract.\n",
      "The following table presents information for each reinsurer representing in excess of five percent of our total reinsurance recoverable assets:\n",
      "(a) The financial strength ratings reflect the ratings of the various reinsurance subsidiaries of the companies listed as of February 5, 2016.\n",

      "(d) Includes $1.8 billion recoverable under the 2011 retroactive reinsurance transaction pursuant to which a large portion of the Non-Life Insurance Companies net domestic asbestos liabilities were transferred to NICO. Does not include reinsurance assets ceded to other reinsurers for which NICO has assumed the collection risk. See Liability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses - Transfer of Domestic Asbestos Liabilities.\n",
      "At December 31, 2015, we had no significant general reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. Reinsurer capital levels continued to increase in 2015, thereby increasing the industry’s underwriting capacity. This increased capacity has resulted in increased competition and lower rates for 2016 renewals. Reduced profitability associated with lower rates could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers.\n",

      "Life Insurance Companies Key Insurance Risks\n",
      "Our Retirement and Life segments manage risk through product design, experience monitoring, pricing actions, risk limitations, reinsurance and active monitoring and management of the relationships between assets and liabilities, including hedging.\n",
      "For our Retirement and Life products offered by the Life Insurance Companies, key insurance risks include the following:\n",
      "• Mortality risk - represents the risk of loss arising from actual mortality rates being higher than expected mortality rates. This risk could arise from pandemics or other events, including longer-term societal changes that cause higher than expected mortality. This risk exists in a number of our product lines, but is most significant for our life insurance products.\n",
      "• Longevity risk - represents the risk of a change in value of a policy or benefit as a result of actual mortality rates being lower than the expected mortality rates. This risk could arise from longer-term societal health changes as well as other factors. This risk exists in a number of our product lines but is most significant for our retirement, institutional and annuity products.\n",
      "• Policyholder behavior risk including surrender/lapse risk - represents the risk that actual policyholder behavior differs from expected behavior in a manner that has an adverse effect on our results of operations. There are many assumptions made when products are sold, including how long the contracts will persist. Actual experience can vary significantly from these assumptions. This risk is impacted by a number of factors including changes in market conditions, especially interest rate and equity market changes, tax law, regulations and policyholder preferences. This risk exists in the majority of our product lines.\n",
      "• Interest rate risk - represents the potential for loss due to a change in interest rates. Interest rate risk is measured with respect to assets, liabilities (both insurance-related and financial) and derivatives. This risk manifests itself when interest rates move significantly in a short period of time. Rapidly rising interest rates create the potential for increased surrenders. Interest rate risk can also manifest itself over a longer period of time, such as in a persistent low interest rate environment. Low long-term interest rates put pressure on investment returns, which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products.\n",
      "• Equity risk - represents the potential for loss due to changes in equity prices. It affects equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities (and associated guaranteed living and death benefits, as discussed below), universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance. In addition, changes in the volatility of equity prices can affect the valuation of insurance features that are accounted for as embedded derivatives and the related economic hedges.\n",
      "The emergence of significant adverse experience compared to the initial assumptions at policy issuance or updated assumption would require an adjustment to DAC and benefit reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for a particular period. For additional discussion of the impact of actual and expected experience on DAC and benefit reserves, see Critical Accounting Estimates - Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health (Life Insurance Companies) and Critical Accounting Estimates - Guaranteed Benefit Features of Variable Annuity Products (Life Insurance Companies). For additional discussion of business risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Business and Operations.\n",
      "Variable Annuity Risk Management and Hedging Program\n",
      "Our Retirement Income Solutions and Group Retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with riders that guarantee a certain level of benefits. Certain guaranteed living benefits, which include GMWB and GMAB, are accounted for as\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses). GMWB and GMAB features subject the Life Insurance Companies to market risk, including exposure to changes in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility.\n",
      "Variable annuity product design is the first step in managing our exposure to these market risks. Risk mitigation features of our variable annuity product design include GMWB rider fees indexed to an equity market volatility index, which can provide additional fee assessments in periods of market volatility, required minimum allocations to fixed accounts to reduce overall equity exposure, and the utilization of volatility control funds, which reduce equity exposure in the funds in response to changes in market volatility, even under sudden or extreme market movements.\n",
      "After reflecting our product risk-mitigating features, we hedge our remaining economic exposure to market risk within GMWB and GMAB features through our variable annuity hedging program, which is designed to offset certain changes in the economic value of these GMWB and GMAB embedded derivatives, within established thresholds. The hedging program is designed to provide additional protection against large and combined movements in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility under multiple scenarios.\n",
      "Our hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents our estimate of the underlying economic drivers of these embedded derivatives, based on the present value of the future expected benefit payments for the GMWB and GMAB, less the present value of future rider fees, over numerous stochastic scenarios. This stochastic projection method uses best estimate assumptions for policyholder behavior (including mortality, lapses, withdrawals and benefit utilization) in conjunction with market scenarios calibrated to observable equity and interest rate option prices. Policyholder behaviors are regularly evaluated to compare current assumptions to actual experience and, if appropriate, changes are made to the policyholder behavior assumptions. The risk of changes in policyholder behavior is not explicitly hedged and such differences between expected and actual policyholder behaviors may result in hedge ineffectiveness.\n",
      "Due to differences between the calculation of the economic hedge target and U.S. GAAP valuation of the embedded derivative, which include differences in the treatment of rider fees and exclusion of certain risk margins and other differences in discount rates, we expect relative movements in the economic hedge target and the U.S. GAAP embedded derivative valuation will vary over time with changes in equity markets, interest rates and credit spreads. See Results of Operations - Life Insurance Companies DAC and Reserves - Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefit Features and Hedging Program for information on the impact on our consolidated pre-tax income from the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives and the hedging portfolio, as well as additional discussion of differences between the economic hedge target and the valuation of the embedded derivatives.\n",
      "In designing our hedging portfolio, we make assumptions and projections about the future performance of the underlying contract holder funds. To project future account value changes, we make assumptions about how each of the underlying funds will perform. We map the contract holder funds to a set of publicly traded indices that we believe best represent the liability to be hedged. Basis risk exists due to the variance between these assumptions and actual fund returns, which may result in variances between changes in the hedging portfolio and changes in the economic hedge target. Net hedge results and the cost of hedging are also impacted by differences between realized volatility and implied volatility.\n",
      "To manage the capital market exposures embedded within the economic hedge target, we identify and hedge market sensitivities to changes in equity markets, interest rates, volatility and credit spreads. The hedge program purchases derivative instruments or securities having sensitivities that offset those in the economic hedge target, within internally defined threshold levels. Since the relative movements of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target vary over time or with market changes, the net exposure can be outside the threshold limits, and adjustments to the hedging portfolio are made periodically to return the net exposure to within threshold limits.\n",
      "Our hedging program utilizes various derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts, interest rate swaps and swaption contracts, as well as other hedging instruments. In addition, we purchase certain fixed income securities and elect the fair value option as a capital efficient way to manage interest rate and credit spread exposures. To minimize counterparty credit risk, the majority of our derivative instrument hedges are implemented using exchange-traded futures and options, cleared through global exchanges. Over the counter derivatives are highly collateralized.\n",
      "The hedging program is monitored on a daily basis to ensure that the economic hedge target and derivative portfolio are within the threshold limits, pursuant to the approved hedge strategy. Daily risk monitoring verifies that the net risk exposures, as measured through sensitivities to a large set of market shocks, are within the approved net risk exposure threshold limits. In addition, monthly stress tests are performed to determine the program’s effectiveness relative to the applicable limits, under an\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "array of combined severe market stresses in equity prices, interest rates, volatility and credit spreads. Finally, hedge strategies are reviewed regularly to gauge their effectiveness in managing our market exposures in the context of our overall risk appetite.\n",
      "Other Operations Risks\n",
      "Derivative Transactions\n",
      "We utilize derivatives principally to enable us to hedge exposure to interest rates, currencies, credit, commodities, equities and other risks. Credit risk associated with derivative counterparties exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to us. The maximum potential exposure will increase or decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions. All derivative transactions must be transacted within counterparty limits that have been approved by ERM.\n",
      "We evaluate counterparty credit quality by internal analysis consistent with the AIG Credit Policy. We utilize various credit enhancements, including letters of credit, guarantees, collateral, credit triggers, credit derivatives, margin agreements and subordination to reduce the credit risk relating to outstanding financial derivative transactions. We require credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties, and transaction size and maturity. Furthermore, we enter into certain agreements that have the benefit of set-off and close-out netting provisions, such as ISDA Master Agreements. These provisions provide that, in the case of an early termination of a transaction, we can set off receivables from a counterparty against payables to the same counterparty arising out of all covered transactions. As a result, where a legally enforceable netting agreement exists, the fair value of the transaction with the counterparty represents the net sum of estimated fair values.\n",
      "The fair value of our interest rate, currency, credit, commodity and equity swaps, options, swaptions, and forward commitments, futures, and forward contracts reported as a component of Other Assets, was approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2015 and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2014.

The standard also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties and additional disclosures. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, based on technical merits, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recognized in the financial statements.

      "is particularly true for long-tail casualty classes of business such as excess casualty, asbestos, D&O, and primary or excess workers’ compensation.\n",
      "All of our methods to calculate net reserves include assumptions about estimated reinsurance recoveries and their collectability. Reinsurance collectability is evaluated independently of the reserving process and appropriate allowances for uncollectible reinsurance are established.\n",
      "In some of our estimation processes we rely on the claims department estimates of our case reserves as an input to our best estimate of the ultimate loss cost.\n",
      "Overview of Loss Reserving Process and Methods\n",
      "The Non-Life Insurance Companies’ loss reserves can generally be categorized into two distinct groups. Short-tail classes of business consist principally of property, Personal Insurance and certain casualty classes. Long-tail casualty classes of business include excess and umbrella liability, D&O, professional liability, medical malpractice, workers’ compensation, general liability, products liability and related classes.\n",
      "Short-Tail Reserves\n",
      "For operations writing short-tail coverages, where the nature of claims is low frequency and high severity such as property, the process for recording non-catastrophe quarterly loss reserves for more recent accident quarters is geared toward maintaining incurred but not reported reserves (IBNR) based on percentages of net earned premiums for that business, rather than projecting ultimate loss ratios based on reported losses. For example, the IBNR reserve required for the latest accident quarter for a class of property business might be approximately 20 percent of the quarter’s earned premiums. This level of reserve would generally be recorded regardless of the actual losses reported in the current quarter. The percent of premium factor reflects both our expectation of the ultimate loss costs associated with the class of business and the expectation of the percentage of ultimate loss costs that have not yet been reported. The expected ultimate loss costs generally reflect the average loss costs from a period of preceding accident quarters that have been adjusted for changes in rate and loss cost levels, mix of business, known exposure to unreported losses, or other factors affecting the particular class of business. The expected percentage of ultimate loss costs that have not yet been reported would be derived from historical loss emergence patterns. For more mature quarters, loss development methods would be used to determine the IBNR. For other classes where the nature of claims is high frequency low severity, methods including loss development, frequency/severity or a multiple of average monthly losses may be used to determine IBNR reserves. IBNR for claims arising from catastrophic events or events of unusual severity would be determined in close collaboration with the claims department, using alternative techniques or expected percentages of ultimate loss cost emergence based on historical loss emergence of similar claim types.\n",
      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "Long-Tail Reserves\n",
      "Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss adjustment expenses (net losses) for long-tail casualty classes of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the class and volume of business, as well as estimates of the reinsurance recoverable. Experience in the more recent accident years shows limited statistical credibility in reported net losses on long-tail casualty classes of business. That is because a relatively low proportion of net incurred losses represents reported claims and expenses, and an even smaller percentage represents net losses paid. Therefore, IBNR constitutes a relatively high proportion of net losses.\n",
      "To estimate net losses for long-tail casualty classes\n",
      "of business, we\n",
      "use a variety of actuarial methods and assumptions.\n",
      "To estimate net losses for long-tail casualty classes of business, we use a variety of actuarial methods and assumptions and other analytical techniques as described below. A detailed reserve review is generally performed at least once per year to allow for comprehensive actuarial evaluation and collaboration with claims, underwriting, business unit management, risk management and senior management.\n",
      "We generally make a number of actuarial assumptions in the review of reserves for each class of business.\n",
      "We record quarterly changes in loss reserves for each of the Non-Life Insurance Companies classes of business. The overall change in our loss reserves is based on the sum of the changes for all classes of business. For most long-tail classes of business, the quarterly loss reserve changes are based on the estimated current loss ratio for each class of coverage less any amounts paid. Also, any change in estimated ultimate losses from prior accident years deemed to be necessary based on the results of our latest reserve studies or large loss analysis, either positive or negative, is reflected in the loss reserve for the current quarter. Differences between actual loss emergence in a given period compared to our expectations may also influence our judgment with respect to reserve adequacy.\n",
      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "Details of the Loss Reserving Process\n",
      "The process of determining the current loss ratio for each class of business is based on a variety of factors. These include considerations such as: prior accident year and policy year loss ratios; rate changes; and changes in coverage, reinsurance, or mix of business. Other considerations include actual and anticipated changes in external factors such as trends in loss costs, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, inflation, employment rates or unemployment duration, stock market volatility, corporate bond spreads, or in the legal and claims environment. The current loss ratio for each class of business is intended to represent our best estimate of the current loss ratio after reflecting all of the relevant factors. At the close of each quarter, the assumptions underlying the loss ratios are reviewed to determine if the loss ratios remain appropriate. This process includes a review of the actual claims experience in the quarter, actual rate changes achieved, actual changes in coverage, reinsurance or mix of business, and changes in other factors that may affect the loss ratio. When this review suggests that the initially determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate, the loss ratio for current business is changed to reflect the revised assumptions.\n",
      "We conduct a comprehensive loss reserve review at least annually for each class of business in accordance with Actuarial Standards of Practice. These standards provide that the unpaid claim estimate may be presented in a variety of ways, such as a point estimate, a range of estimates, a point estimate based on the expected value of several reasonable estimates, or a probability distribution of the unpaid claim amount. Further, the actuarial central estimate represents an expected value using the range of reasonably possible outcomes.\n",
      "The reserve analysis for each class of business is performed by the actuarial personnel who are most familiar with that class of business. In this process, the actuaries are required to make numerous assumptions, including the selection of loss development factors and loss cost trend factors. They are also required to determine and select the most appropriate actuarial methods for each business class. Additionally, they must determine the segmentation of data that will enable the most suitable test of reserve adequacy. In the course of these detailed reserve reviews an actuarial central estimate of the loss reserve is determined. The sum of these central estimates for each class of business provides an overall actuarial central estimate of the loss reserve for that class.\n",
      "We selected our central estimate based on point estimates from each method with weights that vary by accident year. In 2015, we began developing our ranges of reasonable estimates for certain classes by evaluating ranges derived from multiple methodologies. We considered the range of reasonable parameter selections (for example, three-year versus ten-year average loss development factors) for each appropriate method and calculated a range of indications for each method. Where we have ranges, we assess the position of the actuarial central estimate in the range to help inform management’s decision making. The range of reasonable estimates are not intended to cover all possibilities or extreme values.\n",
      "We continue to consult with third party environmental litigation and engineering specialists, third party toxic tort claims professionals, third party clinical and public health specialists, third party workers’ compensation claims adjusters and third party actuarial advisors to help inform our judgments. In 2015, the third party actuarial reviews covered the majority of net reserves held for our Commercial long-tail classes of business, and run-off portfolios reported in Corporate and Other.\n",
      "A critical component of our detailed valuation reviews is our peer review of our reserving analyses and conclusions, where actuaries independent of the initial review evaluate the reasonableness of assumptions used, methods selected and weightings given to different methods. In addition, each detailed valuation review is subjected to a challenge process by specialists in our Enterprise Risk Management group.\n",
      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "Loss reserve development can also be affected by commutations of assumed and ceded reinsurance agreements.\n",
      "Actuarial and Other Methods for Major Classes of Business\n",
      "In testing the reserves for each class of business, our actuaries determine the most appropriate actuarial methods. This determination is based on a variety of factors including the nature of the claims associated with the class of business, such as the frequency or severity of the claims. Other considerations include the loss development characteristics associated with the claims, the volume of claim data available for the applicable class, and the applicability of various actuarial methods to the class. In addition to determining the actuarial methods, the actuaries determine the appropriate loss reserve groupings of data. For example, we write many unique subclasses of professional liability. For pricing or other purposes, it is appropriate to evaluate the profitability of each subclass individually. However, for purposes of estimating the loss reserves for many classes of business, we believe it is appropriate to combine the subclasses into larger groups to produce a greater degree of credibility in the claims experience. This determination of data segmentation and actuarial methods is carefully considered for each class of business. The segmentation and actuarial methods chosen are those which together are expected to produce the most robust central estimate of the loss reserves.\n",
      "The actuarial methods we use for most long-tail casualty classes of business include loss development methods, expected loss ratio methods, including “Bornhuetter Ferguson” methods described below, and frequency/severity models. Loss development methods utilize the actual loss development patterns from prior accident years to project the reported losses to an ultimate basis for subsequent accident years. Loss development methods generally are most appropriate for classes of business which exhibit a stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next, and for which the components of the classes have similar development characteristics. For example, property exposures would generally not be combined into the same class as casualty exposures, and primary casualty exposures would generally not be combined into the same class as excess casualty exposures. In 2015, we continued to refine our loss reserving techniques for the domestic primary casualty classes of business and adopted further segmentations based on our analysis of the differing emerging loss patterns for certain classes of insureds. We generally use expected loss ratio methods in cases where the reported loss data lacks sufficient credibility to utilize loss development methods, such as for new classes of business or for long-tail classes at early stages of loss development. Frequency/severity models may be used where sufficient frequency counts are available to apply such approaches.\n",
      "Expected loss ratio methods rely on the application of an expected loss ratio to the earned premium for the class of business to determine the loss reserves. For example, an expected loss ratio of 70 percent applied to an earned premium base of $10 million for a class of business would generate an ultimate loss estimate of $7 million. Subtracting any reported paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve for this class. Under the “Bornhuetter Ferguson” methods, the expected loss ratio is applied only to the expected unreported portion of the losses. For example, for a\n",
      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "long-tail class of business for which only 10 percent of the losses are expected to be reported at the end of the accident year, the expected loss ratio would be applied to the 90 percent of the losses still unreported. The actual reported losses at the end of the accident year would be added to determine the total ultimate loss estimate for the accident year. Subtracting the reported paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve. In the example above, the expected loss ratio of 70 percent would be multiplied by 90 percent. The result of 63 percent would be applied to the earned premium of $10 million resulting in an estimated unreported loss of $6.3 million. Actual reported losses would be added to arrive at the total ultimate losses. If the reported losses were $1 million, the ultimate loss estimate under the “Bornhuetter Ferguson” method would be $7.3 million versus the $7 million amount under the expected loss ratio method described above. Thus, the “Bornhuetter Ferguson” method gives partial credibility to the actual loss experience to date for the class of business. Loss development methods generally give full credibility to the reported loss experience to date. In the example above, loss development methods would typically indicate an ultimate loss estimate of $10 million, as the reported losses of $1 million would be estimated to reflect only 10 percent of the ultimate losses.\n",
      "A key advantage of loss development methods is that they respond more quickly to any actual changes in loss costs for the class of business. Therefore, if loss experience is unexpectedly deteriorating or improving, the loss development method gives full credibility to the changing experience. Expected loss ratio methods would be slower to respond to the change, as they would continue to give more weight to the expected loss ratio, until enough evidence emerged to modify the expected loss ratio to reflect the changing loss experience. On the other hand, loss development methods have the disadvantage of overreacting to changes in reported losses if the loss experience is not credible. For example, the presence or absence of large losses at the early stages of loss development could cause the loss development method to overreact to the favorable or unfavorable experience by assuming it will continue at later stages of development. In these instances, expected loss ratio methods such as “Bornhuetter Ferguson” have the advantage of recognizing large losses without extrapolating unusual large loss activity onto the unreported portion of the losses for the accident year.\n",
      "Frequency/severity methods generally rely on the determination of an ultimate number of claims and an average severity for each claim for each accident year. Multiplying the estimated ultimate number of claims for each accident year by the expected average severity of each claim produces the estimated ultimate loss for the accident year. Frequency/severity methods generally require a sufficient volume of claims in order for the average severity to be predictable. Average severity for subsequent accident years is generally determined by applying an estimated annual loss cost trend to the estimated average claim severity from prior accident years. In certain cases, a structural approach may also be used to predict the ultimate loss cost. Frequency/severity methods have the advantage that ultimate claim counts can generally be estimated more quickly and accurately than can ultimate losses. Thus, if the average claim severity can be accurately estimated, these methods can more quickly respond to changes in loss experience than other methods. However, for average severity to be predictable, the class of business must consist of homogeneous types of claims for which loss severity trends from one year to the next are reasonably consistent. Generally these methods work best for high frequency, low severity classes of business such as personal auto.\n",
      "Structural drivers analytics seek to explain the underlying drivers of frequency/severity. A structural drivers analysis of frequency/severity is particularly useful for understanding the key drivers of uncertainty in the ultimate loss cost. For example, for the excess workers’ compensation class of business, we have attempted to corroborate our judgment by considering the impact on severity of the future propensity for deterioration of an injured worker’s medical condition, the impact of price inflation on the various categories of medical expense and cost of living adjustments on indemnity benefits, the impact of injured worker mortality and claim specific settlement and loss mitigation strategies, etc., using the following:\n",
      "• Claim by claim reviews to determine the stability and likelihood of settling an injured worker’s indemnity and medical benefits - the claim file review was facilitated by third party specialists experienced in workers’ compensation claims;\n",
      "• Analysis of the potential for future deterioration in medical condition unlikely to be picked up by a claim file review and associated with potentially costly medical procedures (i.e., increases in both utilization and intensity of medical care) over the course of the injured worker’s lifetime;\n",
      "• Analysis of the cost of medical price inflation for each category of medical spend (services and devices) and for cost of living adjustments in line with statutory requirements;\n",
      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "• Portfolio specific mortality level and mortality improvement assumptions based on a mortality study conducted for AIG’s primary and excess workers’ compensation portfolios and AIG’s opinion of future longevity trends for the open reported cases;\n",
      "• Ground-up consideration of the reinsurance recoveries expected for the class of business for reported claims with extrapolation for unreported claims; and\n",
      "• The effects of various run-off claims management strategies that have been developed by AIG’s run-off unit.\n",
      "During 2015, we continued to expand our analysis of structural drivers as a means of corroborating our judgments using traditional actuarial techniques. For example, we have considered the impact of changes in economic activity (real GDP growth, which can impact levels of trucking activity) on our emerging experience in the Commercial Auto Liability class of business, particularly business written in excess of a large insured deductible where ground up experience may take several years to reach our layer. Further, we considered the impact of expected levels of future inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Deflator (Health Services Component) published by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis on our ultimate loss costs for medical benefits in the primary workers’ compensation class of business. We believe the PCE Deflator provides a more appropriate measure of workers’ compensation medical inflation as it includes medical expenditures made by employers on behalf of their employees. We also tested the sensitivity of our estimates to changes in the future path and level of inflation for this class of business.\n",
      "Overall, our loss reserve reviews for long-tail classes typically utilize a combination of both loss development and expected loss ratio methods, supplemented by structural drivers analysis of frequency/severity where available. Loss development methods are generally given more weight for accident years and classes of business where the loss experience is highly credible. Expected loss ratio methods are given more weight where the reported loss experience is less credible, or is driven more by large losses. Expected loss ratio methods require sufficient information to determine the appropriate expected loss ratio. This information generally includes the actual loss ratios for prior accident years, and rate changes as well as underwriting or other changes which would affect the loss ratio. Further, an estimate of the loss cost trend or loss ratio trend is required to allow for the effect of inflation and other factors which may increase or otherwise change the loss costs from one accident year to the next.\n",
      "The estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims. This is due to inconsistent court decisions, as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies or have expanded theories of liability. In addition, reinsurance recoverable balances relating to asbestos and environmental loss reserves are subject to greater uncertainty due to the underlying age of the claim, underlying legal issues surrounding the nature of the coverage, and determination of proper policy period. For these reasons, these balances tend to be subject to increased levels of disputes and legal collection activity when actually billed. The insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures.\n",
      "We continue to receive claims asserting injuries and damages from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged claims to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites, referred to collectively as environmental claims, and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. The vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained absolute exclusions for pollution-related damage and asbestos. The current Non-Life Insurance Companies environmental policies that we specifically price and underwrite for environmental risks on a claims-made basis have been excluded from the analysis.\n",
      "The majority of our exposures for asbestos and environmental claims are related to excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. The litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity amounts, with litigation expenses included within the limits of the liability we incur. Individual significant claim liabilities, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case-by-case basis.\n",

      "Reserve Estimation for Asbestos and Environmental Claims\n",
      "Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a subjective process. Reserves for asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated using conventional reserving techniques such as those that rely on historical accident year loss development factors. The methods used to determine asbestos and environmental loss estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated by management.\n",
      "Various factors contribute to the complexity and difficulty in determining the future development of claims. Significant factors that influence the claims estimation process include court resolutions and judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage. The current case law can be characterized as still evolving, and there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop in the near future. Additionally, the exposures for cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites involve issues such as allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and the government’s refusal to release parties from liability. Future claims development also will be affected by the changes in Superfund and waste dump site coverage and liability issues.\n",
      "If the asbestos and environmental reserves develop adversely, resulting deficiencies could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations for an individual reporting period.\n",
      "With respect to known environmental claims, over two decades ago we established a specialized environmental claims unit, which investigates and adjusts all such environmental claims. This unit evaluates environmental claims utilizing a claim-by-claim approach that involves a detailed review of individual policy terms and exposures. Because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, we generally evaluate exposure on a policy-by-policy basis, considering a variety of factors such as known facts, current law, jurisdiction, policy language and other factors that are unique to each policy. Quantitative techniques must be supplemented by subjective considerations, including management judgment. Each claim is reviewed at least semi-annually utilizing the aforementioned approach and adjusted as necessary to reflect the current information.\n",
      "The environmental claims unit also actively manages and pursues early resolution with respect to these claims in an attempt to mitigate our exposure to the unpredictable development of these claims. We attempt to mitigate our known long-tail environmental exposures through a combination of proactive claim-resolution techniques, including policy buybacks, complete environmental releases, compromise settlements, and, when appropriate, litigation.\n",
      "Known asbestos claims are managed in a similar manner. Over two decades ago we established a specialized toxic tort claims unit, which historically investigated and adjusted all such asbestos claims. As part of the above mentioned NICO transaction, effective January 1, 2011, NICO assumed responsibility for claims handling related to the majority of AIG’s domestic asbestos liabilities.\n",

      "Alternative Loss Cost Trend and Loss Development Factor Assumptions by Class of Business\n",
      "Two of our most significant assumptions in loss-based methodologies are those for loss cost trends and loss development factors. There is generally some potential for deviation from our selected best estimate assumptions related to loss cost trends and loss development factor assumptions. The classes noted below are considered to have a higher sensitivity to changes in these assumptions than other classes. For example, primary auto liability reserves were impacted by changes in the frequency and severity of losses in recent years which may not be captured by sensitivities of the parameter modeled below.\n",
      "The sensitivity analysis below addresses each major class of business for which there is a possibility of a material deviation from our overall reserve position as a result of changes in these individual assumptions. The analysis uses a range of potential alternative assumptions for each class based on historical experience. Actual reserve development may not be consistent with either the original or the alternative loss trend or loss development factor assumptions, and other assumptions made in the reserving process may materially affect reserve development for a particular class of business.\n",
      "It should be noted that there are many other assumptions used in the loss reserving process, and the sensitivities shown below are not intended to be indications of possible loss reserve ranges for the class but merely illustrations of the sensitivity of the reserves to certain alternative assumptions considered individually. The actual reserve range is a function of many factors interacting with each other.\n",
      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "Loss cost trends: The percentage deviations noted in the table below are not considered the highest possible deviations that might be expected, but rather what we consider to reflect a reasonably likely range of potential deviation based on historical loss cost trends. The impacts cited below are only for the years for which we used an expected loss ratio approach. Actual loss cost trends in the early 1990s were negative for several years whereas actual loss cost trends exceeded the figures cited below for 1997 through 2001. These observed variations were considered in establishing the percentage deviations, and result in asymmetrical selections. Loss trends may deviate by more than the amounts noted above and discussed below.\n",
      "Loss development factors: The percentage deviations noted in the table below are not considered the highest possible deviations that might be expected, but rather what we consider to reflect a reasonably likely range of potential deviation. While multiple scenarios are performed, the assumed loss development factors are a key assumption. Generally, actual historical loss development factors are used to project future loss development. Future loss development patterns may be different from those in the past, or may deviate by more than the amounts noted above and discussed below. Further, there is a greater incidence of these factors increasing, which is reflected in the deviations selected.\n",
      "A large portion of the loss reserves from the Non-Life Insurance Companies business relates to longer-tail casualty classes of business, such as excess casualty and D&O, which are driven by severity rather than frequency of claims. Using the reserving methodologies described above, our actuaries determine their actuarial central estimates of the loss reserves and advise management on their final recommendation for management’s best estimate of the recorded reserves. Subject matter experts from underwriting and claims play an important part in informing the actuarial assumptions and methods. The governance process over the establishment of loss reserves also ensures robust considerations of the changes in the loss trends, terms and conditions, claims handling practices, and large loss impact when determining the methods, assumptions and the estimations. This multi-disciplinary process engages underwriting, claims, risk management, business unit executives and senior management and involves several iterative levels of feedback and response during the regular reserving process.\n",
      "The following sensitivity analysis table summarizes the effect on the loss reserve position of using certain alternative loss cost trend (for accident years where we use expected loss ratio methods) or loss development factor assumptions rather than the assumptions actually used in determining our estimates in the year-end loss reserve analyses in 2015.\n",

      "Reinsurance Assets\n",
      "The estimation of reinsurance recoverable involves a significant amount of judgment, particularly for latent exposures, such as asbestos, due to their long-tail nature. Reinsurance assets include reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses that are estimated as part of our loss reserving process and, consequently, are subject to similar judgments and uncertainties as the estimation of gross loss reserves.\n",
      "We assess the collectability of reinsurance recoverable balances through either detailed reviews of the underlying nature of the reinsurance balance or comparisons with historical trends of disputes and credit events. We record adjustments to reflect the results of these assessments through an allowance for uncollectable reinsurance that reduces the carrying amount of reinsurance assets in the balance sheet. This estimate requires significant judgment for which key considerations include:\n",
      "• paid and unpaid amounts recoverable;\n",
      "• whether the balance is in dispute or subject to legal collection;\n",
      "• whether the reinsurer is financially troubled (i.e., liquidated, insolvent, in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction); and\n",
      "• whether collateral and collateral arrangements exist.\n",
      "At December 31, 2015, the allowance for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance was $272 million.\n",

      "Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health Insurance Contracts (Life Insurance Companies)\n",
      "Long-duration traditional products include whole life insurance, term life insurance, accident and health insurance, long-term care insurance, and certain payout annuities for which the payment period is life-contingent, which include certain of our single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements.\n",
      "For long-duration traditional business, a “lock-in” principle applies. The assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. The assumptions include mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses, and investment returns. These assumptions are typically consistent with pricing inputs. The assumptions also include margins for adverse deviation, principally for key assumptions such as mortality and interest rates used to discount cash flows, to reflect uncertainty given that actual experience might deviate from these assumptions. Establishing margins at contract inception requires management judgment. The extent of the margin for adverse deviation may vary depending on the uncertainty of the cash flows, which is affected by the volatility of the business and the extent of our experience with the product.\n",
      "Loss recognition occurs if observed changes in actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses under loss recognition testing. To determine whether loss recognition exists, we determine whether a future loss is expected based on updated current assumptions. If loss recognition exists, we recognize the loss by first reducing DAC through amortization expense, and, if DAC is depleted, record additional liabilities through a charge to policyholder benefit expense. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on loss recognition. Because of the long-term nature of many of our liabilities subject to the “lock-in” principle, small changes in certain assumptions may cause large changes in the degree of reserve adequacy. In particular, changes in estimates of future invested asset returns have a large effect on the degree of reserve deficiency.\n",
      "Groupings for loss recognition testing are consistent with our manner of acquiring, servicing, and measuring the profitability of the business and applied by product groupings. We perform separate loss recognition tests for traditional life products, payout annuities, and long-term care insurance. Once loss recognition has been recorded for a block of business, the old assumption set is replaced and the assumption set used for the loss recognition would then be subject to the lock-in principle. Key judgments made in loss recognition testing include the following:\n",
      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "• To determine investment returns used in loss recognition tests, we typically segregate assets that match the duration of our liabilities with assets of comparable duration, to the extent practicable, and then project future cash flows on those assets. Assets supporting insurance liabilities are primarily comprised of a diversified portfolio of high quality fixed maturity securities, and may also include, to a lesser extent, alternative investments. Our projections include a reasonable allowance for investment expenses and expected credit losses over the projection horizon. A critical assumption in the projection of expected investment income is the assumed net rate of investment return at which excess cash flows are to be reinvested. For products in which asset and liability durations are matched relatively well, this is less of a consideration since interest on excess cash flows are not a significant component of future cash flows. For the reinvestment rate assumption, anticipated future changes to the yield curves could have a large effect. Given the interest rate environment applicable at the date of our most recent loss recognition tests, we assumed a modest and gradual increase in long-term interest rates over time.\n",
      "• For mortality assumptions, key judgments include the extent of industry versus own experience to base future assumptions as well as the extent of expected mortality improvements in the future. The latter judgment is based on a combination of historical mortality trends and advice from industry, public health and demography specialists that were consulted by AIG’s actuaries and published industry information.\n",
      "• For surrender rates, a key judgment involves the correlation between expected increases/decreases in interest rates and increases/decreases in surrender rates. To support this judgment, we compare crediting rates on our products relative to expected rates on competing products under different interest rate scenarios.\n",
      "• For in-force long-term care insurance, rate increases are allowed but must be approved by state insurance regulators. Consequently, the extent of rate increases that may be assumed requires judgment. In establishing our assumption for rate increases for long-term care insurance, we consider historical experience as to the frequency and level of rate increases approved by state regulators.\n",
      "The Life operating segment recorded loss recognition expense of $28 million in 2015 and $87 million in 2014 to increase reserves for certain discontinued long-term care business due to the update of actuarial assumptions, primarily a result of lower future premium increase assumptions and, in 2014, lower yield assumptions. Sales of investment securities in connection with our program to utilize capital loss carryforwards and other investment sales with subsequent reinvestment at lower yields triggered recording of loss recognition expense of $30 million and $1.5 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily related to certain long-term payout annuity contracts in the Institutional Markets and Retirement operating segments.\n",
      "Significant unrealized appreciation on investments in a prolonged low interest rate environment may cause DAC to be adjusted and additional future policy benefit liabilities to be recorded through a charge directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (“shadow loss recognition”). These charges are included, net of tax, with the change in net unrealized appreciation of investments. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on shadow loss recognition. In applying shadow loss recognition, the Company overlays unrealized gains onto loss recognition tests without revising the underlying test. Accordingly, there is limited additional judgment in this process.\n",
      "Guaranteed Benefit Features of Variable Annuity Products (Life Insurance Companies)\n",
      "Variable annuity products offered by our Retirement Income Solutions and Group Retirement product lines offer guaranteed benefit features. These guaranteed features include guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) that are payable in the event of death or other instances, and living benefits that are payable in the event of annuitization, or, in other instances, at specified dates during the accumulation period. Living benefits include guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB), guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB), and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (GMAB). See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these features.\n",
      "The liabilities for GMDB and GMIB, which are recorded in Future policyholder benefits, represent the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account value, with the excess recognized ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected fee assessments, through Policyholder benefits and losses incurred. The liabilities for GMWB and GMAB, which are recorded in Policyholder contract deposits, are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value of the liabilities recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses).\n",
      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "Our exposure to the guaranteed amounts is equal to the amount by which the contract holder’s account balance is below the amount provided by the guaranteed feature. A variable annuity contract may include more than one type of guaranteed benefit feature; for example, it may have both a GMDB and a GMWB. However, a policyholder can generally only receive payout from one guaranteed feature on a contract containing a death benefit and a living benefit, i.e. the features are mutually exclusive, so the exposure to the guaranteed amount for each feature is independent of the exposure from other features (except a surviving spouse who has a rider to potentially collect both a GMDB upon their spouse’s death and a GMWB during their lifetime). A policyholder cannot purchase more than one living benefit on one contract. Declines in the equity markets, increased volatility and a sustained low interest rate environment increase our exposure to potential benefits under the guaranteed features, leading to an increase in the liabilities for those benefits. See Estimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products (Life Insurance) below for sensitivity analysis which includes the sensitivity of reserves for guaranteed benefit features to changes in the assumptions for interest rates, equity market returns, volatility, and mortality. For additional discussion of market risk management related to these product features, see Enterprise Risk Management - Life Insurance Companies Key Insurance Risks - Variable Annuity Risk Management and Hedging Program.\n",
      "The reserving methodology and assumptions used to measure the liabilities of our two largest guaranteed benefit features are presented in the following table:\n",
      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "Estimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products (Life Insurance Companies)\n",
      "Policy acquisition costs and policy issuance costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal of existing insurance contracts related to universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) are generally deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over a period that approximates the estimated lives of the contracts, except in instances where significant negative gross profits are expected in one or more periods. Estimated gross profits include net investment income and spreads, net realized investment gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses, and mortality gains and losses. In estimating future gross profits, lapse assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on DAC amortization. For fixed deferred annuity contracts, the future spread between investment income and interest credited to policyholders is a significant judgment, particularly in a low interest rate environment.\n",
      "If the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC and related reserves, including VOBA, SIA, guaranteed benefit reserves and URR, are recalculated using the new assumptions, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. Updating such assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.\n",
      "In estimating future gross profits for variable annuity products, a long-term annual asset growth assumption of 8.5% (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected) is applied to estimate the future growth in assets and related asset-based fees. In determining the asset growth rate, the effect of short-term fluctuations in the equity markets is partially mitigated through the use of a reversion to the mean methodology, whereby short-term asset growth above or below the long-term annual rate assumption impacts the growth assumption applied to the five-year period subsequent to the current balance sheet date. The reversion to the mean methodology allows us to maintain our long-term growth assumptions, while also giving consideration to the effect of actual investment performance. When actual performance significantly deviates from the annual long-term growth assumption, as evidenced by growth assumptions for the five-year reversion to the mean period falling below a certain rate (floor) or above a certain rate (cap) for a sustained period, judgment may be applied to revise or “unlock” the growth rate assumptions to be used for both the five-year reversion to the mean period as well as the long-term annual growth assumption applied to subsequent periods. The use of a reversion to the mean assumption is common within the industry; however, the parameters used in the methodology are subject to judgment and vary within the industry. See Results of Operations - Life Insurance Companies DAC and Reserves - Reversion to the Mean for additional discussion.\n",

      "Impairments on Investments in Life Settlements\n",
      "Impairments to investments in life settlements may occur in the future due to the fact that continued payment of premiums required to maintain policies will cause the expected lifetime undiscounted cash flows for some policies to become negative in future reporting periods, even in the absence of future changes to the mortality assumptions. Impairments may also occur due to our future sale or lapse of select policies at a value that is below carrying amount.\n",

      "Goodwill Impairment\n",
      "For a discussion of goodwill impairment, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2015 and 2014, AIG elected to bypass the qualitative assessment of whether goodwill impairment may exist and, therefore, performed quantitative assessments that supported a conclusion that the fair value of all of the reporting units tested exceeded their book value. To determine fair value, we primarily use a discounted expected future cash flow analysis that estimates and discounts projected future distributable earnings. Such analysis is principally based on AIG’s business projections that inherently include judgments regarding business trends.\n",
      "Liability for Legal Contingencies\n",
      "We estimate and record a liability for potential losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent such losses are probable and can be estimated. Determining a reasonable estimate of the amount of such losses requires significant management judgment. In many cases, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases that are in the early stages of litigation or in which claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, we often cannot predict the outcome or estimate the eventual loss or range of reasonably possible losses related to such matters.\n",

Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment.\n",
      "We classify fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities as Level 3 when they require significant unobservable inputs in their valuation, including contractual terms, prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates, default rates, mortality rates and correlations of such inputs.\n",

These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses, and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios.\n",

You should read this Annual Report on Form 10-K in its entirety for a complete description of events, trends, uncertainties, risks and critical accounting estimates affecting us.\n",
      "In the fourth quarter of 2014, we completed our previously announced reorganization of our commercial and consumer insurance businesses and modified the presentation of our results to reflect our new operating structure. The new operating structure includes two reportable segments, Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance, and a Corporate and Other category. The Corporate and Other category consists of businesses and items not allocated to our reportable segments. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2014, we reported our results through two reportable segments - AIG Property Casualty and AIG Life and Retirement.\n",
      "In order to align financial reporting with the manner in which our chief operating decision makers review the businesses to assess performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated, the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance reportable segments include the following operating segments:\n",
      "• Commercial property casualty, mortgage guaranty and institutional markets businesses, which were previously reported as components of AIG Property Casualty, Other operations and AIG Life and Retirement, respectively, are now reported as components of the Commercial Insurance reportable segment.\n",
      "• Consumer property casualty business and Japan life insurance business, which were previously reported as components of AIG Property Casualty, and our retail life and retirement and institutional group retirement and group benefits businesses, which were previously reported as components of AIG Life and Retirement, are now reported as components of the Consumer Insurance reportable segment.\n",
      "• Insurance run-off lines of business, which were previously reported in AIG Property Casualty's Other category, are now reported as a component of the Corporate and Other category.\n",
      "Prior periods have been revised to conform to the current period presentation for the above segment changes.\n",
      "Presentation Changes\n",
      "We reclassified our presentation for certain Policy fees, along with a related portion of Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, from their respective captions to Net realized capital gains (losses) and Changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains (losses), respectively. The reclassification of these policy fees, which are related primarily to guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB) embedded derivatives in our variable annuity products, to realized capital gains (losses), consolidates the fees from these embedded derivatives with the associated change in fair value of such derivatives. The reclassifications reduced pre-tax operating income and after-tax operating income, but had no effect on GAAP basis Total revenues, Income from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit) or Net income.\n",
      "Also, revisions were made to change the classification of certain miscellaneous income from General operating and other expenses to premiums, and of certain broker-dealer fees from General operating and other expenses to other income, to conform with the current period presentation. There was no effect on pre-tax or after-tax operating income, income from continuing operations or net income.\n",

      "The reclassifications and revisions affected previously reported captions as follows:\n",
      "Executive Summary\n",
      "Financial Performance\n",
      "Commercial Insurance pre-tax operating income increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to improved underwriting results in the Property Casualty and Mortgage Guaranty operating segments partially offset by reduced net investment income in the Property Casualty and Institutional Markets operating segments.\n",
      "Consumer Insurance pre-tax operating income decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower net investment income, primarily from lower income from alternative investments, and additional reserves for IBNR death claims related to continued enhancement of claims procedures. These items more than offset favorable performance from our businesses in 2014 compared to 2013, which included growth in policy fees and assets under management primarily from strong sales of variable and index annuities in Retirement, effective crediting rate management, and higher underwriting income in Personal Insurance, primarily from improved loss experience and lower general operating expenses.\n",
      "Our investment portfolio performance improved in 2014 compared to 2013 due to positive performance on bonds for which we elected the fair value option, driven by movements on interest rates.\n",
      "Net realized capital gains declined in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower capital gains from sales of investments related to capital loss carryforward utilization and higher fair value losses on embedded derivatives related to variable annuity guarantee features, net of hedges.\n",

      "Investment Highlights\n",
      "Net investment income increased 1.7 percent to $16.1 billion in 2014 compared to 2013.\n",
      "Net investment income improved in 2014 compared to 2013 due to positive performance on bonds for which we elected the fair value option, driven by interest rate movements. While corporate debt securities represented the core of new investment allocations, we continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed income securities with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income.\n",
      "Net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio increased to approximately $19.0 billion as of December 31, 2014 from approximately $11.7 billion as of December 31, 2013 due to a decline in interest rates and widening of spreads.\n",
      "The overall credit rating of our fixed maturity securities portfolio remains largely unchanged from December 31, 2013.\n",
      "Liquidity and Capital Resources Highlights\n",
      "We reduced our debt in 2014 as a result of maturities, repayments and repurchases of $16.1 billion, of which $7.5 billion is related to DIB redemptions and repurchases.\n",
      "We maintained financial flexibility at AIG Parent in 2014 through $2.6 billion in dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our Non-Life Insurance Companies and $6.8 billion in dividends and loan repayments in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our Life Insurance Companies, which included approximately $829 million of legal settlement proceeds.\n",
      "Our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization of AIG Common Stock, par value $2.50 per share (AIG Common Stock), by an additional $2.5 billion on February 12, 2015. During 2014, we repurchased approximately 88 million shares of AIG Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4.9 billion. The total number of shares of AIG Common Stock repurchased in 2014, and the aggregate purchase price of these shares, reflect our payment of approximately $3.1 billion in the aggregate under five accelerated stock repurchase (ASR) agreements and our receipt of approximately 53 million shares of AIG Common Stock in the aggregate, including the initial receipt of 70 percent of the total notional share equivalent, or approximately 9.2 million shares of AIG Common Stock, under an ASR Agreement executed in December 2014.\n",
      "We paid a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $0.125 per share on each of March 25, 2014, June 24, 2014, September 25, 2014 and December 18, 2014.\n",
      "Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock on February 12, 2015 of $0.125 per share, payable on March 26, 2015 to shareholders of record on March 12, 2015.\n",
      "We received net cash proceeds of approximately $2.4 billion from the sale of ILFC after taking into account the settlement of intercompany loans. This cash amount is in addition to the 97.6 million newly issued AerCap common shares we received as consideration from the sale.\n",

      "Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n",
      "Strategic Outlook\n",
      "Industry Trends\n",
      "Our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit and equity market conditions, catastrophic claims events, regulation, tax policy, competition, and general economic, market and political conditions. We continued to operate under difficult market conditions in 2014, characterized by factors such as historically low interest rates, instability in the global markets and slowing growth in emerging markets, China and Euro-Zone economies.\n",
      "Interest rates remain low relative to historical levels, which has affected our industry by reducing investment returns. In addition, current market conditions may not necessarily permit insurance companies to increase pricing across all our product lines.\n",
      "Outlook for Our Operating Businesses\n",
      "The outlook for each of our businesses and management initiatives to improve growth and performance in 2015 and over the longer term is summarized below.\n",
      "Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n",
      "Commercial insurance Strategic initiatives and Outlook\n",
      "Market Conditions and Industry Trends\n",
      "Commercial Insurance expects the current low interest rate environment relative to historical levels, currency volatility, and ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions will continue to challenge the growth of net investment income and limit growth in some markets. Due to these conditions and overcapacity in the property casualty insurance industry, Commercial Insurance has sought to modify terms and conditions, grow profitable segments of the business, exit unprofitable businesses and develop advanced data analytics to improve profitability.\n",
      "Property Casualty\n",
      "Property Casualty has observed improving trends in certain key indicators that may offset the effect of current economic challenges. In recent years, Property Casualty has benefitted from favorable pricing trends, particularly in the U.S. However, such trends have tapered off in recent quarters. The property casualty insurance industry is experiencing modest growth as a result of this positive rate trend and an increase in overall exposures in certain markets. Property Casualty also expects that expansion in certain growth economies will occur at a faster pace than in developed countries, although at levels lower than those previously expected due to revised economic assumptions.\n",
      "Since the second quarter of 2014, within the U.S. commercial property business, Property Casualty observed continued rate pressure in the U.S. Excess and Surplus lines market, particularly with respect to its natural catastrophe exposed business. Property Casualty continues to differentiate its capacity from its peers through leveraging management’s significant experience with catastrophic events, providing loss prevention expertise and maintaining discipline in pricing to internal targets despite intense competition.\n",
      "In the U.S., Property Casualty’s exposure to terrorism risk is mitigated by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. For additional information on TRIA, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Reserves and Exposures and Item 7. MD&A - Enterprise Risk Management - Insurance Operations Risks - Non-Life Insurance Companies Key Insurance Risks - Terrorism Risk.\n",
      "Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n",
      "Mortgage Guaranty\n",
      "While higher residential mortgage interest rates have had an unfavorable impact on new mortgage loan volumes, particularly on refinancing activity, Mortgage Guaranty expects current residential mortgage interest rates will have a favorable impact on the persistency of business written in 2012 and 2013, since refinancing of mortgages would be unattractive to homeowners who originated mortgages at the historically low residential mortgage interest rates prevalent during that period. Mortgage Guaranty expects that this higher persistency will continue to have a positive effect on its results throughout 2015.\n",
      "Mortgage Guaranty also expects that newly reported delinquencies will decline during 2015. Mortgage Guaranty believes the combination of higher persistency and lower new delinquencies, partially offset by a decline in new mortgage loan volumes, will result in favorable operating results for 2015.\n",
      "Institutional Markets\n",
      "Institutional Markets is expected to continue growing its assets under management from increased stable value wrap business, as well as from disciplined growth through the pursuit of select opportunities related to pension buyouts and GICs.\n",
      "Strategic Initiatives\n",
      "Customer\n",
      "Commercial Insurance strives to be our customers’ most valued insurer. Our investments in engineering, underwriting, claims services, science and data together are intended to help offer our customers not only innovative products, superb service and access to an extensive global network but also a superior and rewarding customer experience.\n",
      "Strategic Growth\n",
      "Property Casualty’s efforts to better segment its business by industry, geography and type of coverage in order to enhance its decision making regarding risk acceptance and pricing are ongoing. For example, within workers’ compensation, Property Casualty has observed different experience and trends based on this segmentation, which helps inform its risk appetite, pricing and loss mitigation decisions.\n",
      "Mortgage Guaranty expects to continue as a leading provider of mortgage insurance and seeks to differentiate itself from its competitors by utilizing its proprietary risk-based pricing strategy. This pricing strategy provides Mortgage Guaranty’s customers with mortgage insurance products that are priced commensurate with the underwriting risk, which we believe will result in an appropriately priced, high-quality book of business.\n",
      "Institutional Markets is expected to continue contributing to growth in assets under management with stable value wraps and utilizing a disciplined approach to growth and diversification of our business by pursuing select opportunities in areas such as the pension buyout business.\n",
      "Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n",
      "Underwriting Excellence\n",
      "We continue to further enhance our risk selection process and refine technical pricing and producer management, through enhanced tools and analytics. In addition, we remain focused on managing exposure to capital intensive long-tail lines. We believe that accident year loss ratios, as adjusted, will continue to improve due to these actions.\n",
      "Claims Excellence\n",
      "We continue to reduce loss costs by realizing greater efficiencies in servicing customer claims, introducing improved claims analytics and services, developing knowledge of the economic drivers of losses which collectively are expected to mitigate reserve development and legal costs, and improve customer insights and pricing.\n",
      "Operational Effectiveness\n",
      "We continue to make strategic investments in systems, processes and talent worldwide, which are expected to create additional value and greater efficiency in the years ahead. In addition, along with other areas of AIG, Commercial Insurance continues to leverage its various off-shore centers, taking advantage of opportunities to centralize and standardize processes and platforms.\n",
      "Capital Efficiency\n",
      "Commercial Insurance continues to execute capital management initiatives by enhancing broad-based risk tolerance guidelines for its operating units, implementing underwriting strategies to increase return on equity by line of business and reducing exposure to businesses with inadequate pricing and increased loss trends. In addition, Commercial Insurance remains focused on enhancing its global reinsurance strategy to improve overall capital efficiency, although this strategy may lead to periodic income statement volatility.\n",
      "We also continue to streamline our legal entity structure to enhance transparency for regulators and optimize capital and tax efficiency, particularly with respect to the Non-Life Insurance Companies in the Property Casualty and Personal Insurance operating segments. Our legal entity restructuring initiatives have enhanced dividend capacity, reduced required capital, and provided tax benefits for these operations. Additionally, the restructurings allow us to simplify our reinsurance arrangements, which further facilitate increased capital optimization. In 2014, we completed the integration of our Japan operations into a holding company structure through the conversion of the American Home Assurance Company’s Japan branch to a subsidiary of the Japan holding company, American Home Assurance Japan, effective on April 1, 2014. We expect our overall legal entity restructuring to be substantially completed in 2016, subject to regulatory approvals in the relevant jurisdictions.\n",
      "Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n",
      "consumer insurance STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND Outlook\n",
      "Market Conditions and Industry Trends\n",
      "Retirement\n",
      "An increasing population of Americans expecting to live longer and placing less reliance on traditional retirement benefits are seeking financial security as they approach retirement, which continues to drive demand for individual variable and fixed index annuities with guaranteed income features. In addition, rising tax rates and a desire for higher investment returns have prompted less risk-averse investors to seek products without guaranteed lifetime income, providing Retirement Income Solutions the opportunity to further diversify its product portfolio by offering investment-focused variable annuities.\n",
      "The sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry. Low long-term interest rates put pressure on long-term investment returns, negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products. As long as the sustained low interest rate environment continues, market conditions will be challenging for the fixed annuity market. In addition, more highly leveraged providers have entered the market offering higher crediting rates.\n",
      "Despite the challenging environment where long-term interest rates have continued to remain low relative to historical levels throughout 2014, fixed annuity industry sales have continued to improve from the very low levels seen in 2013, as baby boomers approaching retirement continue to seek financial solutions that can provide guaranteed income, and customers are now more willing to purchase non-guaranteed return of premium products with market value adjustments in exchange for higher crediting rates. Although rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased surrenders, customers are currently buying fixed annuities with longer surrender periods in pursuit of higher returns.\n",
      "Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n",
      "Life\n",
      "Populations are living longer and have increased needs for financial protection for beneficiaries, estate planning and wealth creation. The Life operating segment addresses these needs with a broad spectrum of products, ranging from the pure protection focus of term life to investment-oriented products such as indexed and variable universal life.\n",
      "U.S. life insurance industry sales declined in 2014, driven by lower term and universal life sales partially offset by small gains in whole life markets. Market factors, primarily low interest rates and regulatory changes, have caused the universal life market to shift its focus from guaranteed universal life to indexed universal life products that offer attractive cash accumulation and increased living benefit options.\n",
      "Personal Insurance\n",
      "The overall rate level has improved in the Japanese and certain U.S. markets for auto, personal property, and accident and health products compared to prior years. In Japan, car and home sales increased in 2014 prior to the increase in the consumption tax, but prospectively, sales are expected to return to normal levels. In the U.S., overall rate level changes for auto and personal property products are expected to be positive but slow, with sales increasing as the economy continues to recover. Our Personal Insurance operating segment expects to increase its investment in growth economy nations that have a higher growth outlook for personal insurance products.\n",
      "Strategic Initiatives\n",
      "Customer\n",
      "We intend to expand relationships with key distribution partners to fully realize the benefits of our diverse product offerings across multiple channels. Our focus on ease of doing business for consumers and producers includes enhancements to our platforms and services, as well as initiatives to improve the recruitment, training and productivity of our affiliated and non-affiliated distribution partners.\n",
      "Information-driven Strategy\n",
      "We intend to continue to strengthen our direct marketing capabilities through the use of analytics, stronger platforms and tools, an enhanced product portfolio and expanded relationships allowing us to bring more product solutions to our target markets.\n",
      "We intend to achieve rate adequacy through implementation of global underwriting practices and enhanced tools and analytics. We intend to optimize the value of our business lines through product and portfolio management and refined technical pricing. We intend to continue to enhance the customer experience and efficiency through claim best practices, and to deploy enhanced operating structures and standardized processes and systems, while managing claim-handling efficiency.\n",
      "Focused Growth\n",
      "Retirement Income Solutions intends to continue capitalizing on the opportunity to meet consumer demand for guaranteed income by maintaining competitive variable annuity product offerings while managing risk, using innovative product design and well-developed economic hedging capabilities. De-risking features of its variable annuity product design include variable rider fees indexed to an equity market volatility index, required minimum allocations to fixed accounts, and the utilization of volatility control funds. Retirement Income Solutions has a dynamic risk management hedging program and continues to invest in market risk management. Strategies to diversify the Retirement Income Solutions product portfolio include growing sales of fixed index annuities with guarantee features, which provide additional income solutions for consumers approaching retirement, and introducing new investment-focused variable annuities, which offer alternative asset classes and tax benefits to investors seeking higher returns without guaranteed lifetime income.\n",
      "Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n",
      "Fixed Annuities sales will continue to be challenged by the low interest rate environment. Sales of fixed annuities could improve if interest rates rise and the yield curve steepens, as these market conditions make fixed annuity products more attractive compared to alternatives such as bank deposits. The growing market for immediate and deferred income products, driven by customers seeking guaranteed income products, provides an opportunity for Fixed Annuities to increase the diversification of its product portfolio.\n",
      "Life will continue to invest to position for growth and serve its customers more effectively, and maintain pricing discipline in its overall strategy. Internationally, Life intends to expand its business in Japan, the United Kingdom and certain other countries through a focused strategy in selected markets and products by combining global expertise with local market intelligence to meet the needs of consumers in these target markets.\n",
      "We acquired Ageas Protect Limited (Ageas Protect) on December 31, 2014 from international insurer Ageas Group for approximately $308 million. Our agreement to acquire Ageas Protect was announced in August 2014. Ageas Protect is a leading provider of life protection products in the United Kingdom, recognized in its market for product innovation, the effective use of technology and high quality service. We expect the acquisition of Ageas Protect to enhance our global Consumer Insurance business and strengthen our presence in the United Kingdom, where we already offer personal accident, health and travel insurance coverage, as well as customized insurance solutions for high net worth individuals through AIG Private Client Group.\n",
      "As part of our strategy to expand consumer operations in growth economies, on May 29, 2013, we entered into a joint venture agreement with PICC Life Insurance Company Limited (PICC Life), a subsidiary of the PICC Group, to form an agency distribution company in China to distribute life and retirement products. The joint venture company distributes PICC Life products and PICC Property & Casualty Company Limited (PICC P&C) insurance products, as well as other products aimed at meeting the needs of this developing market, and will distribute jointly developed life, retirement and personal insurance products. We own 24.9 percent of the joint venture company and PICC Life holds the remaining 75.1 percent. The joint venture commenced operations in March 2014.\n",
      "Consumer Insurance continues to explore other potential life insurance and accident and health opportunities internationally.\n",
      "Personal Insurance aims to provide customers with the products they need, distributed through the channels they prefer, and delivered with excellent customer service. Personal Insurance is focused on profitable growth in its selected market segments, with targeted investments in both scale businesses and emerging markets. Personal Insurance will continue to leverage its strong risk management and market expertise to foster growth by providing innovative and competitive solutions to its customers and distributors.\n",
      "Operational Effectiveness\n",
      "We are continuing to invest in initiatives to enable simpler and more agile low-cost operating models to provide superior service and position our operating platforms to accommodate significant future growth. In Japan, we continue to invest in technology and systems to improve operating efficiency and make it easier for our partners and our customers to do business with us, with the intent to ultimately increase our market share and facilitate our expansion in segments of the market that are expected to grow over the next decade, given demographic trends. In the U.S. Life business, we are focused on leveraging our most efficient systems environments and increased automation of our underwriting process. We believe that these simpler operating models will allow for productivity improvements and enhance our ability to leverage common functionality across product lines and borders, further supporting profitable growth.\n",
      "Investment Strategy\n",
      "Our investment objective is to maintain a diversified, high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities having weighted average durations that are matched to the duration and cash flow profile of our liabilities, to the extent practicable. Our investment strategy is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value, subject to liquidity requirements, capital constraints, diversification requirements, asset-liability matching and available investment opportunities. See Investments for additional discussion of investment strategies.\n",
      "Item 2 / EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n",
      "Profitability and Capital Management\n",
      "We intend to continue to enhance profitability and capital efficiency within our insurance entities through disciplined pricing, in-force profitability management and effective management of risk. Volatility risk controls including required minimum allocations to fixed and volatility control accounts, rider fees indexed to an equity market volatility index and our comprehensive dynamic hedging program are critical tools for products where we have significant equity market risk and exposure to changes in interest rates. Additionally, our scale and the breadth of our product offerings provide diversification of risk. Within our Non-Life Insurance Companies, we continue to streamline our legal entity structure to enhance transparency with regulators and optimize capital efficiency.\n",

      "The following table presents our consolidated results of operations:\n",
      "For the year ended December 31, 2014, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 27.9 percent. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits of $236 million associated with tax exempt interest income, $209 million related to a decrease in the U.S. Life Insurance Companies’ capital loss carryforward valuation allowance, $182 million of income excludable from gross income related to the global resolution of certain residential mortgage-related disputes and $68 million associated with the effect of foreign operations.\n",
      "For the year ended December 31, 2013, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 3.8 percent. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits of $2.8 billion related to a decrease in the U.S. Life Insurance Companies’ capital loss carryforward valuation allowance, $396 million related to a decrease in certain other valuation allowances associated with foreign jurisdictions and $298 million associated with tax exempt interest income. These items were partially offset by charges of $632 million related to uncertain tax positions.\n",
      "For the year ended December 31, 2012, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was (27.9) percent. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to decreases in the U.S. Life Insurance Companies’ capital loss carryforward valuation allowance of $1.9 billion related to the actual and projected gains from the U.S. Life Insurance Companies’ available-for-sale securities, and tax effects associated with tax exempt interest income of $302 million.

      "The following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to AIG to after-tax operating income attributable to AIG:\n",
      "After-tax operating income attributable to AIG for 2014 was essentially flat compared to 2013, primarily due to higher income tax expense, partially offset by an increase in income from insurance operations.\n",
      "After-tax operating income attributable to AIG increased in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to increases in income from insurance operations, lower income tax expense and noncontrolling interests, partially offset by fair value gains on AIG’s previously held interests in AIA ordinary shares, Maiden Lane II LLC (ML II), and ML III.\n",
      "For the year ended December 31, 2014, the effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income was 30.9 percent. The significant factors that contributed to the difference from the statutory rate included tax benefits resulting from tax exempt interest income and other permanent tax items, and the impact of discrete tax benefits.\n",
      "For the year ended December 31, 2013, the effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income was 28.8 percent.

      "Pre-tax Income Comparison for 2014 and 2013\n",
      "Pre-tax income increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in pre-tax operating income for Commercial Insurance, a $2.3 billion increase in income from divested businesses associated with the gain recognized upon completion of the sale of ILFC in 2014 and lower loss recognition expense reported in changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA, and SIA related to net realized capital gains. These increases were partially offset by higher loss on extinguishment of debt from on-going debt management activities, a decrease in net realized capital gains driven by lower gains from sales of investments related to capital loss carryforward utilization in 2013, and a decrease in legal settlements with financial institutions that participated in the creation, offering and sale of RMBS from which we realized losses during the financial crisis.\n",
      "The change in the fair value of GMWB and GMAV embedded policy derivatives, net of the change in fair value of all related economic hedges, resulted in a $149 million decrease in pre-tax income in 2014 compared to 2013. In 2014, we reduced our exposure to interest rate changes and consequently, the increase in the embedded policy derivative liability in 2014 was largely offset by the change in the fair value of related hedges. In 2013, pre-tax income increased due to the decrease in the embedded policy derivative liability driven by an increase in interest rates, which was only partially offset by hedging.

      "Pre-tax operating income increased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to decreases in underwriting loss, partially offset by a decrease in net investment income. The decrease in underwriting loss was primarily due to an increase in production, lower charges due to changes in discount for workers’ compensation reserves as discussed further under Insurance Reserves - Non-Life Insurance Companies- Discounting of Reserves, lower catastrophe losses and lower general operating expenses. The loss reserve discount charge decreased to $71 million in 2014 from $322 million in 2013. Catastrophe losses decreased to $602 million in 2014 from $710 million in 2013. These decreases were partially offset by higher adverse prior year loss reserve development in all lines of business except for Property, and an increase in current accident year losses reflecting higher frequency of non-severe losses in the Property and Specialty businesses. The current accident year losses for 2014 included 30 severe losses totaling $592 million compared to 27 severe losses totaling $569 million in the prior year.

      "Net investment income decreased in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to a decrease in interest rates during 2014, as yields on new purchases were lower than the weighted average yield of the overall portfolio, lower income on alternative investments, and lower income associated with investments accounted for under the fair value option, as the increase related to the PICC P&C rights offerings was more than offset by a decrease from fixed maturity investments accounted for under the fair value option. These were partially offset by the effect of continued portfolio diversification. Additionally, the decrease in allocated net investment income is also due to a reduction in net loss reserves.\n",

      "Pre-tax operating income increased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to a lower underwriting loss as a result of lower catastrophe losses, rate increases, enhanced risk selection and loss mitigation activities and an increase in net investment income. Catastrophe losses decreased to $710 million in 2013 from $2.3 billion in 2012. Partially offsetting these improvements was a loss reserve discount charge of $322 million in 2013, compared to a $100 million benefit in 2012. See Insurance Reserves- Non-Life Insurance Companies- Discounting of Reserves for further discussion. In addition, the current accident year losses for 2013 included severe losses of $569 million compared to $293 million in 2012. This increase was driven largely by a large property loss and related contingent business interruption claims, totaling $131 million in 2013 and by an increased frequency of severe losses in 2013 compared to 2012. Net adverse prior year loss reserve development increased by $30 million compared to 2012. Net adverse prior year loss reserve development, including related premium adjustments was $294 million in 2013, which included $149 million of adverse prior year loss reserve development related to Storm Sandy, compared to $236 million in 2012. The adverse prior year loss reserve development related to Storm Sandy resulted from higher severities on a small number of existing large and complex commercial claims. These increased severities were driven by a number of factors, including the extensive damage caused to properties in the downtown New York metropolitan area.\n",

Bad debt expense decreased by $159 million in 2013 from $140 million in 2012. The decrease in bad debt expense was primarily due to reductions in prior year reserves, as collections exceeded the originally estimated recoveries. Strategic initiatives which include technology-related expenses and those severance charges borne by Property Casualty, decreased by $137 million in 2013 from $277 million in 2012. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the cost of employee incentive plans primarily due to an improved alignment of employee performance with the overall performance of the organization, including our stock performance, and accelerated vesting provisions for retirement-eligible individuals in the 2013 share-based plan.\n",

This alternative investment performance was primarily due to our investments in hedge funds, which benefited from equity market performance. Fair value increases also contributed to the net investment income increase. The portion of our investment in PICC P&C shares accounted for under the fair value option contributed $110 million to net investment income. Although interest rates remained at historically low levels, there were upward movements in rates throughout the year, with the ten year U.S. Treasury yield increasing 126 basis points during 2013.

Retirement has an active product management process to ensure that new business offerings appropriately reflect the current interest rate environment. To the extent that Retirement cannot achieve targeted net investment spreads on new business, products are re-priced or no longer sold. Additionally, where appropriate, existing products that had higher minimum rate guarantees have been re-filed with lower crediting rates as permitted under state insurance laws for new sales.

In addition to deferred annuity products, certain traditional long-duration products for which Retirement does not have the ability to adjust interest rates, such as payout annuities, are exposed to reduced earnings and potential loss recognition reserve increases in a sustained low interest rate environment.

The increase in Fixed Annuities deposits in 2013 compared to 2012 was due to the increase in market interest rates in the second half of 2013.

The improvement in the surrender rate (see Surrender Rates below) was primarily due to the significant growth in account value driven by the high volume of sales, which has increased the proportion of business that is within the surrender charge period.\n",
      "Retail Mutual Fund deposits and net flows decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 and increased in 2013 compared to 2012.

The large group market has become increasingly competitive and has been impacted by the consolidation of healthcare providers and other employers in our target markets. This trend of heightened competition is expected to continue in 2015 as plan sponsors perform reviews of existing retirement plan relationships.

The 2014 increase in the IBNR reserve was related primarily to a legacy block of in-force and lapsed small face amount policies, for which the personal data elements to effect a match against the Social Security Death Master File are unavailable or incomplete, such as full legal name, date of birth or Social Security number. In 2014, in the process of reviewing these policies as required under the terms of the regulatory agreement, we have refined our estimate of the ultimate cost of these claims.

      "Personal Insurance net premiums written decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange as the U.S. dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, net premiums written increased in 2014 compared to 2013 as the business continued to grow through multiple product and distribution channels, including direct marketing.\n",
      "A&H net premiums written decreased in 2014 compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to our focus on maintaining underwriting discipline in certain classes of business in the U.S., partially offset by growth in Japan and Latin America.\n",
      "Personal Lines net premiums written, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to increased rates and improved retention in AIG Private Client Group and continued growth of automobile business outside of Japan, partially offset by declines in the U.S. warranty service programs.\n",

      "A&H net premiums written, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased slightly in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to our focused strategy to grow sales through the direct marketing distribution channel, individual A&H in Asia Pacific, and the travel business which continued to increase in most geographies across the globe.\n",
      "Personal Lines net premiums written, excluding the effects of foreign exchange, increased in 2013 compared to 2012. The increases were driven by growth in AIG Private Client Group and the warranty service programs, automobile products and the continued execution of our strategic initiative to grow higher value lines of business. In addition, the impact of excess of loss ceded premiums and of the catastrophe bond issuances reduced net premiums written by $58 million compared to 2012.\n",

This discounting-related charge was partially offset by a $98 million decrease in net adverse prior year loss reserve development and an improvement in current accident year loss experience, particularly in the environmental liability business (2004 and prior). The discount charge was primarily due to the decline in risk free rates during 2014 used under Pennsylvania and Delaware prescribed or permitted practices, change in payout pattern assumptions, including the effect of commutations and accelerated settlements for the certain Excess Workers’ Compensation reserves, as well as accretion. See Insurance Reserves - Discounting of Reserves for additional information.\n",

      "Investments\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "Our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. The investment objectives are driven by the respective business models for Non-Life Insurance Companies, Life Insurance Companies, and AIG Parent including the DIB. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products. The majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities.\n",
      "Investment Strategies\n",
      "Investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local and general market conditions, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification.\n",
      "Some of our key investment strategies are as follows:\n",
      "• Fixed maturity securities held by the U.S. insurance companies included in Non-Life Insurance Companies consist of a mix of instruments that meet our current risk-return, tax, liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectives.\n",
      "• Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by Non-Life Insurance Companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.\n",
      "• While more of a focus is placed on asset-liability matching in Life Insurance Companies, our fundamental strategy across all of our investment portfolios is to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with assets of comparable duration, to the extent practicable.\n",
      "• AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, intermediate term investment-\n",
      "Item 7 / INVESTMENTS\n",
      "grade rated fixed maturity securities. Based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchases publicly traded, intermediate term, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity.\n",
      "Investments by Legal Entity\n",
      "The following tables summarize the composition of AIG's investments by legal entity:\n",
      "* At December 31, 2014, approximately 90 percent and 10 percent of investments were held by domestic and foreign entities, respectively, compared to approximately 89 percent and 11 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2013.\n",
      "The following table presents the components of Net Investment Income:\n",
      "* Includes changes in fair value of certain fixed maturity securities where the fair value option has been elected and which are used to economically hedge the interest rate risk in GMWB embedded derivatives. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the net investment income (loss) recorded on these securities was $260 million, $(161) million and $37 million, respectively.\n",
      "Net investment income for 2014 increased compared to 2013 primarily due to positive performance on bonds where we elected the fair value option, driven by movements in interest rates, partially offset by lower income on alternative investments\n",
      "Item 7 / INVESTMENTS\n",
      "due to equity market performance and lower reinvestment yields on our fixed maturity securities portfolio due to the low interest rate environment.\n",
      "Net investment income for 2013 decreased compared to 2012 primarily due to fair value gains from our investments in ML II, ML III and AIA prior to their sale in 2012.\n",
      "Non-Life Insurance Companies\n",
      "For the Non-Life Insurance Companies, the duration of liabilities for long-tail casualty lines is greater than that of other lines. As a result, the investment strategy within the Non-Life Insurance Companies focuses on growth of surplus and preservation of capital, subject to liability and other business considerations.\n",
      "The Non-Life Insurance Companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies and also invest in structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans. While invested assets backing reserves of the Non-Life Insurance Companies are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities, we have continued to allocate a portion of our investment activity into asset classes that offer higher yields, particularly in the domestic operations. In addition, we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate investments for their risk-return attributes, as well as to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates. This asset diversification has maintained stable average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity securities were largely unchanged. We expect to continue to pursue this investment strategy to meet the Non-Life Insurance Companies’ liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk-return and tax objectives.\n",
      "In addition, the Non-Life Insurance Companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of private equity funds and hedge funds. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio. The Non-Life Insurance Companies’ investment portfolio also includes, to a lesser extent, equity securities and other yield-enhancing investments.\n",
      "With respect to non-affiliate over-the-counter derivatives, the Non-Life Insurance Companies conduct business with highly rated counterparties and do not expect the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations under the contracts. The Non-Life Insurance Companies have controls in place to monitor credit exposures by limiting transactions with specific counterparties within specified dollar limits and assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties periodically. The Non-Life Insurance Companies generally use ISDA Master Agreements and CSAs with bilateral collateral provisions to reduce counterparty credit exposures.\n",
      "Fixed maturity investments of the Non-Life Insurance Companies domestic operations, with an average duration of 4.3 years, are currently comprised primarily of tax-exempt securities, which provide attractive risk-adjusted after-tax returns, as well as taxable municipal bonds, government and agency bonds, and corporate bonds. The majority of these high quality investments are rated A or higher based on composite ratings.\n",
      "Fixed maturity investments held in the Non-Life Insurance Companies foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated A or higher based on composite ratings, and short to intermediate duration, averaging 3.3 years.\n",
      "Life Insurance Companies\n",
      "The investment strategy of the Life Insurance Companies is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value, subject to liquidity requirements, capital constraints, diversification requirements, asset-liability matching and available investment opportunities.\n",
      "The Life Insurance Companies use asset-liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses. The Life Insurance Companies fundamental investment strategy is to maintain a diversified, high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities with the intent to largely match the characteristics of liabilities, including duration, which is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific\n",
      "Item 7 / INVESTMENTS\n",
      "characteristics of its insurance liabilities, and as a result, certain portfolios are shorter in duration and others are longer in duration. An extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses.\n",
      "The Life Insurance Companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans.\n",
      "In addition, the Life Insurance Companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields. The Life Insurance Companies investment portfolio also includes, to a lesser extent, equity securities and yield enhancing items.\n",
      "The Life Insurance Companies monitor fixed income markets, including the level of interest rates, credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve. The Life Insurance Companies frequently review their interest rate assumptions and actively manages the crediting rates used for their new and in-force business. Business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a historically low interest rate environment. The low interest rate environment makes it more difficult to profitably price attractive guaranteed return products and puts margin pressure on existing products, due to the challenge of investing recurring premiums and deposits and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows in the low rate environment while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity. In addition, there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain in-force business. Specifically, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities.\n",
      "Fixed maturity investments of the Life Insurance Companies domestic operations, with an average duration of 6.62 years, are comprised of taxable corporate bonds, as well as taxable municipal and government bonds, and agency and non-agency structured securities. The majority of these investments are held in the available for sale portfolio and are rated investment grade based on its composite ratings.\n",
      "Fixed maturity investments held in the Life Insurance Companies foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated A or higher based on composite ratings, and intermediate duration, averaging 12.68 years.\n",
      "NAIC Designations of Fixed Maturity Securities\n",
      "The Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the NAIC evaluates the investments of U.S. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called ‘NAIC Designations.’ In general, NAIC Designations of ‘1’ highest quality, or ‘2’ high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while NAIC Designations of ‘3’ through ‘6’ generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade. The NAIC has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities, including non-agency RMBS and CMBS, which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses to better determine the appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities. These methodologies result in an improved NAIC Designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. The following tables summarize the ratings distribution of Life Insurance Companies fixed maturity security portfolio by NAIC Designation, and the distribution by composite AIG credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies. See Investments - Credit Ratings herein for a full description of the composite AIG credit ratings.\n",

      "The following table presents the fixed maturity security portfolio of Life Insurance Companies categorized by NAIC Designation, at fair value:\n",

      "Credit Ratings\n",
      "At December 31, 2014, approximately 90 percent of our fixed maturity securities were held by our domestic entities. Approximately 17 percent of such securities were rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies, and approximately 17 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated. Our investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings. Third-party rating services’ ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis.\n",
      "A significant portion of our foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio is rated by Moody’s Investors’ Service Inc. (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (S&P), or similar foreign rating services. Rating services are not available for some foreign-issued securities. Our Credit Risk Management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio’s non-rated fixed maturity securities. At December 31, 2014, approximately 17 percent of such investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of our internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated AAA, and approximately five percent were below investment grade or not rated. Approximately 44 percent of the foreign entities’ fixed maturity securities portfolio is comprised of sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance.\n",
      "Composite AIG Credit Ratings\n",
      "With respect to our fixed maturity investments, the credit ratings in the table below and in subsequent tables reflect: (a) a composite of the ratings of the three major rating agencies, or when agency ratings are not available, the rating assigned by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Securities Valuations Office (SVO) (over 99 percent of total fixed maturity investments), or (b) our equivalent internal ratings when these investments have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies or the NAIC.

New York rules generally do not permit non-tabular discounting on IBNR and prescribe a fixed 5 percent discount rate for application to case reserves. Pennsylvania permits non-tabular discounting of IBNR and, commencing in 2013, approved a variable discount rate determined using risk-free rates based on the U.S. Treasury forward yield curve plus a liquidity margin, applicable to IBNR and case reserves. Delaware has permitted discounting on the same basis as the Pennsylvania domiciled companies.\n",
      "The net reduction in workers’ compensation discount in 2014 of $456 million is primarily due to the decline in risk-free rates during 2014 used under Pennsylvania and Delaware prescribed or permitted practices, changes in the payout pattern assumptions, including the effect of commutations and accelerated settlements for certain excess workers’ compensation reserves, as well as accretion. The change in rates used for discounting was the largest driver of the charge as Treasury rates fell along the entire payout pattern horizon during 2014, and accounted for $397 million of the decrease. The accelerated settlements and commutations in the excess workers’ compensation class of business during 2014 accounted for approximately $111 million of the decrease. The effects of these changes were somewhat offset by increased discount from newly established reserves for accident year 2014 and the impact of the first quarter re-pooling described below.\n",
      "On January 1, 2014, the Non-Life Insurance Companies merged their two internal pooling arrangements into one pool, and changed the participation percentages of the pool members, resulting in a reallocation of reserves from New York domiciled companies to those domiciled in Pennsylvania and Delaware. As a result of these changes in the participation percentages and domiciliary states of the participants of the combined pool, the Non-Life Insurance Companies recognized a discount benefit of $110 million in the first quarter of 2014.\n",

      "AIG net loss reserves represent our best estimate of the liability for net losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2014. While we regularly review the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that our ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely in future years and materially exceed our loss reserves as of December 31, 2014. In our opinion, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, although such events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.\n",

      "Net Loss Development\n",
      "In determining the loss development from prior accident years, AIG analyzes and evaluates the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year by class of business. For example, if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years, we examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business. In some cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question, and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years. In other cases, the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a large change, either favorable or unfavorable. As appropriate, we make adjustments for the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence for each accident year. As part of our reserving process, we also consider notices of claims received with respect to emerging and/or evolving issues.\n",
      "In 2014, the adverse prior year loss reserve development, including premium adjustments of $105 million, was $598 million, which was driven by reserve increases on claims in Commercial Insurance and Other - U.S. The net adverse prior year loss reserve development in Commercial Insurance was driven by Primary Casualty, Environmental, International Financial Lines and Healthcare, partially offset by Natural catastrophes, International Primary Casualty and International Commercial Property, while the adverse development in Other - U.S. was driven by adverse development on legacy asbestos and pollution exposures (1986 and prior) and run-off environmental exposures (1987 - 2004). The U.S. Primary Casualty adverse prior year loss reserve development of $445 million was driven by primary General Liability ($182 million), primary Auto Liability ($156 million) and primary Workers’ Compensation ($137 million) due to worse than expected emergence and updated loss development and expected loss ratio assumptions.\n",
      "During 2013, the adverse prior year loss reserve development including premium adjustments was $468 million. The increase was primarily due to the increases in reserves by $108 million for Storm Sandy, $219 million for U.S. construction primary general liability lines and $238 million for the run-off environmental (1987 to 2004) book.\n",
      "In addition, we recognized additional premiums on loss sensitive business of $105 million, $89 million and $54 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which entirely offset adverse development in that business.\n",
      "For the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred reinsurance reinstatement premiums of ($2) million, compared to $27 million for 2013 and $0 for 2012.\n",
      "The following is a discussion of the primary reasons for the development in 2014, 2013 and 2012 of those classes of business that experienced significant prior accident year development during the three-year period. See MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates for a description of our loss reserving process.\n",
      "Excess Casualty - U.S.\n",
      "The excess casualty class presents unique challenges for estimating the unpaid losses. Insureds are generally required to provide notice of claims that exceed a threshold, either expressed as a proportion of the attachment (e.g., 50 percent of the attachment) or for particular types of claims (e.g., death, quadriplegia). This threshold is generally established well below our attachment point, to provide us with a precautionary notice of claims that could potentially pierce our layer of coverage. This means that the majority of claims close without payment because the claims never pierce our layer, while the claims that close with payment can be large and highly variable. Thus, estimates of unpaid losses carry significant uncertainty. For reserve reporting purposes, we combine the Umbrella Excess casualty business with the high layer Catastrophic Casualty business that attaches when losses exceed $50 million.\n",
      "During 2014, Excess Casualty experienced $36 million of favorable development largely driven by savings on a few large claims. In our Excess Umbrella analysis in 2014, our revised segmentation led to lower 2005 and subsequent accident year estimates for non-mass tort claims where we expect underwriting actions and reductions in policy limits to have a favorable effect on ultimate losses from accident years 2007 to 2013 in particular. This was entirely offset by higher selected ultimate losses for accident years 2004 and prior as a result of updated loss development patterns for mass tort claims which we segmented separately from the non-mass tort claims.\n",
      "During 2013, Excess Casualty experienced $144 million of favorable emergence due to favorable outcomes on some large cases from 2010 and lower than expected emergence in high layer Catastrophic Casualty business.\n",
      "Item 7 / insurance reserves / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES\n",
      "During 2012, the Excess Casualty class of business experienced $157 million of adverse development based on worse than expected Umbrella Excess emergence, primarily from adverse outcomes relating to certain large claims from older accident years, from the legacy public entity excess casualty class of business and from a refined analysis applied to claims in excess of $10 million. This refined analysis considered the impact of changing attachment points (primarily impacting frequency of excess claims) and limit structures (primarily impacting severity of excess claims) throughout the loss development period.\n",
      "Environmental and Pollution Products\n",
      "We maintain an active environmental insurance business related to pollution legal liability and general liability for environmental consultants and engineers, as well as run-off business for certain environmental coverage which provides cost overrun protection, in some cases over long time periods. We evaluate and report reserves associated with this business separately from the 1986 and prior asbestos and environmental reserves associated with standard General Liability and Umbrella policies discussed under “Asbestos and Environmental Reserves”.\n",
      "Historically, we had used traditional actuarial methods to assess the reserves for pollution products. The comprehensive claims review process that began in 2012 provided a more refined approach for the development of actuarial estimates for toxic tort claims (which were found to have a distinctly lengthier loss development pattern than other general liability claims in the environmental portfolio) as well as a more appropriate methodology for incorporating case reserving based estimates of ultimate loss costs for complex claims involving environmental remediation and/or from policies with high policy limits (greater than $5 million per policy). Notwithstanding the refined methodology and approach applied in 2012 and subsequently, considerable uncertainty remains over the ultimate loss costs for this class of business, especially for business written in accident years 2003 and prior.\n",
      "In 2014, our updated analysis of environmental and pollution products resulted in adverse prior year loss reserve development of $120 million for pollution policies primarily written prior to 2004, which are managed by our run-off unit, and $91 million for pollution policies written 2004 and subsequent. The prior year loss reserve development on policies written prior to 2004 is mostly due to projected increases for individual claim estimates as determined by our run-off unit. The prior year loss reserve development on policies written in 2004 and subsequent is due to an increase in the pure IBNR by reflecting an increase in the estimated future severity for the pure IBNR claims and an increase in the expected loss ratios for recent years to reflect the emerging experience and the results of updated claim file reviews completed in 2014. Our updated reviews did not establish any discernible trends from a policy structure, industry class, or cause of loss standpoint. Rather, there were several large loss increases associated with a single accident or catastrophe. While the average policy term for new business written is close to three years, the results for more recent accident years can still be influenced by longer term policies issued in prior years. We have continued to actively monitor and adjust policy terms offered in the pollution products class of business. Transactions with policy terms greater than five years have been reduced by more than 75 percent, with policy terms in excess of five years now accounting for just four percent of the gross written premiums of the book. The new business written continues to meet risk adjusted profitability targets after the increased estimates of ultimate losses for the more recent accident years.\n",
      "In 2013, our analysis of pollution products reflected an updated review of individual cases which indicated large increases in the value of certain previously reported cases due to new developments such as the discovery of additional contamination in certain sites, legislative changes, and court rulings, expansion of plaintiff damages and increased cost of remediation technologies. Additionally, the number and severity of newly reported claims was higher than expected. As a result, we increased our estimate of ultimate losses by approximately $269 million with approximately $201 million of this relating to policies written in 2003 and prior. Significant changes in underwriting during 2004 changed the terms and conditions materially for policies written after 2003 to reduce our exposure to these events.\n",
      "Because of an increase in the frequency and severity of claims observed beginning in 2011, the 2012 loss reserve review consisted of an intensive review of reported claims by a multi-disciplinary team including external specialists in environmental law and engineering science, toxicologists and other specialists, our actuaries, claims managers and underwriters to reassess our indicated loss reserve need. The review improved our understanding of factors that drive claim costs such as policy term, limit, pollution conditions covered, location of incident and applicable laws and remediation standards. The analysis used these factors to segment and analyze the claim data to determine ultimate costs, in some cases, on a claim by claim basis. As a result of this analysis, $200 million of adverse prior year loss reserve development was recognized during 2012, including $166 million for pollution products reported in the run-off unit. The majority (81 percent) of the adverse development related to accident years 2003 and prior, before significant underwriting changes were adopted.\n",
      "Item 7 / insurance reserves / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES\n",
      "In addition to reserving actions, we have made significant changes to the ongoing environmental business included in Commercial Insurance with the goal of ensuring that the current policies are being written to earn an appropriate risk adjusted profit. Underwriting guidelines have been revised to no longer cover known or expected clean up costs, which were a significant driver of historical claims, and a “new emerging contaminants” team has been formed within the dedicated environmental engineering staff to track any new cleanup standards that may be set by federal or state regulators. Further, engineering reviews are required for specific business segments (such as oil and gas, and landfills) that have traditionally generated higher losses.\n",
      "Primary Casualty - U.S. and Canada\n",
      "Primary Casualty includes Workers’ Compensation, General Liability and Auto Liability lines of business. In addition, these lines of business are categorized into classes of business including National Accounts, Commercial Risk, Specialty Workers’ Compensation, Energy, Multi National, Construction, Transportation and Trucking.\n",
      "The National Accounts class of business includes casualty insurance for businesses with revenues of $700 million or more. The Commercial Risk class of business includes casualty insurance for businesses with revenues of less than $700 million. The majority of the business is workers’ compensation. The Specialty Workers’ Compensation class of business includes small monoline guaranteed cost risks. Our Specialty Workers’ Compensation class of business grew significantly in the early to mid 2000s but has reduced premium writings by nearly 70 percent since 2007. The Energy class of business includes casualty insurance (including workers’ compensation) in the mining, oil and gas and power generation sectors. The Construction, Transportation and Trucking class of business includes casualty insurance (including workers’ compensation) within that industry.\n",
      "During 2014, we continued to refine our segmentation of primary workers’ compensation into guaranteed cost and excess of large deductible business by deductible size group. The net result of the analysis was adverse development of $137 million for the primary workers’ compensation class of business. The key drivers of the adverse development in this class of business were increases for guaranteed cost business in California and New York, and increases for excess of large deductible business, as well as adverse experience in the Construction class. Each of these segments appears to have been impacted by specific structural changes in the portfolio. For California business, our tail factor increases were in response to changing long-term medical development patterns. In New York, there has been a lengthening of the period between the date of accident and the classification of non-scheduled permanent partial injuries. We completed a review of claim emergence and payouts for our top six states in workers’ compensation and concluded that California and New York were the main states where the loss development patterns had materially changed since our last review. For excess of large deductible business across all states, we updated our analyses to consider the impact of changes in the mix of retentions that has occurred over time as the data by retention band was becoming more credible. For the Construction class, we note that the construction sector has experienced a comparatively slow recovery in payroll employment. As a result of the diminished employment opportunities in this industry sector, injured workers may experience limited return-to-work opportunities, which moderate the shortening of claim duration that normally accompanies a labor market recovery. For all other states combined excluding California and New York, we saw favorable emergence in our middle market Specialty Workers’ Compensation segment. The net effect of these revised selections had the greatest adverse effect on the Construction class of business ($140 million adverse development) and the National Accounts class of business ($125 million adverse development). The most significant favorable effect was in the Specialty Workers’ Compensation class of business ($155 million favorable development). Our analysis considers our best estimate expectations of medical inflation and loss costs trends and also reflects the impacts of enhancements in our claim management and loss mitigation activities, such as opioid management, fraud investigation and medical management.\n",
      "For primary general liability in 2014, we increased our ultimate losses for prior years by $182 million. This was largely driven by the construction segment as a result of several large construction defect claims and increases in the costs of claims in New York associated with New York Labor Law. The construction results in California and New York continue to be the main sources of adverse development in our guaranteed cost primary general liability books although we did experience adverse development from construction defect claims in other states in 2014. Our large account primary non-construction general liability business was adversely impacted by claim activity in the layers excess of large insured retentions and we increased our loss development patterns for these layers to reflect the changes.\n",
      "For commercial auto in 2014, we reacted to an increase in frequency of large claims in the accident years 2010 to 2013, where the economic recovery has contributed to increased frequency and severity, especially for those claims in excess of a client\n",
      "Item 7 / insurance reserves / NON-LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES\n",
      "deductible of $500,000, which generally take several years to emerge and settle. This led to adverse prior year loss reserve development of $156 million for the automobile subset of primary casualty.\n",
      "During 2013, we continued to refine the segmentation of our analyses of primary workers’ compensation, which indicated that prior year loss reserve development was flat after taking into account the initiatives that our claim function has undertaken to manage high risk claims.\n",
      "During 2013, for primary general liability, we increased our reserves for prior years by approximately $355 million. Most of the increase was driven by construction-related primary general liability claims, especially construction defect claims where we increased our ultimate loss estimates by $219 million to reflect the higher than expected frequency and severity of these claims especially in states that experienced heavy increases in construction activity after the 2004 and 2005 hurricanes and during the housing boom prior to 2007. Due to the subsequent home price declines observed in many of these states, the frequency of reported losses has increased as the losses subsequently represented a larger percentage of the equity values of the affected homes, and homeowners increasingly looked to insurance recoveries as a way to recoup some of that lost value.\n",
      "During 2012, we significantly intensified our claims management efforts for those primary workers’ compensation claims which are managed by AIG. These efforts include consulting with various specialists, including clinical and public health professionals and other advisors. We also continued to refine our actuarial methodologies for estimating ultimate loss costs incorporating a more refined segmentation by state (California and New York were analyzed separately) and a more refined approach for business subject to deductibles as well as business subject to premium adjustments (loss-sensitive business). Based on these enhanced reviews, we increased reserves by $46 million.\n",
      "In 2012, we also reviewed the general liability loss experience of the primary casualty classes of business using a more refined segmentation for business subject to a deductible as well as loss-sensitive business. Our review focused on applying actuarial loss development analyses to those general liability claims for which these techniques are appropriate. As a result of this analysis, we determined that prior year reserves needed to be increased by $235 million for the primary general liability class of business in 2012 to reflect the worse than expected emergence of paid loss severities for both bodily injury and property damage claims from the more recent accident years (2008 and subsequent).\n",
      "Healthcare\n",
      "During 2014, we recognized $109 million of adverse development in this class largely driven by three large and relatively unusual claims of $25 million each in relatively recent accident years. While there have not been any significant structural changes to the portfolio, there can be material volatility in loss experience in this class of business where individual claims can be of high severity.\n",
      "During 2013, this class recognized $54 million of favorable prior year development due to lower than expected loss emergence in many classes such as Excess Hospital Liability.\n",
      "During 2012, this class recognized $68 million of adverse prior year loss reserve development due to several large claims that involved unusual coverage issues for this class. With the exception of these claims, this class experienced claim activity in line with expectations.\n",
      "Financial Lines - U.S. and Canada\n",
      "Financial Lines business includes Director and Officer (D&O) and Related Management Liability, including various Professional Liability classes of business as well as the Fidelity book of business. The Financial Lines book consists mostly of the D&O class of business.\n",
      "During 2014, we recognized $47 million of favorable development driven by the Professional Liability and D&O and Related Management Liability classes of business, somewhat offset by adverse development on the Fidelity book in recent accident years due to the changing economic cycle.\n",
      "During 2013, we recognized $113 million of favorable development driven somewhat evenly among the Professional Liability, Fidelity and D&O and Related Management Liability classes of business.

      "During 2012, we recognized $283 million of favorable development in these classes of business largely driven by the D&O and Related Management Liability classes of business. For the year-end 2012 loss reserve review, our actuaries took into account the favorable emergence during 2012 for several accident years, especially accident year 2010, the claims department’s reviews of open claims and reduced the ultimate losses for prior accident years accordingly. The 2012 D&O and Related Management Liability actuarial review also used a refined segmentation for this class of business with the selection of differentiated frequency and severity trends. The overall loss cost used for this class of business in 2012 from the application of the refined segmentation was slightly lower than that adopted for the 2011 review reflecting the continued favorable emergence from the class of business\n",
      "Financial Lines - International\n",
      "Our Global Financial Lines Claims unit has implemented its target operating model in Europe and Australasia which has provided our actuaries with more detailed case reserve data and analysis, enabling AIG’s actuaries to react sooner to case development than in prior reserve studies. The actuaries see evidence of earlier settlement of claims on a paid and incurred basis in the International Financial Lines class of business. During 2014, we recognized $182 million of adverse development in the international Financial Lines segments, driven by large claims emergence in the U.K., Australasia and Europe. Multiple accident years contributed to this total, but it was concentrated most heavily in accident years 2008-2011. The Australasia emergence was due to a number of specific large losses in the Australia and New Zealand D&O business. In Europe, adverse prior year loss reserve development was concentrated in the D&O class of business, where we have observed a greater incidence of severe claims compared with prior years, and the Professional class of business, with large losses from one insured. The new business written across International Financial Lines continues to meet risk adjusted profitability targets after the increased estimates of ultimate losses for the more recent accident years.\n",
      "During 2013, we recognized $74 million of adverse development, all of which stemmed from losses in the D&O books in Europe, UK and Australasia, with the other segments showing modest favorable development. The development we recognized can be directly linked to a small number of specific claims booked throughout the year.\n",
      "During 2012, we recognized $33 million of adverse development, concentrated in Europe and Australasia D&O, which was related to a small number of specific severe claims in those regions.\n",
      "Excess Workers’ Compensation - U.S.\n",
      "This class of business, which is reported in our run-off unit, has an extremely long tail and is one of the most challenging classes of business to reserve for, particularly when the excess coverage is provided above a self-insured retention layer. The class is highly sensitive to small changes in assumptions - in the rate of medical inflation or the longevity of injured workers, for example - which can have a significant effect on the ultimate reserve estimate.\n",
      "During 2014, we updated our analyses of Excess Workers compensation using a range of scenarios and methodologies and determined that our carried reserves were adequate after recognizing $20 million of favorable prior year development as a result of claim settlements and commutations of assumed reinsurance business, as well as reflecting changes in estimates in our loss mitigation strategies. We commuted several large assumed reinsurance agreements in 2014 and reduced the reserves faster than was previously expected as a result of our proactive management by the run-off unit. The reduction in nominal reserves as a result of assumed reinsurance commutations and individual claims settlement strategies amounted to $242 million in 2014, compared to $25 million in 2013. The results from these strategies also impacted the loss payout patterns used in our discount calculations, previously discussed.\n",
      "During 2013, we updated our analysis of Excess Workers’ Compensation reserves and determined that no changes to our carried reserves were needed. We also updated our analysis of underlying claims cost drivers used in 2012 through accident year 2004, discussed in more detail below.\n",
      "During the 2012 loss reserve review, we augmented traditional reserve methodologies with an analysis of underlying claims cost drivers to inform our judgment of the ultimate loss costs for open reported claims from accident years 2003 and prior\n",

      "This approach was deemed to be most suitable for injured workers whose medical conditions had largely stabilized (i.e., at least 9 to 10 years have elapsed since the date of injury). The reserves for accident years 2004 and subsequent (13 percent of total case and IBNR reserves for this class) were determined using traditional methods.\n",

      "During 2014, we experienced favorable property catastrophe prior year development of $102 million in our U.S. and Canada business, primarily due to several U.S. events in accident year 2013. We also experienced favorable property catastrophe prior year loss reserve development of $77 million from our international property class of business.\n",
      "During 2013, we experienced adverse development from Storm Sandy totaling $108 million, or 5.4 percent of the 2012 estimate. This development resulted from higher severities on a small number of large and complex commercial claims driven by a number of factors including the extensive damage caused to properties in the downtown New York metropolitan area.\n",
      "During 2012, we experienced favorable development from the Tohoku Catastrophe in Japan due to commercial claim severities being less than previously reserved.\n",
      "International Casualty\n",
      "During 2014, 2013 and 2012, we had $67 million, $40 million, and $46 million of favorable development, respectively. The favorable development in each year is due to lower than expected loss emergence in many classes and countries outside the U.S., with the majority from various countries in the EMEA region.\n",
      "Personal Insurance\n",
      "During 2014, we experienced favorable loss reserve development of $16 million from Natural Catastrophes, primarily related to Storm Sandy. The remaining $61 million of favorable development is primarily from Homeowners, International Accident & Health and U.S. Warranty.\n",

      "During 2014, we recognized $104 million of favorable prior year loss reserve development driven in part by steady increases in year-over-year first lien cure rates, a reflection of the improved economic environment, and in part by favorable frequency trends and recoveries in second lien claims. Partially offsetting these improvements were upward trends in severity, particularly for older (pre-2012) accident periods.\n",
      "During 2013, we recognized $30 million of adverse prior year loss reserve development due to unfavorable emergence of overturns of prior claim cancellations and increased severity estimates in first liens, partially offset by favorable frequency in student loans and a reduction in the unallocated loss adjustment expense reserve.\n",
      "During 2012, we recognized $78 million of favorable prior year loss reserve development due to higher than expected cancellation rates on first lien legacy claims, combined with improving frequency trends and strong recoveries in second lien claims.\n",

      "Net Loss Development by Accident Year\n",
      "For 2014, the favorable development in accident years 2013 and 2012 was driven by Financial Lines, Commercial Property and other short tailed lines, like Personal Lines. For accident year 2007, the favorable development was driven by U.S. and Canada Financial lines and Excess Casualty. For accident years 2004 and prior, the adverse development was driven by the Excess Casualty results of the mass-tort resegmentation analysis, the updated primary workers’ compensation loss development selections (principally in California, New York and the excess of deductible segments) as well as the run-off pollution products business (1987-2004) and the asbestos and environmental (1986 and prior) exposure.\n",
      "For 2013, the favorable development from accident year 2012 was driven primarily by consumer lines and lower losses in domestic commercial property, while the favorable development from accident year 2010 was primarily the result of favorable claims emergence from domestic excess casualty and from liability and financial lines coverage policies that are on a claims made basis. The adverse development from accident year 2011 was driven by large losses in financial lines and adverse development in primary casualty, including the loss-sensitive business. The adverse development from accident year 2009 was driven by large losses in financial lines and adverse development in primary casualty including loss-sensitive business. For the same periods, the adverse development from accident years 2003 and prior was primarily driven by loss development on toxic tort claims, construction general liability claims and pollution product claims.\n",
      "For 2012, the favorable development from accident year 2011 was driven primarily by the favorable development on natural catastrophes, primarily the Tohoku Catastrophe, and the adverse development from accident years 2003 and prior was primarily the result of the increase in reserves on runoff pollution product business (policies written between 1987 and 2003).\n",
      "For certain categories of claims (e.g., construction defect claims and environmental claims) and for reinsurance recoverable, losses may sometimes be reclassified to an earlier or later accident year as more information about the date of occurrence becomes available to AIG.

      "The main sources of unfavorable prior year development for accident years 2004 and prior, representing 95 percent of the total recorded in 2012 through 2014, are as follows:\n",
      "• Update of the mass tort loss development patterns used for U.S. Excess Casualty which accounted for $301 million and other loss emergence including specific large loss development totaling $196 million across the three years;\n",
      "• Loss sensitive business that is entirely offset by premium adjustments accounted for $96 million;\n",
      "• Update of the loss development patterns used for U.S. Primary Casualty including loss development patterns used in guaranteed cost workers’ compensation in CA and NY, the construction class of business and updates to the loss development patterns for business written on excess of deductible exposures in workers’ compensation, general liability and the commercial auto classes of business which collectively accounted for approximately $577 million across the three years;\n",
      "• Update of the Environmental run-off portfolio’s losses following the 2012 comprehensive claims review that provided a more refined approach for the development of actuarial estimates for toxic tort claims (which were found to have a distinctly lengthier loss development pattern than other general liability claims in the environmental portfolio) as well as a more appropriate methodology for incorporating case reserving based estimates of ultimate loss costs for complex claims involving environmental remediation and/or from policies with high policy limits (greater than $5 million per policy). These updates which commenced in 2012 and have been applied in each subsequent year, accounted for approximately $561 million;\n",
      "• Update of our net retained asbestos and environmental exposure from 1986 and prior which accounted for approximately $266 million ($196 million environmental and $70 million asbestos) across the three years; and\n",
      "• Commutations in the three-year period ending December 31, 2014, accounted for approximately $162 million. These commutations serve to reduce the uncertainty in AIG’s required reserves.\n",
      "During the period 2012 to 2014, we completed comprehensive refinements of our reserving methodologies for U.S. mass tort, toxic tort, retained asbestos, environmental and other specific large losses. We also conducted extensive additional studies to corroborate our judgments for our U.S. primary workers compensation and excess workers’ compensation classes of business. Further, we refined our loss reserving methodologies for our U.S. Excess Casualty class of business and our U.S. Primary Casualty class of business written over excess of deductible exposures where loss development patterns may lengthen if client retentions increase over time. Collectively, the reserves for the aforementioned classes of business or loss exposures account for the majority of the remaining net loss reserves for accident years 2004 and prior.\n",

      "Loss Reserve Estimates - Asbestos and Environmental\n",
      "We consider a number of factors and recent experience, in addition to the results of both external and internal analyses, to estimate asbestos and environmental loss reserves. Nonetheless, we believe that significant uncertainty remains as to our ultimate liability for asbestos and environmental claims, which is due to several factors, including:\n",
      "• the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation, leading to the potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims;\n",
      "• claims filed under the non-aggregate premises or operations section of general liability policies;\n",
      "• the number of insureds seeking bankruptcy protection and the effect of prepackaged bankruptcies;\n",
      "• diverging legal interpretations; and\n",
      "• the difficulty in estimating the allocation of remediation cost among various parties with respect to environmental claims.\n",
      "In 2014, both the retained accounts and retroceded account ground-up reviews for asbestos were updated. As a result, we decreased gross undiscounted asbestos loss reserves by $6 million and increased net undiscounted asbestos loss reserves by $64 million. The net undiscounted increase reflects a buyout settlement on a retained account as well as a reduction in estimated ceded loss reserves (prior to the retroactive reinsurance retrocession). For environmental, we increased gross environmental reserves by $140 million and net environmental reserves by $60 million as a result of top-down actuarial analyses performed during the year as well as development on a number of large accounts.\n",
      "In 2013, we completed a ground-up review of all our remaining retained accounts for asbestos. In addition, a subsidiary of the retrocessionaire for our retroactive reinsurance contract completed a ground-up asbestos study for the largest accounts it assumed. As a result, we increased gross asbestos loss reserves by $169 million and net asbestos loss reserves by $6 million. The net reserve increase also reflects a small amount of estimated uncollectible reinsurance. A significant portion of these loss reserves will be recoverable under our retroactive reinsurance arrangement. For environmental, we increased gross environmental reserves by $98 million and net environmental reserves by $61 million as a result of top-down actuarial analyses performed during the year as well as development on a number of large accounts.\n",
      "In 2012, after considering recent experience compared to the results of our most recent ground-up analysis, as well as all of the above factors related to uncertainty, no adjustment to gross and net asbestos reserves was recognized. Additionally in 2012, a moderate amount of incurred loss pertaining to the asbestos loss reserve discount is reflected in the table below and is related to the reserves not subject to our retroactive reinsurance agreement. Upon completion of a top-down analysis performed for environmental in the fourth quarter of 2012, we concluded that the $150 million gross reserve strengthening and $75 million net reserve strengthening recognized in the first half of 2012 was adequate.\n",
      "In addition to the U.S. asbestos and environmental reserve amounts shown in the tables below, the Non - Life Insurance Companies also have asbestos reserves relating to foreign risks written by non-U.S. entities of $132 million gross and $105 million net as of December 31, 2014.

      "On June 17, 2011, we completed a transaction under which the bulk of AIG Property Casualty’s net domestic asbestos liabilities were transferred to National Indemnity Company (NICO), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. This was part of our ongoing strategy to reduce our overall loss reserve development risk. This transaction covers potentially volatile U.S.-\n",

      "related asbestos exposures. It does not, however, cover asbestos accounts that we believe have already been reserved to their limit of liability or certain other ancillary asbestos exposure assumed by AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries.\n",
      "Upon the closing of this transaction, but effective as of January 1, 2011, we ceded the bulk of AIG Property Casualty’s net domestic asbestos liabilities to NICO under a retroactive reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of $3.5 billion. Within this aggregate limit, NICO assumed collection risk for existing third-party reinsurance recoverable associated with these liabilities. AIG Property Casualty paid NICO approximately $1.67 billion as consideration for this cession and NICO assumed approximately $1.82 billion of net U.S. asbestos liabilities. As a result of this transaction, AIG Property Casualty recorded a deferred gain of $150 million in the second quarter of 2011, which is being amortized into income over the settlement period of the underlying claims.\n",
      "Under retroactive reinsurance arrangements any recoveries for development associated with the ceded losses are not recognized immediately; rather this development increases or decreases the deferred gain, and is amortized into income as described above. During 2013, we recognized approximately $86 million of adverse loss development that was ceded under this reinsurance arrangement, which was partially offset by $15 million of deferred gain amortization. This development, net of the deferred gain amortization, is being reported in Other income/expense, consistent with the way we manage the business and assess performance and is therefore excluded from net losses incurred and our loss ratios to avoid distortion related to our ongoing insurance business.\n",

      "The following table presents a summary of asbestos and environmental claims count activity:\n",
      "(a) The number of environmental claims dismissed or otherwise resolved, increased substantially during 2012 as a result of Non-Life Insurance Companies determination that certain methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) claims presented no further potential for exposure since these underlying claims were resolved through dismissal, settlement, or trial for all of the accounts involved. All of these accounts were fully reserved at the account level and included adequate reserves for those underlying individual claims that contributed to the actual losses.

The survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims. Therefore, the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would take before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments.\n",
      "Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resulting survival ratio.

For variable annuities in the Retirement Income Solutions product line, the assumed annual growth rate has remained above zero percent for the five-year reversion to the mean period and therefore has not met the criteria for adjustment; however, additional favorable equity market performance in excess of long-term assumptions could result in unlocking in this product line in the future, with a positive effect on pre-tax income in the period of the unlocking. See Critical Account Estimates - Estimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products (Life Insurance Companies) for additional discussion of assumptions related to our reversion to the mean methodology.\n",

      "DAC and Reserves Related to Unrealized Appreciation of Investments\n",
      "DAC for universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the change in DAC as if fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (shadow DAC). The change in shadow DAC generally moves in the opposite direction of the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio. In addition, significant unrealized appreciation of investments in a prolonged low interest rate environment may cause additional future policy benefit liabilities to be recorded (shadow loss reserves). The increase in the Life Insurance Companies’ unrealized appreciation of investments in 2014 of $5.9 billion, which was driven by the decline in market interest rates, resulted in a decrease in shadow DAC and an increase in shadow loss reserves in 2014. Shadow loss reserves were insignificant at December 31, 2013 and increased to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2014. In 2013, shadow DAC increased and shadow loss reserves decreased due to an increase in market interest rates. The change in shadow DAC and shadow loss reserves in 2014 was greater than the change in 2013, due to a larger movement in unrealized appreciation of investments.\n",

Loss recognition expense attributable primarily to investment sales related to capital loss carryforward utilization was excluded from pre-tax operating income and reported within changes in benefit reserves and DAC, VOBA and SIA related to net realized capital gains (losses) in Results of Operations - Consumer Insurance. See Critical Accounting Estimates - Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health Insurance Contracts for additional discussion of loss recognition.\n",
      "The Life operating segment recorded loss recognition expense of $87 million in 2014 and $67 million in 2012, which reduced pre-tax operating income in the respective periods, to increase reserves for certain long-term care business. The 2014 loss recognition was primarily a result of lower future premium increase assumptions and, to a lesser extent, lower yield assumptions. The 2012 loss recognition reflected updated assumptions for morbidity and lower premium increases. Assumptions related to investment yields, mortality experience and expenses are reviewed periodically and updated as appropriate, which could also result in additional loss recognition reserves. While the domestic Life Insurance Companies do not currently offer standalone long-term care products, these needs are addressed with various benefits and riders in the existing portfolio, such as chronic illness riders.\n",

      "Liquidity and Capital Resources\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "Liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet our payment obligations. It is defined as cash and unencumbered assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost. We manage our liquidity prudently through various risk committees, policies and procedures, and a stress testing and liquidity framework established by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Our liquidity framework is designed to measure both the amount and composition of our liquidity to meet financial obligations in both normal and stressed markets. See Enterprise Risk Management - Risk Appetite, Identification, and Measurement and Enterprise Risk Management - Liquidity Risk Management below for additional information.\n",
      "Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. Our primary source of ongoing capital generation is the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. We must comply with numerous constraints on our minimum capital positions. These constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy for both AIG and the individual businesses and are based on internally-defined risk tolerances, regulatory requirements, rating agency and creditor expectations and business needs. Actual capital levels are monitored on a regular basis, and using ERM’s stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital impact of potential macroeconomic, financial and insurance stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraints of both AIG and our insurance subsidiaries.\n",
      "We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events.\n",
      "Nevertheless, some circumstances may cause our cash or capital needs to exceed projected liquidity or readily deployable capital resources. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash or capital needs and loss of sources of liquidity and capital. In addition, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.\n",
      "Depending on market conditions, regulatory and rating agency considerations and other factors, we may take various liability and capital management actions. Liability management actions may include, but are not limited, to repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers. Capital management actions may include, but are not limited to, paying dividends to our shareholders and share repurchases.\n",

      "(a) In January 2015, we received $2.2 billion in additional dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our Life Insurance Companies and, in February 2015, we received $600 million in additional cash dividends from our Non-Life Insurance Companies. These dividends had been declared during the three-month period ended December 31, 2014.\n",

      "The following table presents a summary of AIG’s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:\n",
      "Operating Cash Flow Activities\n",
      "Interest payments totaled $3.4 billion in 2014, compared to $3.9 billion in 2013 and $4.0 billion in 2012. Excluding interest payments, AIG generated positive operating cash flow of $8.3 billion, $9.7 billion and $7.7 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\n",
      "Insurance companies generally receive most premiums in advance of the payment of claims or policy benefits. The ability of insurance companies to generate positive cash flow is affected by the frequency and severity of losses under their insurance policies, policy retention rates and operating expenses.\n",
      "Cash provided by operating activities of our Non-Life Insurance Companies was $0.9 billion in 2014 compared to $0.4 billion in 2013 and $1.1 billion in 2012, primarily reflecting the timing of the payments related to catastrophe losses in each year.\n",
      "Cash provided by operating activities of our Life Insurance Companies was $4.4 billion in 2014, $4.3 billion in 2013 and $2.9 billion in 2012. The increase in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to higher pre-tax operating income and higher proceeds from legal settlements with financial institutions that participated in the creation, offering and sale of RMBS from which our Life Insurance Companies realized losses during the financial crisis.\n",
      "Cash provided by operating activities of businesses held for sale was $2.9 billion for each of 2013 and 2012.\n",
      "Investing Cash Flow Activities\n",
      "Net cash provided by investing activities in 2014 reflected:\n",
      "• a reduction in net investment purchase activity; and\n",
      "• approximately $2.4 billion of net cash proceeds from the sale of ILFC.\n",
      "Net cash provided by investing activities for 2013 included an increase in net investment purchase activity.\n",
      "Net cash provided by investing activities for 2012 includes:\n",
      "• payments received relating to the sale of the underlying assets held by ML II of approximately $1.6 billion;\n",

      "Liquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent and Subsidiaries\n",
      "AIG Parent\n",
      "As of December 31, 2014, AIG Parent had approximately $14.3 billion in liquidity sources. AIG Parent’s liquidity sources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, intermediate-term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Fixed maturity securities consist of U.S. government and government sponsored entity securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, and corporate and municipal bonds. AIG Parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. Based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, AIG Parent purchases publicly traded, intermediate-term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. These securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity. AIG Parent liquidity sources are monitored through the use of various internal liquidity risk measures. AIG Parent’s primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from subsidiaries, as well as credit and contingent liquidity facilities. AIG Parent’s primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, operating expenses and subsidiary capital needs.\n",
      "We generally manage capital flows between AIG Parent and its subsidiaries through internal, Board-approved policies and guidelines. In addition, AIG Parent has unconditional capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) in place with certain subsidiaries. Nevertheless, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer capital freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.\n",
      "We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy our reasonably foreseeable future requirements and meet our obligations to our creditors, debt-holders and insurance company subsidiaries. We expect to access the debt markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed.\n",
      "Item 7 / LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL rESOURCES\n",
      "We utilize our capital resources to support our businesses, with the majority of capital allocated to our core insurance operations. Should we have or generate more capital than is needed to support our business strategies (including organic growth or acquisition opportunities) or mitigate risks inherent to our business, we may develop plans to distribute such capital to shareholders via dividends or share repurchase authorizations or deploy such capital towards liability management.\n",
      "In the normal course, it is expected that a portion of the capital released by our core insurance operations or through the utilization of AIG’s deferred tax assets may be available for distribution to shareholders. Additionally, it is expected that capital associated with businesses or investments that do not directly support our core insurance operations may be available for distribution to shareholders or deployment towards liability management upon its monetization.\n",
      "In developing plans to distribute capital, AIG considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to: the capital resources available to support our core insurance operations and business strategies, AIG’s funding capacity and capital resources in comparison to internal benchmarks, expectations for capital generation, rating agency expectations for capital, as well as regulatory standards for capital and capital distributions.\n",
      "The following table presents AIG Parent's liquidity sources:\n",
      "(a) Cash and short-term investments include reverse repurchase agreements totaling $1.6 billion and $6.9 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n",
      "(b) $2.9 billion and $5.9 billion of cash and short-term investments as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, are allocated toward future maturities of liabilities and contingent liquidity stress needs of DIB and GCM.\n",

Our Non-Life Insurance Companies’ liquidity resources are held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.\n",
      "Certain Non-Life Insurance Companies are members of the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) in their respective districts. Borrowings from the FHLBs may be used to supplement liquidity. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, none of our Non-Life Insurance Companies had FHLB borrowings outstanding.\n",
      "Our Non-Life Insurance Companies may require additional funding to meet capital or liquidity needs under certain circumstances. Large catastrophes may require us to provide additional support to our affected operations. Downgrades in our credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, which could result in non-renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the subsidiary’s ability to meet its own obligations. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital. Other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include an economic collapse of a nation or region significant to our operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval.\n",

In addition, the CMA provides that if capital and surplus of this Mortgage Guaranty insurance company is in excess of that same specified minimum required capital, subject to its board approval and compliance with applicable insurance laws, this Mortgage Guaranty insurance company would declare and pay ordinary dividends to its equity holders up to an amount necessary to reduce projected or actual capital and surplus to a level equal to or not materially greater than such specified minimum required capital. As structured, the CMA contemplates that the specified minimum required capital would be reviewed and agreed upon at least annually. As of December 31, 2014, the minimum required capital for the CMA with the Mortgage Guaranty insurance company is based on a risk-to-capital ratio of 19 to 1.\n",

The fixed maturity securities included investment-grade government, corporate and sovereign bonds, as well as agency RMBS. In 2014, our Non-Life Insurance Companies also paid other non-cash dividends of $178 million to AIG Parent. In addition, our Non-Life Insurance Companies paid approximately $600 million of cash dividends to AIG Parent in February 2015, which represented the remainder of dividends that were declared by our Non-Life Insurance Companies in the fourth quarter of 2014.

      "The need to fund product surrenders, withdrawals and maturities creates a potential liquidity requirement for our Life Insurance Companies. Management believes that because of the size and liquidity of our Life Insurance Companies’ investment portfolios, normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience would not create significant liquidity risk. Furthermore, our Life Insurance Companies’ products contain certain features that mitigate surrender risk, including surrender charges. As part of their risk management framework, our Life Insurance Companies continue to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue strategies and programs to improve their liquidity position and facilitate their ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio.

Under these programs, these domestic Life Insurance Companies lend securities to financial institutions and receive cash as collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. Cash collateral received is invested in short-term investments. Additionally, the aggregate amount of securities that a Life Insurance Company is able to lend under its program at any time is limited to five percent of its general account statutory-basis admitted assets. There were no outstanding securities lent under these programs by our domestic Life Insurance Companies as of December 31, 2014.

We are focused on meeting the DIB’s liquidity needs, including the need for contingent liquidity arising from collateral posting for debt positions of the DIB, without relying on resources beyond the DIB. As part of this program management, we may from time to time access the capital markets, including issuing and repurchasing debt, and selling assets on an opportunistic basis, in each case subject to market conditions. If the DIB’s risk target is breached, we expect to take appropriate actions to increase the DIB’s liquidity sources or reduce liquidity requirements to maintain the risk target, although no assurance can be given that this can be achieved under then-prevailing market conditions. Any additional liquidity shortfalls would need to be funded by AIG Parent.\n",

The majority of these assets are carried at fair value. The DIB’s liabilities consist primarily of notes and other borrowings supported by assets as well as other short-term financing obligations. The DIB has both liabilities held at cost and liabilities held at fair value. The liabilities held at fair value vary in price based on changes in AIG’s credit spreads.

GCM is required to clear certain derivatives transactions through central regulated clearing organizations pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank). To the extent a derivatives transaction is subject to a clearing obligation, GCM is required to post collateral in amounts determined by the relevant clearing organization and GCM’s clearing agreements with its futures commission merchants. To the extent a derivatives transaction is not subject to a clearing obligation, these derivative transactions are governed by bilateral master agreements, the form of which is published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA). Many of these agreements, primarily between GCM and third party financial institutions, require collateral postings. Many of GCM’s transactions with AIG and its subsidiaries also include collateral posting requirements, the purpose of which are to provide collateral to GCM, which in turn is used to satisfy posting requirements with third parties, including the margin requirements of clearing organizations and futures commission merchants.\n",
      "In addition, most of GCM’s CDSs within AIGFP are subject to collateral posting provisions. The collateral posting provisions contained in the ISDA Master Agreements and related transaction documents with respect to CDSs differ among counterparties and asset classes. The amount of future collateral posting requirements for super senior CDSs is a function of our credit ratings, the rating of the relevant reference obligations and the market value of the relevant reference obligations, with market value being the most significant factor. We estimate the amount of potential future collateral postings associated with the super senior CDSs using various methodologies. The contingent liquidity requirements associated with such potential future collateral postings are incorporated into our liquidity planning assumptions.\n",

GCM’s liabilities consist primarily of unrealized losses on swaps, options and forwards. Collateral posted by GCM to third parties was $3.0 billion at both December 31, 2014 and 2013. GCM obtained collateral from third parties totaling $1.1 billion and $572 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

      "Loss Reserves\n",
      "Loss reserves relate to our Non-Life Insurance Companies and represent future losses and loss adjustment expense payments estimated based on historical loss development payment patterns. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the payments by period presented above could be materially different from actual required payments. We believe that our Non-Life Insurance Companies maintain adequate financial resources to meet the actual required payments under these obligations.\n",
      "Insurance and Investment Contract Liabilities\n",
      "Insurance and investment contract liabilities, including GIC liabilities, relate to our Life Insurance Companies. These liabilities include various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments of a term certain\n",

      "nature. These liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. For these policies and contracts (i) we are not currently making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event beyond our control.\n",
      "We have made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits. These assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force policies. Due to the significance of the assumptions, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. The amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n",
      "We believe that our Life Insurance Companies have adequate financial resources to meet the payments actually required under these obligations. These subsidiaries have substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments. In addition, our Life Insurance Companies maintain significant levels of investment grade rated fixed maturity securities, including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds, and could seek to monetize those holdings in the event operating cash flows are insufficient. We expect liquidity needs related to GIC liabilities to be funded through cash flows generated from maturities and sales of invested assets.\n",
      "Borrowings\n",
      "Our borrowings exclude those incurred by consolidated investments and include hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value. We expect to repay the long-term debt maturities and interest accrued on borrowings by AIG through maturing investments and dispositions of invested assets, future cash flows from operations, cash flows generated from invested assets, future debt issuance and other financing arrangements.\n",

      "(b) Includes commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and mutual funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the United States and abroad. The commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund, as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund. The expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund, consistent with past trends of requirements for funding. Investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate subsidiaries.\n",

      "We are subject to financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements in connection with our sales of businesses. These arrangements may be triggered by declines in asset values, specified business contingencies, the realization of contingent liabilities, litigation developments, or breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by us. These arrangements are typically subject to time limitations, defined by contract or by operation of law, such as by prevailing statutes of limitation. Depending on the specific terms of the arrangements, the maximum potential obligation may or may not be subject to contractual limitations. For additional information regarding our indemnification agreements, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "We have recorded liabilities for certain of these arrangements where it is possible to estimate them. These liabilities are not material in the aggregate. We are unable to develop a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential payout under some of these arrangements.

      "Credit Ratings\n",
      "Credit ratings estimate a company’s ability to meet its obligations and may directly affect the cost and availability of financing to that company. The following table presents the credit ratings of AIG and certain of its subsidiaries as of February 2, 2015. Figures in parentheses indicate the relative ranking of the ratings within the agency’s rating categories; that ranking refers only to the major rating category and not to the modifiers assigned by the rating agencies.\n",

      "These credit ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. They may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at our request.\n",
      "We are party to some agreements that contain “ratings triggers.” Depending on the ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies, these triggers could result in (i) the termination or limitation of credit availability or a requirement for accelerated repayment, (ii) the termination of business contracts or (iii) a requirement to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.\n",
      "In the event of adverse actions on our long-term debt ratings by the major rating agencies, AIGFP and certain other GCM entities would be required to post additional collateral under some derivative transactions or could experience termination of the transactions. Such requirements and terminations could adversely affect our business, our consolidated results of operations in a reporting period or our liquidity. In the event of a further downgrade of AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings, AIGFP and certain other GCM entities would be required to post additional collateral, and certain of the counterparties of AIGFP or of such other GCM entities would be permitted to terminate their contracts early.\n",
      "The actual amount of collateral that we would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade.\n",

      "Enterprise Risk Management\n",
      "Risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns. We consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance.\n",

      "Risk Governance Structure\n",
      "Our risk governance structure fosters the development and maintenance of a risk and control culture that encompasses all significant risk categories. Accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit. We review our governance and committee structure on a regular basis and make changes as appropriate to continue to effectively manage and govern our risks and risk-taking.\n",
      "Our Board of Directors oversees the management of risk through its Risk and Capital Committee (RCC) and Audit Committee. Those committees regularly interact with other committees of the Board of Directors. Our Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reports to both the RCC and AIG’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO).\n",
      "The Group Risk Committee (GRC) is the senior management group charged with assessing all significant risk issues on a global basis to protect our financial strength, optimize our intrinsic value, and protect our reputation. The GRC is chaired by our CRO. Its membership includes our CEO, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and other executives from across our corporate functions and business units. Our CRO reports periodically on behalf of the GRC to both the RCC and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\n",
      "Management committees that support the GRC are described below. These committees are comprised of senior executives and experienced business representatives from a range of functions and business units throughout AIG and its subsidiaries. These committees are charged with identifying, analyzing and reviewing specific risk matters within their respective mandates.\n",
      "Financial Risk Group (FRG): The FRG is responsible for the oversight of financial risks taken by AIG and its subsidiaries. Its mandate includes overseeing our aggregate credit, market, interest rate, capital, liquidity and model risks, as well as asset-liability management, derivatives activity, and foreign exchange transactions. Membership of the FRG includes our EVP -\n",

Our Deputy General Counsel serves as TABPC Chair and additional members include our CRO and CFO, and other senior executives from Finance, Legal, Treasury, Investments and our business units.\n",
      "Operational Risk Committee (ORC): This committee oversees operational risk management activities across AIG’s businesses, functions, and geographic locations. The ORC reviews the enterprise-wide identification, escalation and mitigation of operational risks that may arise from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or external events. The ORC also monitors current and emerging operational risks, as well as management actions taken to reduce risks to acceptable levels. The Committee approves the Operational Risk Management (ORM) Policy and ORM Framework, which includes the identification, assessment, monitoring and measurement of risks. The Committee ensures applicable governance structures are established to provide oversight of operational risk at each business unit and corporate function. The ORC also reviews aggregate firm-wide operational risk reports and provides a forum for senior management to assess our operational risk profile and to discuss operational risks that may affect our strategic objectives.\n",
      "ORC members include senior AIG executives with expertise in legal, compliance, technology, human resources, finance and operational risk, as well as business continuity management and the chief risk officers of our business units.\n",
      "Business Unit Risk and Capital Committees: Each of our major insurance businesses has established a risk and capital committee (BU RCC) that serves as the senior management committee responsible for risk oversight at the individual business unit level. The BU RCCs are responsible for the identification, assessment and monitoring of all sources of risk within their respective portfolios. Specific responsibilities include setting risk tolerances, approving capital management strategies (including asset allocation and risk financing), insurance portfolio optimization, risk management policies and providing oversight of risk-adjusted metrics. In addition to its BU RCC, each major insurance business has established subordinate committees which identify, assess and monitor the specific operational, transactional and financial risks inherent in its respective business. Together, the BU RCCs and AIG Risk Committees described above provide comprehensive risk oversight throughout the organization.\n",
      "Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement\n",
      "Risk Appetite Framework\n",
      "Our Risk Appetite Framework integrates stakeholder interests, strategic business goals and available financial resources. We intend to balance these by taking measured risks that are expected to generate repeatable, sustainable earnings and produce long-term value for our shareholders. The framework includes our Risk Appetite Statement approved by the Board of Directors\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "or a committee thereof and a set of supporting tools, including risk tolerances, risk limits and policies, which we use to manage our risk profile and financial resources.\n",
      "We articulate our aggregate risk-taking by setting risk tolerances on capital and liquidity measures. These measures are set at the AIG Parent as well as the legal entity level and cover consolidated and insurance company capital and liquidity ratios. We must comply with standards for capital adequacy and maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all our obligations as they come due in accordance with our internal capital management and liquidity policies. The risk appetite for our insurance operations inform the requirements for capital adequacy for individual legal entities. Our risk tolerances take into consideration regulatory requirements, rating agency expectations, and business needs. The GRC routinely reviews the level of risk taken by the consolidated organization in relation to the established risk tolerances. A consolidated risk report is also presented periodically, as required, to the RCC by our CRO.\n",
      "Risk Limits\n",
      "A key component of our Risk Appetite Framework is having a process in place that establishes and maintains appropriate limits on the material risks identified for our core businesses and allows monitoring and meeting of both internal and external stakeholder’s expectations. Our objectives include:\n",
      "• Monitoring of risks, providing early warning indicators, and ensuring timely oversight and enforceability;\n",
      "• Defining a consistent and transparent approach to limits governance from the group-level to regional entities; and\n",
      "• Alignment with Risk Appetite Statement, where applicable.\n",
      "To support the monitoring and management of AIG’s and its business units’ material risks, ERM has established a limits framework that employs a three-tiered hierarchy:\n",
      "• Level I Limits are AIG consolidated level limits. They define our aggregate maximum exposures for core risks within the boundaries set by the Risk Appetite Statement, and constrain our concentration in specific risk types. These limits are set to manage key risks identified by ERM and to meet requirements by regulators and rating agencies at a consolidated level. Level 1 Limits are reported to the FRG, GRC and RCC.\n",
      "• Level II Limits are business unit level limits. They define our appetite for specific, material risk taking activities within business units and corporate functions. These key risks are identified by ERM for the business unit and/or corporate function, and risk limits are developed to meet the specific requirements of regulators and rating agencies. Level II Limits are reported to the BU RCC and FRG.\n",
      "• Level III Limits monitor risk utilization on the regional or local level and are developed to address any specific requirements by regulators and rating agencies for that region not captured by the Level I and Level II limits. Level 3 Limits are reported at the local entity BU RCC.\n",
      "All limits are reviewed by the FRG, GRC or business unit level risk committees on a periodic basis and revisions, if applicable, are approved by those committees.\n",
      "The business units are responsible for complying with all risk limits. The ERM teams and chief risk officers within each business unit monitor such compliance and provide regular, timely reporting to our senior management and risk committees. Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner and are documented and escalated in accordance with their level of severity or materiality. Responsibility for addressing and/or remediating any breach rests with individuals within the specific unit that experienced the breach.\n",
      "Risk Identification and Measurement\n",
      "One tool we use to inform our Risk Appetite Framework is risk identification. We conduct risk identification through a number of processes at the business unit and corporate level focused on capturing our material risks and key areas of focus for follow-up risk management actions. A key initiative is our annual integrated bottom-up risk identification and assessment process\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "down to the product-line level. These processes are used as a critical input to enhance and develop our analytics for measuring and assessing risks across the organization.\n",
      "We employ various approaches to measure, monitor, and manage risk exposures, including the utilization of a variety of metrics and early warning indicators. We use a proprietary stress testing framework to measure our quantifiable risks. This framework is built on our existing ERM stress testing methodology for both insurance and non-insurance operations. The framework measures risk over multiple time horizons and under different levels of stress. We develop a range of stress scenarios based both on internal experience and regulatory guidance. The stress tests are intended to ensure that sufficient resources for our insurance company subsidiaries and the consolidated company are available under both idiosyncratic and systemic market stress conditions.\n",
      "The stress testing framework assesses our aggregate exposure to our most significant financial and insurance risks, including the risk in each of our key insurance company subsidiaries in relation to its statutory capital needs under stress, risks inherent in our non-insurance company subsidiaries, and risks to AIG consolidated capital. Using our stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital and earnings impact of potential stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraint of each business operation. We use this information to determine the resources needed at the AIG Parent level to support our subsidiaries and capital resources required to maintain consolidated company target capitalization levels.\n",
      "Credit Risk Management\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "Credit risk is defined as the risk that our customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due. Credit risk may also result from a downgrade of a counterparty’s credit ratings or a widening of its credit spreads.\n",
      "We devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures. These exposures may arise from, but are not limited to fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees and letters of credit.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Our credit risks are overseen and managed by ERM. ERM is assisted by credit functions headed by highly experienced credit professionals that take and manage our credit risk. Their primary role is to assure appropriate credit risk management in accordance with our credit policies and procedures relative to our credit risk parameters. Our Chief Credit Officer (CCO) and credit executives are primarily responsible for the development, implementation and maintenance of a risk management framework, which includes the following elements related to our credit risks:\n",
      "• developing and implementing our company-wide credit policies and procedures;\n",
      "• approving delegated credit authorities to our credit executives;\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "• developing methodologies for quantification and assessment of credit risks, including the establishment and maintenance of our internal risk rating process;\n",
      "• managing a system of credit and program limits, as well as the approval process for credit transactions, above limit exposures, and concentrations of risk that may exist or be incurred;\n",
      "• evaluating, monitoring, reviewing and reporting of credit risks and concentrations regularly with senior management; and\n",
      "• approving appropriate credit reserves, credit-related other-than-temporary impairments and corresponding methodologies in all credit portfolios.\n",
      "We monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require mitigants, such as third-party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, including commercial bank-issued letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. We treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, letters of credit and trust collateral accounts as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data.\n",
      "See Investments - Available for Sale Investments herein for further information on our credit concentrations and credit exposures.\n",
      "Market Risk Management\n",
      "Market risk is defined as the risk of adverse impact due to systemic movements in one or more of the following market risk drivers: equity and commodity prices, residential and commercial real estate values, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange, inflation, and their levels of volatility.\n",
      "We are engaged in a variety of insurance, investment and other financial services businesses that generate market risk, directly and indirectly. We are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets businesses, on both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet through on and off-balance sheet exposures. The chief risk officer within each business is responsible for properly identifying these risks, then ensuring that they are appropriately measured, monitored and managed in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the Chief Market Risk Officer (CMRO).\n",
      "The scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains documented risk-taking authorities, defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner consistent with our Risk Appetite Statement. Our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in these broad market observables, distinct from the idiosyncratic risks associated with individual assets that are addressed through our credit risk management function.\n",
      "Risk Identification\n",
      "Market risk focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in broad, external, predominantly market observable risks. Financial repercussions can include an adverse impact on results of operations, financial conditions, liquidity and capital.\n",
      "Each of the following systemic risks is considered a market risk:\n",
      "Equity prices. We are exposed to changes in equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments. Changes in equity prices can affect the valuation of publicly-traded equity shares, investments in private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and other equity-linked capital market instruments as well as equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance.\n",
      "Residential and commercial real estate values. Our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments. Changes in residential/commercial real estate prices can affect the valuation of residential/commercial mortgages, residential/commercial mortgage-backed securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential/commercial mortgages: trusts that include residential/commercial real estate and/or mortgages (REITs), and residential mortgage insurance contracts and commercial real estate investments.\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "Interest rates. Interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities. Lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and resulting product changes will generally reduce the attractiveness of our insurance products in the marketplace. Conversely, higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons. However, when rates rise quickly, there can be a temporary asymmetric U.S. GAAP accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income, and the offsetting decrease in the value of related liabilities may not be recognized. Changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, financial liabilities, insurance contracts including but not limited to fixed rate annuities, variable annuities and derivative contracts.\n",
      "Credit spreads. Credit spreads measure an instrument’s risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default-free instrument. Changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including but not limited to corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, AIG-issued debt obligations, credit derivatives and derivative credit valuation adjustments. Much like higher interest rates, wider credit spreads mean more investment income in the long-term. In the short term, quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities, which is largely reported in Other comprehensive income. A precipitous rise in credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the credit-worthiness of bond obligors, potentially resulting in default losses.\n",
      "Foreign exchange (FX) rates. We are a globally diversified enterprise with significant income, assets and liabilities denominated in, and significant capital deployed in, a variety of currencies. Changes in FX rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of balance sheet and income statement items as well as the settlement of cash flows exchanged in specific transactions.\n",
      "Commodity Prices. Changes in commodity prices (the value of commodities) can affect the valuation of publicly-traded commodities, commodity indices and derivatives on commodities and commodity indices.\n",
      "Inflation. Changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including AIG-issued debt obligations, derivatives and other contracts explicitly linked to inflation indices, and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly, via indexing, or implicitly, through medical costs or wage levels.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Market risk is managed at the corporate level within ERM through the CMRO, who reports directly to the AIG CRO. The CMRO is supported by a dedicated team of professionals within ERM who work in partnership with the senior management of our finance, treasury and investment management corporate functions. The CMRO is primarily responsible for the development and maintenance of a risk management framework that includes the following key components:\n",
      "• written policies that define the rules for our market risk-taking activities and provide clear guidance regarding their execution and management;\n",
      "• a limit framework that aligns with our Board-approved Risk Appetite Statement;\n",
      "• independent measurement, monitoring and reporting for line of business, business unit and enterprise-wide market risks; and\n",
      "• clearly defined authorities for all individuals and committee roles and responsibilities related to market risk management.\n",
      "These components facilitate the CMRO’s identification, measurement, monitoring, reporting and management of our market risks.\n",
      "Risk Measurement\n",
      "Our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures. At the firm-wide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with AIG’s Risk Appetite Statement. This is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework. Our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "and liquidity levels under specific stress tests. At the market risk level, the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change on an economic basis.\n",
      "In addition, we continue to enhance economic, U.S. GAAP accounting and statutory capital-based risk measures at the market risk level, business-unit level and firm-wide levels. This process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures.\n",
      "Market Risk Sensitivities\n",
      "The following table provides estimates of our sensitivity to changes in yield curves, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates:\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "(a) At December 31, 2014, the analysis covered $290 billion of $309 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded are $1 billion in DIB assets, $8 billion of loans, and $4 billion of investments in life settlements. In addition, $5 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations. At December 31, 2013, the analysis covered $283 billion of $306 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. Excluded are $6 billion in DIB assets, $5 billion of loans, and $4 billion of investments in life settlements. In addition, $8 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling and/or data limitations.\n",
      "(b) Commencing in the first quarter of 2014, we began using a duration and convexity method to estimate the impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on each security. The change in method had no material effect on the amounts presented at December 31, 2013.\n",
      "(c) Includes our investments in PICC Group and PICC P&C.\n",
      "(d) The majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag.\n",
      "Foreign currency-denominated net asset position reflects our consolidated non-U.S. dollar assets less our consolidated non-U.S dollar liabilities on a U.S. GAAP basis. We use a bottom-up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory capital at the regulated insurance entity level. We manage cash flow risk on our foreign currency-denominated debt issued by AIG Parent and use a variety of techniques to mitigate this risk, including but not limited to the execution of cross-currency swaps and the issuance of new foreign currency-denominated debt to replace equivalent maturing debt. At the AIG Parent level, we monitor our foreign currency exposures against single currency and aggregate currency portfolio limits. As a matter of general practice, we do not typically hedge our foreign currency exposures to net investments in subsidiaries. However, we may utilize either cross-currency swaps or our foreign currency- denominated debt as a net investment hedge of our capital in subsidiaries.\n",
      "At December 31, 2014, our five largest foreign currency net asset positions were denominated in British pounds, Canadian dollars, Euro, Hong Kong dollars and Japanese yen. Our foreign currency-denominated net asset position at December 31, 2014 increased by 16.0 percent, or $1.7 billion, compared to December 31, 2013. The increase was mostly due to a $650 million increase in our Hong Kong dollar position, primarily resulting from the Non-Life Insurance Companies investment in PICC P&C; a $585 million increase in our British pound position, primarily resulting from AIG Parent repurchasing outstanding British pound-denominated debt; a $378 million increase in our Japanese yen position, mainly attributable to Japanese yen deferred tax liability reduction; a $153 million increase in our Canadian dollar position, mainly attributable to an increase in operating income from underwriting and investments; and a $75 million increase in our Euro position primarily resulting from AIG Parent repurchasing outstanding Euro-denominated debt. These increases were partially offset by a $173 million decrease in our Polish zloty position, primarily resulting from the sale of our equity investment in Santander Consumer Bank.\n",
      "For illustrative purposes, we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The estimated results presented in the table above should not be taken as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events.\n",
      "The sensitivity factors utilized for 2014 and presented above were selected based on historical data from 1994 to 2014, as follows (see the table below):\n",
      "• a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve is consistent with a one standard deviation movement of the benchmark ten-year treasury yield;\n",
      "• a 20 percent drop for equity and alternative investments is broadly consistent with a one standard deviation movement in the S&P 500; and\n",
      "• a 10 percent depreciation of foreign currency exchange rates is consistent with a one standard deviation movement in the U.S. dollar (USD)/Great Britain pound (GBP) exchange rate.\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "Risk Monitoring and Limits\n",
      "The risk monitoring responsibilities, owned by the business units, include ensuring compliance with market risk limits and escalation and remediation of limit breaches. Such activities must be reported to the ERM Market Risk team by the relevant business unit. This monitoring approach is aligned with our overall risk limits framework.\n",
      "To control our exposure to market risk, we rely on a three-tiered hierarchy of limits that the CMRO closely monitors and reports to our CRO, senior management and risk committees.\n",
      "See Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification, and Measurement - Risk Limits herein for further information on our three-tiered hierarchy of limits.\n",
      "Liquidity Risk Management\n",
      "Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations. Failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in insolvency, reduced operating flexibility, increased costs, reputational harm and regulatory action.\n",
      "AIG and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity during both the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash can be generated to meet the obligations as they come due.\n",
      "AIG Parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are established for base and stress scenarios over a time horizon covering a period of up to one year. We maintain a liquidity buffer designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions. If we project that we will breach the tolerance, we will assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions. However, the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements.\n",
      "Risk Identification\n",
      "The following sources of liquidity and funding risks could impact our ability to meet short-term financial obligations as they come due.\n",
      "• Market/Monetization Risk: Assets cannot be readily transformed into cash due to unfavorable market conditions. Market liquidity risk may limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs.\n",
      "• Cash Flow Mismatch Risk: Discrete and cumulative cash flow mismatches or gaps over short-term horizons under both expected and adverse business conditions may create future liquidity shortfalls.\n",
      "• Event Funding Risk: Additional funding is required as the result of a trigger event. Event funding risk comes in many forms and may result from a downgrade in credit ratings, a market event, or some other event that created a funding obligation or limits existing funding options.\n",
      "• Financing Risk: We are unable to raise additional cash on a secured or unsecured basis due to unfavorable market conditions, AIG-specific issues, or any other issue that impedes access to additional funding.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Liquidity risk is managed at the corporate level within ERM through the CMRO, who reports directly to the AIG CRO. The AIG CRO has responsibility for the oversight of the Liquidity Risk Management Framework and delegates day-to-day implementation of this framework to the AIG Treasurer, with ERM oversight.\n",
      "The Liquidity Risk Management Framework is guided by the liquidity risk tolerance as set forth in the Board-approved Risk Appetite Statement. The principal objective of this framework is to establish minimum liquidity requirements that protect our\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "long-term viability and ability to fund our ongoing business, and to meet short-term financial obligations in a timely manner in both normal and stressed conditions.\n",
      "Our Liquidity Risk Management Framework includes a number of liquidity and funding policies and monitoring tools to address AIG-specific, broader industry and market related liquidity events.\n",
      "Risk Measurement\n",
      "Comprehensive cash flow projections under normal conditions are the primary component for identifying and measuring liquidity risk. We produce comprehensive liquidity projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows. In addition, we perform stress testing by identifying liquidity stress scenarios and assessing the effects of these scenarios on our cash flow and liquidity.\n",
      "Relevant liquidity reporting is produced and reported regularly to AIG Parent and business unit risk committees. The frequency, content, and nature of reporting will vary for each business unit and legal entity, based on its complexity, risk profile, activities and size.\n",
      "Operational Risk Management\n",
      "Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss, or other adverse consequences, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or from external events. Operational risk includes legal risk, but excludes business and strategy risks.\n",
      "Operational risk is inherent in each of our business units and corporate functions. Operational risks can have many impacts, including but not limited to: unexpected economic losses or gains, reputational harm due to negative publicity, regulatory action from supervisory agencies, operational and business disruptions, and/or damage to customer relationships.\n",
      "Our ORM function, which supports our ORC, has the responsibility to provide an aggregate view of our operational risk profile. Our ORM function oversees the Operational Risk policy and framework, which includes risk identification, assessment, monitoring and measurement. The ORM program captures various types of risk to provide an aggregate view for each business and function. This includes operational risks related to core insurance activities, investing, model risk, technology (including cyber security, access, data privacy and data security), third party providers, compliance and regulatory matters.\n",
      "Each business unit is responsible for managing its operational risks and implementing the components of the operational risk management program. In addition, certain corporate control functions have been assigned accountability for enterprise-wide operational risk management for their respective areas. These control functions include Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), Business Continuity Management (BCM), Information Technology Security Risk and Compliance, Model Validation and Vendor Risk\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "Management. Senior business operational risk executives report to their respective business unit CRO and to the Head of our ORM. This reporting structure is designed to enable close alignment with the business unit while ensuring consistent implementation of operational risk management practices.\n",
      "As part of the ORM framework, we deploy an integrated risk assessment approach which includes top-down risk assessments to identify our most significant operational risks, a Risk and Control Self Assessment (RCSA) process to identify key operational risks conducted at the business units and corporate functions and the identification of emerging risks through our Vulnerability Identification (VID) process which considers risks that have not yet fully manifested but could become significant over time. In addition, we conduct scenario analysis to identify remote but plausible potential risks that could result in severe financial losses. Corrective action plans are developed to address identified issues. Businesses are accountable for tracking and remediating these issues.\n",
      "Operational risk management reporting to senior management and operational risk governance committees provides awareness of operational risk exposures, identifies key risks and facilitates management decision making. Reporting includes operational risk mitigation and monitoring, RCSA results and the status of issue resolution to senior management.\n",
      "Insurance Operations Risks\n",
      "Except as described above, we manage our business risk oversight activities through our insurance operations. A primary goal in managing our insurance operations is to achieve an acceptable risk-adjusted return on equity. To achieve this goal, we must be disciplined in risk selection, premium adequacy, and appropriate terms and conditions to cover the risk accepted.\n",
      "Our insurance businesses are conducted on a global basis and expose us to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. We manage these risks throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of procedures:\n",
      "• pre-launch approval of product design, development and distribution;\n",
      "• underwriting approval processes and authorities;\n",
      "• exposure limits with ongoing monitoring;\n",
      "• modeling and reporting of aggregations and limit concentrations at multiple levels (policy, line of business, product group, country, individual/group, correlation and catastrophic risk events);\n",
      "• compliance with financial reporting and capital and solvency targets;\n",
      "• use of reinsurance, both internal and third-party; and\n",
      "• review and establishment of reserves.\n",
      "We closely manage insurance risk by monitoring and controlling the nature and geographic location of the risks in each line of business underwritten, the terms and conditions of the underwriting and the premiums we charge for taking on the risk. We analyze concentrations of risk using various modeling techniques, including both probability distributions (stochastic) and/or single-point estimates (deterministic) approaches.\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "Risk Identification\n",
      "• Non-Life Insurance Companies - risks covered include property, casualty, fidelity/surety, accident and health, aviation, management liability and mortgage insurance. We manage risks in the general insurance business through aggregations and limitations of concentrations at multiple levels: policy, line of business, geography, industry and legal entity. We manage risks in the mortgage insurance business through geographic classification, risk based pricing, premium adequacy monitoring, and prudent credit policy and underwriting standards.\n",
      "• Life Insurance Companies - risks include mortality and morbidity in the insurance-oriented products and insufficient cash flows to cover contract liabilities and longevity risk in the retirement savings-oriented products. We manage risks through product design, sound medical and non-medical underwriting, and external reinsurance programs.\n",
      "We purchase reinsurance for our insurance operations. Reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. We may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis. Pooling of our reinsurance risks enables us to purchase reinsurance more efficiently at a consolidated level, manage global counterparty risk and relationships and manage global catastrophe risks, both for the Non-Life Insurance Companies and the Life Insurance Companies.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Insurance risks are managed at the business unit level within ERM through the business unit chief risk officers, who report directly to the AIG CRO. Oversight is provided by the business unit chief risk officers. The business unit chief risk officers and their teams work closely with management to manage insurance risks. The framework includes the following key components:\n",
      "• written policies that define the rules for our insurance risk-taking activities;\n",
      "• a limit framework focused on key insurance risks that aligns with our Board-approved Risk Appetite Statement; and\n",
      "• clearly defined authorities for all individuals and committee roles and responsibilities related to insurance risk management.\n",
      "Risk Measurement, Monitoring and Limits\n",
      "In addition, we monitor concentrations of exposure through insurance limits aggregated along dimensions such as geography, industry, or counterparty.\n",
      "Non-Life Insurance Companies Key Insurance Risks\n",
      "We manage insurance risks through risk review and selection processes, exposure limitations, exclusions, deductibles, self-insured retentions, coverage limits, attachment points, and reinsurance. This management is supported by sound underwriting practices, pricing procedures and the use of actuarial analysis to help determine overall adequacy of provisions for insurance. Underwriting practices and pricing procedures incorporate historical experience, changes in underlying exposure, current regulation and judicial decisions as well as proposed or anticipated regulatory changes.\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "For Non-Life Insurance Companies, insurance risks primarily include the following:\n",
      "• Liability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses - The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the Non-Life Insurance Companies. There is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. We manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. See Item 1. Business - A review of Liability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses herein for further information.\n",
      "• Underwriting - The potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the Non-Life Insurance Companies ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. This may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, worse than expected prepayment of policies, investment results, or expenses.\n",
      "• Catastrophe Exposure - Our business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect our operating results. Other risks, such as man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n",
      "• Reinsurance - Since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers either due to an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event, or that actual reinsurance coverage is different than anticipated. The inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n",
      "Natural Catastrophe Risk\n",
      "We manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate Probable Maximum Loss (PML) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.\n",
      "We use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. We apply a proprietary multi-model approach to account for relative strengths and weaknesses of vendor models, and make adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.\n",
      "We perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model weaknesses, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. Lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts which allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.\n",
      "We recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policy to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. For example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. In addition, we are committed to providing innovative insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change, including expanding natural disaster resilience, promoting adaptation, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Our internal product development, underwriting, modeling, and sustainability practices will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.\n",
      "Our natural catastrophe exposure is primarily driven by the U.S. and Japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries. For example, we have exposures to additional perils such as European windstorms and floods. Within the U.S., we have significant hurricane exposure in Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, Northeast U.S. and mid-Atlantic regions. Events impacting the Northeast U.S. and the mid-Atlantic may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "due to our relative share of exposure in those regions. Within the U.S., we have significant earthquake exposure in California, the Pacific Northwest and New Madrid regions. Earthquakes impacting the Pacific Northwest and New Madrid regions may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in these regions.\n",
      "The estimates below are the Occurrence Exceedance Probability (OEP) losses, which reflect losses that may occur in any single event due to the defined peril. The 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 PMLs are the probable maximum losses from a single natural catastrophe event with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively.\n",
      "The following table presents an overview of modeled losses (OEP) for top perils and countries.\n",
      "(a) The U.S. hurricane amount includes losses to Property from hurricane hazards of wind and storm surge.\n",
      "(b) U.S. earthquake loss estimates represent exposure to Property, Workers’ Compensation (U.S.) and A&H business lines.\n",
      "(c) Japan Earthquake represents exposure to Property and A&H business lines.\n",
      "The OEP estimates provided above reflect our in-force portfolios at September 30, 2014, for U.S. exposures, and at June 30, 2014 for Japan exposures. The catastrophe reinsurance program is as of January 1, 2015.\n",
      "As noted above, AIG, along with other non-life insurance and reinsurance companies, utilizes industry-recognized catastrophe models and apply their proprietary modeling processes and assumptions to arrive at loss estimates. The use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially change the projected losses. Since there is no industry standard for assumptions and preparation of insured data for use in these models, modeled losses may not be comparable to estimates made by other companies.\n",
      "Also, the modeled results are based on the assumption that all reinsurers fulfill their obligations to us under the terms of the reinsurance arrangements and all catastrophe bonds attach and pay as modeled. However, reinsurance recoverable may not be fully collectible. In particular, the use of catastrophe bonds may not provide commensurate levels of protection compared to traditional reinsurance transactions. Therefore, these estimates are inherently uncertain and may not accurately reflect our exposure to these events.\n",
      "Our 2015 catastrophe reinsurance program includes coverage for natural catastrophes and some coverage for terrorism events. It consists of a large North American occurrence cover (without reinstatement) to protect against a large U.S. loss, and a worldwide aggregate cover to protect against multiple, potentially smaller, losses. The attachment point for this reinsurance program is at $3 billion.\n",
      "Actual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios. The occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors - Reserves and Exposures for additional information.\n",
      "Terrorism Risk\n",
      "We actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. We have set risk limits based on modeled losses from certain terrorism attack scenarios. Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model and various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the Non-Life Insurance Companies exposures. Examples of modeled scenarios are conventional bombs of different sizes, anthrax attacks and nuclear attacks.\n",
      "Our largest terrorism exposures are in New York City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers’ Compensation lines of business. At our largest exposure location, modeled losses for a five-ton bomb attack net of the\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) and reinsurance recoveries are estimated to be $3.1 billion as of September 30, 2014. We also have smaller terrorism exposure in Canadian cities and in London.\n",
      "Our exposure to terrorism risk is mitigated by TRIA in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIA covers terrorist attacks within the United States or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law. In 2015, TRIA covers 85 percent of insured losses above a deductible, decreasing by one percent each year to 80 percent in 2020. The current estimate of our deductible is about $2.7 billion for 2014.\n",
      "We offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks.\n",
      "Mortgage Risk\n",
      "For Mortgage Guaranty, the potential exposure to loss is due to borrower default on a first-lien residential mortgage; the primary drivers of this risk are changes in mortgage underwriting standards, home price depreciation, changes in the unemployment rate, changes in mortgage rates, and mortgagee behavior.\n",
      "Mortgage Guaranty manages the quality of the loans it insures through use of a proprietary risk quality index. Mortgage Guaranty uses this index to determine an insurability threshold as well as to manage the risk distribution of its new business. Along with traditional mortgage underwriting variables, Mortgage Guaranty’s risk-based pricing model uses rating factors such as geography and the historical quality of a lender’s origination process to establish premium rates.\n",
      "Reinsurance Recoverable\n",
      "AIG’s reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of:\n",
      "• Paid losses recoverable - balances due from reinsurers for losses and loss adjustment expenses paid by our subsidiaries and billed, but not yet collected.\n",
      "• Ceded loss reserves - ultimate ceded reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, including reserves for claims reported but not yet paid and estimates for IBNR.\n",
      "• Ceded reserves for unearned premiums.\n",
      "At December 31, 2014, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $22.0 billion. These assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $1.5 billion, ceded loss reserves of $15.7 billion including reserves for IBNR, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $3.0 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverables of $1.8 billion. The methods used to estimate IBNR and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. These methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments are reflected in income. We believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at December 31, 2014 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. Actual losses may, however, differ, perhaps materially, from the reserves currently ceded.\n",
      "The Reinsurance Credit Department (RCD) conducts periodic detailed assessments of the financial strength and condition of current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic. The RCD monitors both the financial condition of reinsurers as well as the total reinsurance recoverable ceded to reinsurers, and set limits with regard to the amount and type or exposure we are willing to take with reinsurers. As part of these assessments, we attempt to identify whether a reinsurer is appropriately licensed, assess its financial capacity and liquidity; and evaluate the local economic and financial environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates. The RCD reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for measures, including collateral to mitigate credit risk. For example, in our treaty reinsurance contracts, we frequently include provisions that require a reinsurer to post collateral or use other measures to reduce exposure when a referenced event occurs. Furthermore, we limit our unsecured exposure to reinsurers through the use of credit triggers such as insurer financial strength rating downgrades, declines in regulatory capital, or specified declines in risk-based capital (RBC) ratios. We also set maximum limits for reinsurance recoverable exposure, which in some cases is the recoverable amount plus an estimate of the maximum potential\n",
      "Item 7 / enterprise risk management\n",
      "exposure from unexpected events for a reinsurer. In addition, credit executives within ERM review reinsurer exposures and credit limits and approve reinsurer credit limits above specified levels. Finally, even where we conclude that uncollateralized credit risk is acceptable, we require collateral from active reinsurance counterparties where it is necessary for our subsidiaries to recognize the reinsurance recoverable assets for statutory accounting purposes. At December 31, 2014, we held $7.4 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers. We believe that no exposure to a single reinsurer represents an inappropriate concentration of risk to AIG, nor is our business substantially dependent upon any single reinsurance contract.\n",
      "The following table presents information for each reinsurer representing in excess of five percent of our total reinsurance recoverable assets:\n",
      "(a) The financial strength ratings reflect the ratings of the various reinsurance subsidiaries of the companies listed as of February 10, 2015.\n",
      "(b) Total reinsurance assets include both the Non-Life Insurance Companies and the Life Insurance Companies reinsurance recoverable.\n",
      "(c) Excludes collateral held in excess of applicable balances.\n",
      "(d) Includes $1.5 billion recoverable under the 2011 retroactive reinsurance transaction pursuant to which a large portion of the Non-Life Insurance Companies net domestic asbestos liabilities were transferred to NICO. Does not include reinsurance assets ceded to other reinsurers for which NICO has assumed the collection risk. See Liability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses - Transfer of Domestic Asbestos Liabilities.\n",
      "At December 31, 2014, we had no significant general reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. Reinsurer capital levels continued to increase in 2014, thereby increasing the industry’s underwriting capacity. This increased capacity has resulted in increased competition and lower rates for 2015 renewals. Reduced profitability associated with lower rates could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. The RCD, in conjunction with the credit executives within ERM, reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require the reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.\n",
      "See Item 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates - Reinsurance Assets for further discussion of reinsurance recoverable.\n",
      "Life Insurance Companies Key Insurance Risks\n",
      "Life Insurance Companies manage these risks through product design, experience monitoring, pricing actions, risk limitations, reinsurance and active monitoring and management of the relationships between assets and liabilities, including hedging.

For a further discussion of this risk, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Business and Operations.\n",
      "For Life Insurance Companies, insurance risks primarily include the following:\n",
      "• Mortality risk - represents the risk of loss arising from actual mortality rates being higher than expected mortality rates. This risk could arise from pandemics or other events, including longer-term societal changes that cause higher than expected mortality. This risk exists in a number of our product lines but is most significant for our life insurance products.\n",

This risk exists in a number of our product lines but is most significant for our retirement, institutional and annuity products.\n",
      "• Client behavioral risk including surrender/lapse risk - there are many assumptions made when products are sold including how long the contracts will persist. Actual experience can vary significantly from these assumptions. This risk is\n",

      "impacted by a number of factors including changes in market conditions, tax law, regulations and policyholder preferences. This risk exists in the majority of our product lines.\n",
      "• Interest rate risk - represents the potential for loss due to a change in interest rates. Interest rate risk is measured with respect to assets, liabilities (both insurance-related and financial), and derivatives. This risk manifests itself when interest rates move significantly in a short period of time (interest rate shock) but can also manifest itself over a longer period of time such as a persistent low interest rate environment.\n",
      "• Equity risk - represents the potential for loss due to changes in equity prices. It affects equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities (and associated guaranteed living and death benefits), universal life insurance, and variable universal life insurance. It also affects our equity investments and equity-related investments. In addition, changes in the volatility of equity prices can affect the valuation of those insurance products that are accounted for in a manner similar to equity derivatives.\n",

      "Global Capital Markets\n",
      "GCM actively manages its exposures to limit potential economic losses, and in doing so, GCM must continually manage a variety of exposures including credit, market, liquidity and operational risks. The senior management of AIG defines the policies and establishes general operating parameters for GCM’s operations. Our senior management has established various oversight committees to regularly monitor various financial market, operational and credit risks related to GCM’s operations. The senior management of GCM reports the results of its operations to and reviews future strategies with AIG’s senior management.\n",
      "GCM Derivative Transactions\n",
      "A counterparty may default on any obligation to us, including a derivative contract. Credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and/or carrying trading and investment positions. Credit risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to AIG. The maximum potential exposure will increase or decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions. To help manage this risk, GCM operates within the guidelines set by the credit function within ERM. Transactions that fall outside these pre-established guidelines require the specific approval of ERM. It is also AIG’s policy to record credit valuation adjustments for potential counterparty default when necessary.\n",
      "In addition, GCM utilizes various credit enhancements, including letters of credit, guarantees, collateral, credit triggers, credit derivatives, margin agreements and subordination to reduce the credit risk relating to its outstanding financial derivative transactions. GCM requires credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties, and transaction size and maturity. Furthermore, GCM enters into certain agreements that have the benefit of set-off and close-out netting provisions, such as ISDA Master Agreements, repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. These provisions provide that, in the case of an early termination of a transaction, GCM can set off its receivables from a counterparty against its payables to the same counterparty arising out of all covered transactions. As a result, where a legally enforceable netting agreement exists, the fair value of the transaction with the counterparty represents the net sum of estimated fair values.\n",

A business classified as held for sale is recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell.

The consideration had a value of approximately $5.4 billion based on AerCap’s pre-announcement closing price per share of $24.93 on December 13, 2013. Upon closing of the transaction on May 14, 2014, we recorded the 97.6 million AerCap shares received at their then fair value of $47.01 and, together with the next cash received, recorded pre-tax and after-tax gains of approximately $2.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2014. We determined ILFC met the criteria for held-for-sale accounting at December 31, 2013. Because we received approximately 46 percent of the common stock of AerCap upon closing of the transaction and we continued to hold such percentage at December 31, 2014, ILFC does not qualify for discontinued operations presentation in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The importance of any specific assumption can vary by both class of business and accident year. Because actual experience can differ from key assumptions used in establishing reserves, there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves. This is particularly true for long-tail casualty classes of business such as excess casualty, asbestos, D&O, and primary or excess workers’ compensation.\n",
      "All of our methods to calculate net reserves include assumptions about estimated reinsurance recoveries and their collectability. Reinsurance collectability is evaluated independently of the reserving process and appropriate allowances for uncollectible reinsurance are established.\n",

      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "Overview of Loss Reserving Process and Methods\n",
      "The Non-Life Insurance Companies’ loss reserves can generally be categorized into two distinct groups. Short-tail classes of business consist principally of property, Personal Insurance and certain casualty classes. Long-tail casualty classes of business include excess and umbrella liability, D&O, professional liability, medical malpractice, workers’ compensation, general liability, products liability and related classes.\n",
      "Short-Tail Reserves\n",
      "For operations writing short-tail coverages, such as property, the process for recording non-catastrophe quarterly loss reserves is generally geared toward maintaining incurred but not reported reserves based on percentages of net earned premiums for that business, rather than determining an ultimate loss ratio for current business based on reported losses. For example, the IBNR reserve required for the latest accident quarter for a class of property business might be expected to approximate 20 percent of the most recent quarter’s earned premiums. This level of reserve would generally be maintained regardless of the actual losses emerging in the current quarter. The percent of premium factor would reflect both the expected ultimate cost for reported claims and the expected percentage of losses that have not yet been reported. The expected ultimate loss costs generally reflect the average loss ratio from a period of preceding years that have been adjusted for changes in rate and loss cost levels, mix of business, known exposure to unreported losses, or other factors affecting the particular class of business. The expected percentage of losses that have not yet been reported would be derived from historical loss emergence patterns. IBNR for claims arising from catastrophic events or events of unusual severity would be determined using alternative techniques in close collaboration with the claims department. For some classes, a loss development factor method or percentage of monthly losses method may be used to determine IBNR reserves.\n",
      "Long-Tail Reserves\n",
      "Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss adjustment expenses (net losses) for long-tail casualty classes of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the class and volume of business, as well as estimates of the reinsurance recoverable. Experience in the more recent accident years shows limited statistical credibility in reported net losses on long-tail casualty classes of business. That is because a relatively low proportion of net incurred losses represent reported claims and expenses, and an even smaller percentage represents net losses paid. Therefore, IBNR constitutes a relatively high proportion of net losses.\n",
      "To estimate net losses for long-tail casualty classes\n",
      "of business, we\n",
      "use a variety of actuarial methods and assumptions.\n",
      "To estimate net losses for long-tail casualty classes of business, we use a variety of actuarial methods and assumptions and other analytical techniques as described below. A detailed reserve review is generally performed at least once per year to allow for comprehensive actuarial evaluation and collaboration with claims, underwriting, business unit management, risk management and senior management.\n",
      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "We generally make a number of actuarial assumptions in the review of reserves for each class of business.\n",
      "We record quarterly changes in loss reserves for each of the Non-Life Insurance Companies classes of business. The overall change in our loss reserves is based on the sum of the changes for all classes of business. For most long-tail classes of business, the quarterly loss reserve changes are based on the estimated current loss ratio for each class of coverage less any amounts paid. Also, any change in estimated ultimate losses from prior accident years deemed to be necessary based on the results of our latest reserve studies or large loss analysis, either positive or negative, is reflected in the loss reserve for the current quarter.\n",
      "Details of the Loss Reserving Process\n",
      "The process of determining the current loss ratio for each class of business is based on a variety of factors. These include considerations such as: prior accident year and policy year loss ratios; rate changes; and changes in coverage, reinsurance, or mix of business. Other considerations include actual and anticipated changes in external factors such as trends in loss costs, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, inflation, employment rates or unemployment duration, stock market volatility, corporate bond spreads, or in the legal and claims environment. The current loss ratio for each class of business is intended to represent our best estimate of the current loss ratio after reflecting all of the relevant factors. At the close of each quarter, the assumptions underlying the loss ratios are reviewed to determine if the loss ratios remain appropriate. This process includes a review of the actual claims experience in the quarter, actual rate changes achieved, actual changes in coverage, reinsurance or mix of business, and changes in other factors that may affect the loss ratio. When this review suggests that the initially determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate, the loss ratio for current business is changed to reflect the revised assumptions.\n",
      "We conduct a comprehensive loss reserve review at least annually for each of the Non-Life Insurance Company and class of business. The reserve analysis for each class of business is performed by the actuarial personnel who are most familiar with that class of business. In this process, the actuaries are required to make numerous assumptions, including the selection of loss development factors and loss cost trend factors. They are also required to determine and select the most appropriate actuarial methods for each business class. Additionally, they must determine the segmentation of data that will enable the most suitable test of reserve adequacy. In the course of these detailed reserve reviews an actuarial central estimate of the loss reserve is determined. The sum of these central estimates for each class of business provides an overall actuarial central estimate of the loss reserve for that class.\n",
      "We continue to consult with third party environmental litigation and engineering specialists, third party toxic tort claims professionals, third party clinical and public health specialists, third party workers’ compensation claims adjusters and third party actuarial advisors to help inform our judgments. In 2014, the third party actuarial reviews covered the majority of net reserves held for our Commercial long-tail classes of business, and run-off portfolios reported in Corporate and Other.\n",

      "Loss reserve development can also be affected by commutations of assumed and ceded reinsurance agreements.\n",
      "Actuarial and Other Methods for Major Classes of Business\n",
      "In testing the reserves for each class of business, our actuaries determine the most appropriate actuarial methods. This determination is based on a variety of factors including the nature of the claims associated with the class of business, such as the frequency or severity of the claims. Other considerations include the loss development characteristics associated with the claims, the volume of claim data available for the applicable class, and the applicability of various actuarial methods to the class. In addition to determining the actuarial methods, the actuaries determine the appropriate loss reserve groupings of data. For example, we write many unique subclasses of professional liability. For pricing or other purposes, it is appropriate to evaluate the profitability of each subclass individually. However, for purposes of estimating the loss reserves for many classes of business, we believe it is appropriate to combine the subclasses into larger groups to produce a greater degree of credibility in the claims experience. This determination of data segmentation and actuarial methods is carefully considered for each class of business. The segmentation and actuarial methods chosen are those which together are expected to produce the most robust estimate of the loss reserves.\n",
      "The actuarial methods we use for most long-tail casualty classes of business include loss development methods, expected loss ratio methods, including “Bornhuetter Ferguson” methods described below, and frequency/severity models. Loss development methods utilize the actual loss development patterns from prior accident years to project the reported losses to an ultimate basis for subsequent accident years. Loss development methods generally are most appropriate for classes of business which exhibit a stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next, and for which the components of the classes have similar development characteristics. For example, property exposures would generally not be combined into the same class as casualty exposures, and primary casualty exposures would generally not be combined into the same class as excess casualty exposures. In 2014, we continued to refine our loss reserving techniques for the domestic primary casualty classes of business and adopted further segmentations based on our analysis of the differing emerging loss patterns for certain classes of insureds. We generally use expected loss ratio methods in cases where the reported loss data lacks sufficient credibility to utilize loss development methods, such as for new classes of business or for long-tail classes at early stages of loss development. Frequency/severity models may be used where sufficient frequency counts are available to apply such approaches.\n",
      "Expected loss ratio methods rely on the application of an expected loss ratio to the earned premium for the class of business to determine the loss reserves. For example, an expected loss ratio of 70 percent applied to an earned premium base of $10 million for a class of business would generate an ultimate loss estimate of $7 million. Subtracting any reported paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve for this class. Under the “Bornhuetter Ferguson” methods, the expected loss ratio is applied only to the expected unreported portion of the losses. For example, for a long-tail class of business for which only 10 percent of the losses are expected to be reported at the end of the accident year, the expected loss ratio would be applied to the 90 percent of the losses still unreported. The actual reported losses at the end\n",
      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "of the accident year would be added to determine the total ultimate loss estimate for the accident year. Subtracting the reported paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve. In the example above, the expected loss ratio of 70 percent would be multiplied by 90 percent. The result of 63 percent would be applied to the earned premium of $10 million resulting in an estimated unreported loss of $6.3 million. Actual reported losses would be added to arrive at the total ultimate losses. If the reported losses were $1 million, the ultimate loss estimate under the “Bornhuetter Ferguson” method would be $7.3 million versus the $7 million amount under the expected loss ratio method described above. Thus, the “Bornhuetter Ferguson” method gives partial credibility to the actual loss experience to date for the class of business. Loss development methods generally give full credibility to the reported loss experience to date. In the example above, loss development methods would typically indicate an ultimate loss estimate of $10 million, as the reported losses of $1 million would be estimated to reflect only 10 percent of the ultimate losses.\n",
      "A key advantage of loss development methods is that they respond quickly to any actual changes in loss costs for the class of business. Therefore, if loss experience is unexpectedly deteriorating or improving, the loss development method gives full credibility to the changing experience. Expected loss ratio methods would be slower to respond to the change, as they would continue to give more weight to the expected loss ratio, until enough evidence emerged to modify the expected loss ratio to reflect the changing loss experience. On the other hand, loss development methods have the disadvantage of overreacting to changes in reported losses if the loss experience is not credible. For example, the presence or absence of large losses at the early stages of loss development could cause the loss development method to overreact to the favorable or unfavorable experience by assuming it will continue at later stages of development. In these instances, expected loss ratio methods such as “Bornhuetter Ferguson” have the advantage of recognizing large losses without extrapolating unusual large loss activity onto the unreported portion of the losses for the accident year.\n",
      "Frequency/severity methods generally rely on the determination of an ultimate number of claims and an average severity for each claim for each accident year. Multiplying the estimated ultimate number of claims for each accident year by the expected average severity of each claim produces the estimated ultimate loss for the accident year. Frequency/severity methods generally require a sufficient volume of claims in order for the average severity to be predictable. Average severity for subsequent accident years is generally determined by applying an estimated annual loss cost trend to the estimated average claim severity from prior accident years. In certain cases, a structural approach may also be used to predict the ultimate loss cost. Frequency/severity methods have the advantage that ultimate claim counts can generally be estimated more quickly and accurately than can ultimate losses. Thus, if the average claim severity can be accurately estimated, these methods can more quickly respond to changes in loss experience than other methods. However, for average severity to be predictable, the class of business must consist of homogeneous types of claims for which loss severity trends from one year to the next are reasonably consistent. Generally these methods work best for high frequency, low severity classes of business such as personal auto.\n",
      "Structural drivers analytics seek to explain the underlying drivers of frequency/severity. A structural drivers analysis of frequency/severity is particularly useful for understanding the key drivers of uncertainty in the ultimate loss cost. For example, for the excess workers’ compensation class of business, we have attempted to corroborate our judgment by considering the impact on severity of the future propensity for deterioration of an injured worker’s medical condition, the impact of price inflation on the various categories of medical expense and cost of living adjustments on indemnity benefits, the impact of injured worker mortality and claim specific settlement and loss mitigation strategies, etc., using the following:\n",
      "• Claim by claim reviews to determine the stability and likelihood of settling an injured worker’s indemnity and medical benefits - the claim file review was facilitated by third party specialists experienced in workers’ compensation claims;\n",
      "• Analysis of the potential for future deterioration in medical condition unlikely to be picked up by a claim file review and associated with potentially costly medical procedures (i.e., increases in both utilization and intensity of medical care) over the course of the injured worker’s lifetime;\n",
      "• Analysis of the cost of medical price inflation for each category of medical spend (services and devices) and for cost of living adjustments in line with statutory requirements;\n",
      "• Portfolio specific mortality level and mortality improvement assumptions based on a mortality study conducted for AIG’s primary and excess workers’ compensation portfolios and AIG’s opinion of future longevity trends for the open reported cases;\n",
      "• Ground-up consideration of the reinsurance recoveries expected for the class of business for reported claims with extrapolation for unreported claims; and\n",
      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "• The effects of various run-off claims management strategies that have been developed by AIG’s run-off unit.\n",
      "During 2014, we continued to expand our analysis of structural drivers as a means of corroborating our judgments using traditional actuarial techniques. For example, we considered the impact of changes in economic activity (real GDP growth) on our emerging experience in the Commercial Auto Liability class of business, particularly business written in excess of a large insured deductible where ground up experience may take several years to pierce our layer. Further, we considered the impact of expected levels of future inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Deflator (Health Services Component) published by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis on our ultimate loss costs for medical benefits in the primary workers’ compensation class of business. We believe the PCE Deflator provides a more appropriate measure of workers’ compensation medical inflation as it includes medical expenditures made by employers on behalf of their employees. We also tested the sensitivity of our estimates to changes in the future path and level of inflation for this class of business.\n",
      "Overall, our loss reserve reviews for long-tail classes typically utilize a combination of both loss development and expected loss ratio methods, supplemented by structural drivers analysis of frequency/severity where available. Loss development methods are generally given more weight for accident years and classes of business where the loss experience is highly credible. Expected loss ratio methods are given more weight where the reported loss experience is less credible, or is driven more by large losses. Expected loss ratio methods require sufficient information to determine the appropriate expected loss ratio. This information generally includes the actual loss ratios for prior accident years, and rate changes as well as underwriting or other changes which would affect the loss ratio. Further, an estimate of the loss cost trend or loss ratio trend is required to allow for the effect of inflation and other factors which may increase or otherwise change the loss costs from one accident year to the next.\n",
      "The estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims. This is due to inconsistent court decisions, as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies or have expanded theories of liability. In addition, reinsurance recoverable balances relating to asbestos and environmental loss reserves are subject to greater uncertainty due to the underlying age of the claim, underlying legal issues surrounding the nature of the coverage, and determination of proper policy period. For these reasons, these balances tend to be subject to increased levels of disputes and legal collection activity when actually billed. The insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures.\n",
      "We continue to receive claims asserting injuries and damages from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged claims to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites, referred to collectively as environmental claims, and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. The vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained absolute exclusions for pollution-related damage and asbestos. The current Non-Life Insurance Companies Environmental policies that we specifically price and underwrite for environmental risks on a claims-made basis have been excluded from the analysis.\n",
      "The majority of our exposures for asbestos and environmental claims are excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages.

The methods used to determine asbestos and environmental loss estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated by management.\n",
      "Various factors contribute to the complexity and difficulty in determining the future development of claims. Significant factors that influence the claims estimation process include court resolutions and judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage. The current case law can be characterized as still evolving, and there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop in the near future. Additionally, the exposures for cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites\n",

      "If the asbestos and environmental reserves develop deficiently, resulting deficiencies could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations for an individual reporting period.\n",
      "With respect to known environmental claims, we established over two decades ago a specialized environmental claims unit, which investigates and adjusts all such environmental claims. This unit evaluates environmental claims utilizing a claim-by-claim approach that involves a detailed review of individual policy terms and exposures. Because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, we generally evaluate exposure on a policy-by-policy basis, considering a variety of factors such as known facts, current law, jurisdiction, policy language and other factors that are unique to each policy. Quantitative techniques must be supplemented by subjective considerations, including management judgment. Each claim is reviewed at least semi-annually utilizing the aforementioned approach and adjusted as necessary to reflect the current information.\n",
      "The environmental claims unit also actively manages and pursues early resolution with respect to these claims in an attempt to mitigate its exposure to the unpredictable development of these claims. We attempt to mitigate our known long-tail environmental exposures through a combination of proactive claim-resolution techniques, including policy buybacks, complete environmental releases, compromise settlements, and, when appropriate, litigation.\n",

      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "Alternative Loss Cost Trend and Loss Development Factor Assumptions by Class of Business\n",
      "For classes of business other than the classes discussed below, there is generally some potential for deviation in both the loss cost trend and loss development factor assumptions.\n",
      "The effect of these deviations is expected to be smaller than the effect on the classes noted below:\n",
      "Loss cost trends: The percentage deviations noted in the table below are not considered the highest possible deviations that might be expected, but rather what we consider to reflect a reasonably likely range of potential deviation. The impacts cited\n",
      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "below are only for the years using an expected loss ratio approach. Actual loss cost trends in the early 1990s were negative for several years whereas actual loss cost trends exceeded the figures cited below for 1997 through 2001. Loss trends may deviate by more than the amounts noted above and discussed below.\n",
      "Loss development factors: The percentage deviations noted in the table below are not considered the highest possible deviations that might be expected, but rather what we consider to reflect a reasonably likely range of potential deviation. While multiple scenarios are performed, the assumed loss development factors are a key assumption. Generally, actual historical loss development factors are used to project future loss development. Future loss development patterns may be different from those in the past, or may deviate by more than the amounts noted above and discussed below.\n",
      "AIG’s loss reserve analyses do not generally provide a range of loss reserve estimates. A large portion of the loss reserves from the Non-Life Insurance Companies business relates to longer-tail casualty classes of business, such as excess casualty and D&O, which are driven by severity rather than frequency of claims. Using the reserving methodologies described above, our actuaries determine their actuarial central estimates of the loss reserves and advise management on their final recommendation for management’s best estimate of the recorded reserves. Subject matter experts from underwriting and claims play an important part in informing the actuarial assumptions and methods. The governance process over the establishment of loss reserves also ensures robust considerations of the changes in the loss trends, terms and conditions, claims handling practices, and large loss impact when determining the methods, assumptions and the estimations. This multi-disciplinary process engages underwriting, claims, risk management, business unit executives and senior management and involves several iterative levels of feedback and response during the regular reserving process.\n",
      "The sensitivity analysis below addresses each major class of business for which there is a possibility of a material deviation from our overall reserve position. The analysis uses what we believe is a reasonably likely range of potential deviation for each class. Actual reserve development may not be consistent with either the original or the adjusted loss trend or loss development factor assumptions, and other assumptions made in the reserving process may materially affect reserve development for a particular class of business.\n",

      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "The following sensitivity analysis table summarizes the effect on the loss reserve position of using certain alternative loss cost trend (for accident years where we use expected loss ratio methods) or loss development factor assumptions rather than the assumptions actually used in determining our estimates in the year-end loss reserve analyses in 2014.\n",
      "(a) Loss cost trend assumption does not have a material impact for this line of business.\n",
      "(b) Percentages not applicable due to extremely long-tailed nature of workers’ compensation.\n",
      "(c) Impact was determined based on analysis of aggregate variability of loss development assumptions.\n",
      "Reinsurance Assets\n",
      "The estimation of reinsurance recoverable involves a significant amount of judgment, particularly for latent exposures, such as asbestos, due to their long-tail nature. Reinsurance assets include reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses that are estimated as part of our loss reserving process and, consequently, are subject to similar judgments and uncertainties as the estimation of gross loss reserves.\n",
      "We assess the collectability of reinsurance recoverable balances through either detailed reviews of the underlying nature of the reinsurance balance or comparisons with historical trends of disputes and credit events. We record adjustments to reflect the results of these assessments through an allowance for uncollectable reinsurance that reduces the carrying amount of reinsurance assets in the balance sheet. This estimate requires significant judgment for which key considerations include:\n",
      "• paid and unpaid amounts recoverable;\n",
      "• whether the balance is in dispute or subject to legal collection;\n",
      "• whether the reinsurer is financially troubled (i.e., liquidated, insolvent, in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction); and\n",
      "• whether collateral and collateral arrangements exist.\n",
      "At December 31, 2014, the allowance for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance was $258 million.\n",
      "See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on reinsurance.\n",
      "Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health Insurance Contracts (Life Insurance Companies)\n",
      "Long-duration traditional products include whole life insurance, term life insurance, accident and health insurance, long-term care insurance, and certain payout annuities for which the payment period is life-contingent, which include certain of our single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements.\n",
      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "For long-duration traditional business, a “lock-in” principle applies. The assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and DAC are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. The assumptions include mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses, and investment returns. These assumptions are typically consistent with pricing inputs. The assumptions also include margins for adverse deviation, principally for key assumptions such as mortality and interest rates used to discount cash flows, to reflect uncertainty given that actual experience might deviate from these assumptions. Establishing margins at contract inception requires management judgment. The extent of the margin for adverse deviation may vary depending on the uncertainty of the cash flows, which is affected by the volatility of the business and the extent of our experience with the product.\n",
      "Loss recognition occurs if observed changes in actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses under loss recognition testing. To determine whether loss recognition exists, we determine whether a future loss is expected based on updated current assumptions. If a loss recognition exists, we recognize the loss by first reducing DAC through amortization expense, and, if DAC is depleted, record additional liabilities through a charge to policyholder benefit expense. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on loss recognition. Because of the long-term nature of many of our liabilities subject to the “lock-in” principle, small changes in certain assumptions may cause large changes in the degree of reserve adequacy. In particular, changes in estimates of future invested asset returns have a large effect on the degree of reserve deficiency.\n",
      "Groupings for loss recognition testing are consistent with our manner of acquiring and servicing the business and applied by product groupings. We perform separate loss recognition tests for traditional life products, payout annuities, and long-term care insurance. Once loss recognition has been recorded for a block of business, the old assumption set is replaced and the assumption set used for the loss recognition would then be subject to the lock-in principle. Key judgments made in loss recognition tests include the following:\n",
      "• To determine investment returns used in loss recognition tests, we typically segregate assets that match liabilities and then project future cash flows on those assets. Our projections include a reasonable allowance for investment expenses and expected credit losses over the projection horizon. A critical assumption in the projection of expected investment income is the assumed net rate of investment return at which excess cash flows are to be reinvested. For products in which asset and liability durations are matched relatively well, this is less of a consideration since interest on excess cash flows are not a significant component of future cash flows. For the reinvestment rate assumption, anticipated future changes to the yield curves could have a large effect. Given the interest rate environment applicable at the date of our loss recognition tests, we assumed a modest and gradual increase in long-term interest rates over time.\n",
      "• For mortality assumptions, key judgments include the extent of industry versus own experience to base future assumptions as well as the extent of expected mortality improvements in the future. The latter judgment is based on a combination of historical mortality trends, advice from industry public health and demography specialists that were consulted by AIG’s actuaries and published industry information.\n",
      "• For surrender rates, a key judgment involves the correlation between expected increases/decreases in interest rates and increases/decreases in surrender rates. To support this judgment, we compare crediting rates on our products relative to expected rates on competing products under different interest scenarios.\n",
      "• For in-force long-term care insurance, rate increases are allowed but must be approved by state insurance regulators. Consequently, the extent of rate increases that may be assumed requires judgment. In establishing our assumption for rate increases for long-term care insurance, we consider historical experience as to the frequency and level of rate increases approved by state regulators.\n",
      "The Life operating segment recorded loss recognition expense of $87 million in 2014 and $67 million in 2012 to increase reserves for certain discontinued long-term care business as a result of updated assumptions. Sales of investment securities in connection with our program to utilize capital loss carryforwards and other investment sales with subsequent reinvestment at lower yields triggered recording of loss recognition expense of $30 million, $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, primarily related to certain long-term payout annuity contracts in the Institutional Markets and Retirement operating segments. See Results of Operations - Life Insurance Companies DAC and Reserves - Loss Recognition for additional discussion.\n",
      "Significant unrealized appreciation on investments in a prolonged low interest rate environment may cause DAC to be adjusted and additional future policy benefit liabilities to be recorded through a charge directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (“shadow loss recognition”). These charges are included, net of tax, with the change in net unrealized appreciation of\n",
      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "investments. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on shadow loss recognition. In applying shadow loss recognition, the Company overlays unrealized gains onto loss recognition tests without revising the underlying test. Accordingly, there is limited additional judgment in this process.\n",
      "Guaranteed Benefit Features of Variable Annuity Products (Life Insurance Companies)\n",
      "Variable annuity products offered by our Retirement Income Solutions and Group Retirement product lines offer guaranteed benefit features. These guaranteed features include guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) that are payable in the event of death or other instances, and living benefits that are payable in the event of annuitization, or, in other instances, at specified dates during the accumulation period. Living benefits include guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB), guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB), and guaranteed minimum account value benefits (GMAV). See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these features. For GMDB, our most widely offered guaranteed benefit feature, the liabilities included in Future policyholder benefits at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $401 million and $355 million, respectively. The fair value of GMWB and GMAV embedded derivatives included in Policyholder contract deposits was a net liability of $957 million at December 31, 2014 and a net asset of $37 million at December 31, 2013.\n",
      "The liabilities for GMDB and GMIB, which are recorded in Future policyholder benefits, represent the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account value, with the excess recognized ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments, through Policyholder benefits and losses incurred. The liabilities for GMWB and GMAV, which are recorded in Policyholder contract deposits, are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value of the liabilities recorded in Other realized capital gains (losses).\n",
      "Our exposure to the guaranteed amounts is equal to the amount by which the contract holder’s account balance is below the amount provided by the guaranteed feature. A variable annuity contract may include more than one type of guaranteed benefit feature; for example, it may have both a GMDB and a GMWB. However, a policyholder can only receive payout from one guaranteed feature on a contract containing a death benefit and a living benefit, i.e. the features are mutually exclusive, so the exposure to the guaranteed amount for each feature is not additive to that of other features. A policyholder cannot purchase more than one living benefit on one contract. Declines in the equity markets, increased volatility and a sustained low interest rate environment increase our exposure to potential benefits under the guaranteed features, leading to an increase in the liabilities for those benefits. See Estimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products (Life Insurance) below for sensitivity analysis which includes the sensitivity of reserves for guaranteed benefit features to changes in the assumptions for equity market returns, volatility and mortality. For a further discussion of the risks related to guaranteed benefit features of variable annuities, our dynamic hedging program and risks of AIG’s unhedged exposures, see Item 1A. - Risk Factors - Business and Operations.\n",
      "The reserving methodology and assumptions used to measure the liabilities of our two largest guaranteed benefit features are presented in the following table:\n",
      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "Estimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products (Life Insurance Companies)\n",
      "Policy acquisition costs and policy issuance costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal of existing insurance contracts related to universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) are generally deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over a period that approximates the estimated lives of the contracts, except in instances where significant negative gross profits are expected in one or more periods. Estimated gross profits include net investment income and spreads, net realized investment gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses, and mortality gains and losses. In estimating future gross profits, lapse assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on DAC amortization. For fixed deferred annuity contracts, the future spread between investment income and interest credited to policyholders is a significant judgment, particularly in a low interest rate environment.\n",
      "If the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC and related reserves, including VOBA, SIA, guaranteed benefit reserves and URR, are recalculated using the new assumptions, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. Updating such assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.\n",
      "In estimating future gross profits for variable annuity products, a long-term annual asset growth assumption of 8.5% (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected) is applied to estimate the future growth in assets and related asset-based fees. In determining the asset growth rate, the effect of short-term fluctuations in the equity markets is partially mitigated through the use of a “reversion to the mean” methodology, whereby short-term asset growth above or\n",
      "Item 7 / CRITICAL aCCOUNTING eSTIMATES\n",
      "below the long-term annual rate assumption impacts the growth assumption applied to the five-year period subsequent to the current balance sheet date. The reversion to the mean methodology allows us to maintain our long-term growth assumptions, while also giving consideration to the effect of actual investment performance. When actual performance significantly deviates from the annual long-term growth assumption, as evidenced by growth assumptions for the five-year reversion to the mean period falling below a certain rate (floor) or above a certain rate (cap) for a sustained period, judgment may be applied to revise or “unlock” the growth rate assumptions to be used for both the five-year reversion to the mean period as well as the long-term annual growth assumption applied to subsequent periods. The use of a reversion to the mean assumption is common within the industry; however, the parameters used in the methodology are subject to judgment and vary within the industry.\n",
      "In the fourth quarter of 2013, we revised the growth rate assumptions for the five-year reversion to the mean period for the Group Retirement product line, because annual growth assumptions indicated for that period had fallen below our floor of zero percent due to the favorable performance of equity markets. For this five-year reversion to the mean period, the growth rate assumption was adjusted to a point between the long-term growth rate assumption and zero percent. This adjustment increased Retirement pre-tax operating income by $35 million in 2013. Had we readjusted the growth rate assumption for the five-year reversion to the mean period to use the long-term rate assumption of 8.5%, pre-tax income would have been higher by approximately $30 million. Conversely, had the growth rate assumption for the five-year reversion to the mean period been readjusted to a floor of zero percent, pre-tax income would have been lower by approximately $30 million. For variable annuities in our Retirement Income Solutions product line, the assumed annual growth rate has remained above zero percent for the five-year reversion to the mean period, so it has not met our criteria for adjustment; however, additional favorable equity market performance in excess of long-term assumptions could also result in “unlocking” in this product line in future periods with a positive effect on pre-tax income in the period of the unlocking.\n",
      "The following table summarizes the sensitivity of changes in certain assumptions in the amortization of DAC, SIA, guaranteed benefit reserves and URR, and the related hypothetical impact on year-end 2014 balances. The effect of changes in net investment spread primarily affects our Fixed Annuities product line. Changes in equity returns, volatility and interest rates primarily impact reserves for guarantee features of variable annuities in our Retirement Income Solutions and Group Retirement product lines. The effect of changes in mortality primarily impacts the universal life insurance business.\n",
      "(a) Represents the net impact of 1 percent increase or decrease in long-term equity returns for GMDB and GMIB reserves and negligible net impact of 1 percent increase or decrease in the S&P 500 index for living benefit reserves.\n",

      "(c) Represents the net impact of 10 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve on the reserves for GMWB and GMAV living benefit features. Does not represent interest rate spread compression on investment-oriented products.\n",

      "any correlation among the key assumptions. An assessment of sensitivity associated with changes in any single assumption would not necessarily be an indicator of future results.

      "Impairments on Investments in Life Settlements\n",
      "Impairments to investments in life settlements may occur in the future due to the fact that continued payment of premiums required to maintain policies will cause the expected lifetime undiscounted cash flows for some policies to become negative in future reporting periods, even in the absence of future changes to the mortality assumptions. Impairments may also occur due to our future sale or lapse of select policies at a value that is below carrying amount.\n",
      "For a discussion of impairments on investments in life settlements, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n",
      "Goodwill Impairment\n",
      "For a discussion of goodwill impairment, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2014 and 2013, AIG elected to bypass the qualitative assessment of whether goodwill impairment may exist and, therefore, performed quantitative assessments that supported a conclusion that the fair value of all of the reporting units tested exceeded their book value. To determine fair value, we primarily use a discounted expected future cash flow analysis that estimates and discounts projected future distributable earnings. Such analysis is principally based on AIG’s business projections that inherently include judgments regarding business trends.\n",
      "Liability for Legal Contingencies\n",
      "We estimate and record a liability for potential losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent such losses are probable and can be estimated. Determining a reasonable estimate of the amount of such losses requires significant management judgment. In many cases, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases that are in the early stages of litigation or in which claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, we often cannot predict the outcome or estimate the eventual loss or range of reasonably possible losses related to such matters.\n",
