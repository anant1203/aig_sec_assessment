New Hampshire is now integrated into this division as the AIG company focusing specifically on providing AIG products and services through brokers to middle market companies. The domestic brokerage division accepts business mainly from insurance brokers, enabling selection of specialized markets and retention of underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to submit business to these companies without the traditional agent-company contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no authority to commit the companies to accept a risk. In addition to writing substantially all classes of business insurance, including large commercial or industrial property insurance, excess liability, inland marine, workers\\' compensation and excess and umbrella coverages, the domestic brokerage division offers many specialized forms of insurance such as directors and officers liability, difference-in-conditions, kidnap-ransom, export credit and political risk, and various types of professional errors and omissions coverages. Lexington writes surplus lines, those risks for which conventional insurance companies do not readily provide insurance coverage, either because of complexity or because the coverage does not lend itself to conventional contracts. Audubon Insurance Company and its subsidiaries (\"Audubon\") conduct agency marketing of personal and small commercial coverages in certain Southern and Western States. American International Insurance Company (\"AIIC\") engages in mass marketing of personal lines coverages. Since 1992, AIIC increased its participation in non-standard auto business in urban markets. The business of United Guaranty Corporation (\"UGC\") and its subsidiaries is also included in the domestic operations\\nof AIG. The principal business of the UGC subsidiaries is the writing of residential mortgage loan insurance, which is guaranty insurance on conventional first mortgage loans on single-family dwellings and condominiums. Such insurance protects lenders against loss if borrowers default. UGC subsidiaries also write commercial mortgage loan insurance covering first mortgage loans on commercial real estate, home equity and property improvement loan insurance on loans to finance residential property improvements, alterations and repairs and for other purposes not necessarily related to real estate, and rent guaranty insurance on commercial and industrial real estate. UGC had approximately $10 billion of mortgage guarantee risk in-force at December 31, 1994. AIG\\'s foreign general insurance business comprises primarily risks underwritten through American International Underwriters (\"AIU\"), a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned agencies and insurance companies. It also includes business written by foreign-based insurance subsidiaries of AIUO for their own accounts. In general, the same types of policies and marketing methods, with certain refinements for local laws, customs and needs, are used in these foreign operations as have been described above in connection with the domestic operations. During 1994 domestic general and foreign general insurance business accounted for 67.0 percent and 33.0 percent, respectively, of AIG\\'s net premiums written. AIG\\'s general insurance company subsidiaries worldwide operate primarily by underwriting and accepting any size risk for their direct account and securing reinsurance on that portion of the risk in excess of the limit which they wish to retain. This operating policy differs from that of many insurance companies which will underwrite only up to their net retention limit, thereby requiring the broker or agent to secure commitments from other underwriters for the remainder of the gross risk amount. The following table summarizes general insurance premiums written and earned:\\nThe utilization of reinsurance is closely monitored by an internal reinsurance security committee, consisting of members of AIG\\'s Senior Management. No single reinsurer is a material reinsurer to AIG nor is AIG\\'s business substantially dependent upon any reinsurance contract. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG is well diversified both in terms of lines of business and geographic locations. Of the general insurance lines of business, workers\\' compensation was approximately 16 percent of AIG\\'s net premiums written. This line is well diversified geographically and is generally written on a retrospectively rated basis which reduces its exposure to material uncertainty or risks. Notwithstanding the above, the majority of AIG\\'s insurance business is in the casualty classes, which tend to involve longer periods of time for the reporting and settling of claims. This may increase the risk and uncertainty with respect to AIG\\'s loss reserve development. (See also the Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Net Loss and Loss Expense Reserve Development and Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nThe following table is a summary of the general insurance operations, including ratios, by major operating category for the year ended December 31, 1994.

Loss and expense ratios of AIG\\'s consolidated general insurance operations are set forth in the following table. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\n* Source: Best\\'s Aggregates & Averages (Stock insurance companies, after dividends to policyholders). The ratio for 1994 reflects estimated results provided by Conning & Company. During 1994, of the direct general insurance premiums written (gross premiums less return premiums and cancellations, excluding reinsurance assumed and before deducting reinsurance ceded), 9.7 percent and 10.2 percent were written in California and New York, respectively (no other state accounted for more than 5 percent of such premiums). There was no significant adverse effect on AIG\\'s results of operations from the economic environments in any one state, country or geographic region for the year ended December 31, 1994. DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED NET LOSS AND LOSS EXPENSE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT\\nThe reserve for net losses and loss expenses is exclusive of applicable reinsurance and represents the accumulation of estimates for reported losses (\"case basis reserves\") and provisions for losses incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\"). AIG does not discount its loss reserves other than for minor amounts related to certain workers\\' compensation claims. Loss reserves established with respect to foreign business are set and monitored in terms of the respective local or functional currency. Therefore, no assumption is included for changes in currency rates. (See also Note 1(t) of Notes to Financial Statements.) Losses and loss expenses are charged to income as incurred. Management continually reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves through the utilization of a number of analytical reserve development techniques (discussed below). Through the use of these techniques, management is able to monitor the adequacy of its established reserves, including the appropriate assumptions for inflation. Also, through reactions to the emergence of specific development patterns, such as case reserve redundancies or deficiencies and IBNR emergence, management is able to currently determine any required adjustments. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nThe \"Analysis of Consolidated Net Loss and Loss Expense Reserve Development\", which follows, presents the development of net loss and loss expense reserves for calendar years 1984 through 1994. The upper half of the table shows the cumulative amounts paid during successive years related to the opening loss reserves. For example, with respect to the net loss and loss expense reserve of $3,132.7 million as of December 31, 1984, by the end of 1994 (ten years later) $3,772.9 million\\nhad actually been paid in settlement of these net loss reserves. In addition, as reflected in the lower section of the table, the original reserve of $3,132.7 million was reestimated to be $4,119.7 million at December 31, 1994. This increase from the original estimate would generally be a combination of a number of factors, including reserves being settled for larger amounts than originally estimated.'),\n",

BUSINESS', 'filename': '5272_1994.txt', 'cik': '0000005272', 'year': 1994, 'chunk_index': 7}, page_content='The original estimates will also be increased or decreased as more information becomes known about the individual claims and overall claim frequency and severity patterns. The redundancy (deficiency) depicted in the table, for any particular calendar year, shows the aggregate change in estimates over the period of years subsequent to the calendar year reflected at the top of the respective column heading. For example, the redundancy of $122.7 million at December 31, 1994 related to December 31, 1993 net losses and loss expense reserves of $17,557.0 million represents the cumulative amount by which reserves for 1993 and prior years have developed redundantly during 1994. ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED NET LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT\\nThe trend depicted in the latest development year in the reestimated liability portion of the \"Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development\" table indicates that the overall position of AIG\\'s 1993 and prior reserves one year later is fairly comparable to the trends reflected in recent years. The variations in development from original reserves in the later years of the table are relatively insignificant both in terms of aggregate amounts and as a percentage of the initial reserve balances. RECONCILIATION OF NET RESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSES\\n* Does not include the effects of foreign exchange adjustments as described above, which are reflected in the above table. Approximately 50 percent of the net losses and loss expense reserves are paid out within two years of the date incurred. The remaining net losses and loss expense reserves, particularly those associated with the casualty lines of business, may extend to 20 years or more. For further discussion regarding net reserves for losses and loss expenses, see Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The reserve for losses and loss expenses as reported in AIG\\'s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 1994, differs from the total reserve reported in the Annual Statements filed with state insurance departments and, where appropriate, with foreign regulatory authorities. The difference at December 31, 1994 is primarily because of minor discounting on certain workers\\' compensation claims, estimates for unrecoverable reinsurance and additional reserves relating to certain foreign operations. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nThe reserve for gross losses and loss expenses is prior to reinsurance and represents the accumulation for reported losses and IBNR. Management reviews the adequacy of established gross losses reserves in the manner previously described for net losses reserves. The \"Analysis of Consolidated Gross Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development\", which follows, presents the development of gross losses and loss expense reserves for calendar years 1994, 1993 and 1992. As with the net losses and loss expense reserve development, the redundancies of $180.3 million and $332.0 million for 1993 and 1992, respectively, are relatively insignificant both in terms of an aggregate amount and as a percentage of the initial reserve balance. ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED GROSS LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT\\nLIFE INSURANCE OPERATIONS\\nAIG\\'s life insurance subsidiaries offer a wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment products. One or more of these subsidiaries is licensed to write life insurance in all states in the United States and in over 70 foreign countries. Traditional products consist of individual and group life, annuity, and accident and health policies. Financial and investment products consist of single premium annuity, variable annuities, guaranteed investment contracts and universal life. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nIn the United States, AIG has four domestic life subsidiaries: American International Life Assurance Company of New York, AIG Life Insurance Company, Delaware American Life Insurance Company, and Pacific Union Assurance Company. These companies utilize multiple distribution channels including brokerage and career and general agents to offer primarily financial and investment products and specialty forms of accident and health coverage for individuals and groups, including employee benefit plans. The domestic life business comprised 5.5 percent of total life premium income in 1994. Life insurance operations in foreign countries comprised 94.5 percent of life premium income and 95.6 percent of operating income in 1994. AIG operates overseas through four main subsidiary companies, ALICO, AIA , Nan Shan and PHILAM. Although ALICO is incorporated in Delaware, all of its business is written outside of the United States. ALICO has operations either directly or through subsidiaries in approximately 50 countries located in Europe, Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and the Far East, with Japan being the largest territory. AIA operates primarily in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. Nan Shan operates primarily in Taiwan while PHILAM in the Philippines. Traditional life insurance products such as whole life and endowment continue to be significant in the overseas companies, especially in Southeast Asia, while a mixture of traditional, accident and health and financial products are sold in Japan. In addition to the above, AIG also has subsidiary operations in Switzerland (Ticino Societa d\\'Assicurazioni Sulla Vita), Puerto Rico (AIG Life Insurance Company of Puerto Rico) and conducts life insurance business through AIUO subsidiary companies in certain countries in Central and South America. The foreign life companies have approximately 100,000 career agents and sell their products largely to indigenous persons in local currencies. In addition to the agency outlets, these companies also distribute their products through direct marketing channels, such as mass marketing, and through brokers and other distribution outlets such as financial institutions. The following table summarizes the life insurance operating results for the year ended December 31, 1994. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\n(a) Including income related to investment type products. (b) Including $160.13 billion of whole life insurance and endowments. (c) Not applicable. INSURANCE INVESTMENT OPERATIONS\\nA significant portion of AIG\\'s general and life operating revenues are derived from AIG\\'s insurance investment operations. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 1, 2, 8 and 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nThe following table is a summary of the composition of AIG\\'s insurance invested assets by insurance segment, including investment income due and accrued and real estate, at December 31, 1994:\\n(a) Includes $163,956 of bonds trading securities, at market value.

The ability to implement this policy is somewhat limited in certain territories as there may be a lack of qualified long term investments or investment restrictions may be imposed by the local regulatory authorities. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nAGENCY AND SERVICE FEE OPERATIONS\\nAIG\\'s agency and service fee operations contribute to AIG earnings through fees as agents and managers, the premiums they generate for AIG\\'s insurance companies and the revenues they produce from technical and support service activities. Several AIG companies act as managing general agents for both AIG subsidiaries and non-affiliated insurance companies, accepting liability on risks and actively managing the business produced. These general agencies deal directly with the producing agents and brokers, exercise full underwriting control, issue policies, collect premiums, arrange reinsurance, perform accounting, actuarial and safety and loss control services, adjust and pay losses and claims, and settle net balances with the represented companies. In some cases, they also maintain their own and the represented companies\\' authority to do business in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Agency and service fee operations are conducted primarily through AIG Risk Management, Inc., which provides risk management services to independent insurance agents, brokers and their customers on a worldwide basis and AIG Aviation Inc., which sells aviation insurance. FINANCIAL SERVICES OPERATIONS\\nAIG operations which contribute to financial services income include primarily A.I. Credit Corp. (\"AICCO\"), AIG Financial Products Corp. and its subsidiary companies (\"AIGFP\"), AIG Trading Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (\"AIGTG\"), International Lease Finance Corporation (\"ILFC\") and UeberseeBank AG. AICCO\\'s business is principally in premium financing. AIGFP engages in financial transactions, including long-dated interest rate and currency swaps and structures borrowings through guaranteed investment agreements. AIGTG engages in various commodities trading, foreign exchange trading and market making activities. ILFC is engaged primarily in the acquisition of new and used commercial jet aircraft and the leasing and remarketing of such aircraft to airlines around the world. UeberseeBank AG operates as a Swiss bank. Other financial services operations are AIG Global Investors, Inc. and AIG Investment Corporation and their subsidiaries, which manage the investment portfolios of various AIG subsidiaries.

ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS\\nAs of March 15, 1995, AIG holds a 46.4 percent interest in Transatlantic Holdings, Inc., a reinsurance holding company, and a 19.9 percent interest in Richmond Insurance Company, Ltd., a reinsurer. (See also Note 1(n) of Notes to Financial Statements.) During 1992, AIG acquired convertible preferred stock in The Robert Plan Corporation, a leading servicer and underwriter of private passenger and commercial automobile insurance in urban markets. During 1993, AIG acquired a 23.1 percent interest in Kroll Associates, an international investigation and consulting firm. AIG holds a 23.9 percent interest in SELIC Holdings, Ltd., an insurance holding company and a 24.4 percent interest in IPC Holding, Ltd., a reinsurance holding company. During 1994, AIG invested $200 million in non-voting convertible preferred stock of Alexander and Alexander Services, Inc., an independent insurance brokerage operation. As of March 24, 1995, AIG had invested $236 million in convertible preferred stock and warrants of 20th Century Industries, a low-cost provider of mass marketed auto insurance in California. LOCATIONS OF CERTAIN ASSETS\\nAs of December 31, 1994, approximately 37 percent of the consolidated assets of AIG were located in foreign countries (other than Canada), including $925.2 million of cash and securities on deposit with foreign regulatory authorities. Foreign operations and assets held abroad may be adversely affected by political developments in foreign countries, including such possibilities as tax changes, nationalization and changes in regulatory policy, as well as by consequence of hostilities and unrest. The risks of such occurrences and their overall effect upon AIG vary from country to country and cannot easily be predicted. If expropriation or nationalization does occur, AIG's policy is to take all appropriate measures to seek recovery of such assets. Certain of the countries in which AIG's business is conducted have currency restrictions which generally cause a delay in a company's ability to repatriate assets and profits. (See also Notes 1(t), 2 and 19(d) of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nINSURANCE REGULATION AND COMPETITION\\nCertain states require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies which are licensed in such states and are controlled by other corporations. Applicable legislation typically requires periodic disclosure concerning the corporation which controls the registered insurer and the other companies in the holding company system and prior approval of intercorporate transfers of assets (including in some instances payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiary) within the holding company system. AIG's subsidiaries are registered under such legislation in those states which have such requirements. (See also Note 10(b) of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG's insurance subsidiaries, in common with other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and by other jurisdictions in which they do business. Within the United States, the method of such regulation varies but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory and\\nsupervisory powers to an insurance official. The regulation and supervision relate primarily to approval of policy forms and rates, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, including risk based capital measurements, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on investments, restrictions on the size of risks which may be insured under a single policy, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, methods of accounting, periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies, the form and content of reports of financial condition required to be filed, and reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than security holders. (See also Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nRisk Based Capital (RBC) is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. Thus, inadequately capitalized general and life insurance companies may be identified. The RBC formula develops a risk adjusted target level of statutory surplus by applying certain factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. Higher factors are applied to more risky items and lower factors are applied to less risky items. Thus, the target level of statutory surplus varies not only as a result of the insurer's size, but also on the risk profile of the insurer's operations. The RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control. To the extent that any of AIG's insurance entities would fall below prescribed levels of surplus, it would be AIG's intention to infuse necessary capital to support that entity. These statutory surplus of each of AIG's domestic general and life insurance company subsidiaries exceeded its RBC standards by considerable margins as of December 31, 1994. A substantial portion of AIG's general insurance business and a majority of its life insurance business is carried on in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies from minimal in some to stringent in others. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification or revocation by such authorities, and AIU or other AIG subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. In the past, AIU has been allowed to modify its operations to conform with new licensing requirements in most jurisdictions. In addition to licensing requirements, AIG's foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, policy language and terms, amount and type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of local investment and the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on participating policies. Some foreign countries regulate rates in various types of policies. Certain countries have established reinsurance institutions, wholly or partially owned by the state, to which admitted insurers are obligated to cede a portion of their business on terms which do not always allow foreign insurers, including AIG, full compensation. Regulations governing constitution of technical reserves and remittance balances in some countries may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets. The insurance industry is highly competitive. Within the United States, AIG's general insurance subsidiaries compete with approximately 4,300 other stock companies, specialty insurance organizations, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations. AIG's life insurance companies compete in the United States with some 1,600 life insurance companies and other participants in related financial service fields. Overseas, AIG subsidiaries compete for business with foreign insurance operations of the larger U.S. insurers and local companies in particular areas in which they are active. AIG's financial services subsidiaries, particularly AIGTG and AIGFP, operate in a highly competitive environment both domestically and overseas. Principal sources of competition are banks, investment banks and other non-bank financial institutions.\"),\n",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\nOPERATIONAL REVIEW\\nGENERAL INSURANCE OPERATIONS\\nGeneral insurance operations for the twelve month periods ending December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992 were as follows:\\nIn AIG's general insurance operations, 1994 net premiums written and net premiums earned increased 8.4 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively, from those of 1993. In 1993, net premiums written increased 9.7 percent and net premiums earned increased 3.9 percent when compared to 1992. The growth in net premiums written in 1994 and 1993 resulted from a combination of several factors. Although AIG continued to achieve some general price increases in domestic commercial property and some specialty casualty markets, the primary reasons for this growth were price and volume increases overseas. Foreign general insurance operations produced 33.0 percent of the general insurance net premiums written in 1994, 30.1 percent in 1993 and 28.2 percent in 1992. During 1994, the U.S. dollar declined in value in relation to most major foreign currencies in which AIG transacts business. Accordingly, the translation of foreign net premiums written into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation caused the increase in total net premiums written to be approximately one and one-half percentage points greater than it would have been if translated utilizing exchange rates prevailing in 1993. If the net premiums written with respect to the domestic risk management operations were excluded from both 1994 and 1993, the domestic net premiums written would have increased approximately 12 percent. The decline in the volume of the risk management net premiums written was generally a result of higher deductibles. This decline had no impact on the operating income produced by the risk management business. Net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies. The net unearned premium reserve constitutes the deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period.\"),\n",

The statutory general insurance ratios were as follows:\\nThe Northridge earthquake which struck the Los Angeles area of California in January, 1994, resulted in gross and net incurred losses of approximately $174 million and $55 million, respectively. Although there were severe winter storms during the first quarter of 1994, AIG considered these as losses incurred in the ordinary course of business, not as catastrophes. The gross and net losses recorded in 1993 for catastrophes were approximately $134 million and $70 million, respectively. The catastrophes incurred in both 1994 and 1993 were significantly below the gross and net catastrophe losses of approximately $567 million and $192 million, respectively, recorded in 1992. Three major storms, Andrew, Iniki and Omar, occurred in 1992. If the catastrophes were excluded from the losses incurred in each period, the pro forma consolidated statutory general insurance ratios would be as follows:\\nThe maintenance of the pro forma statutory combined ratio in all three years at a level approximating 100 is a result of AIG's emphasis on maintaining its underwriting discipline within the continued overall competitiveness of the domestic market environment as well as AIG's expense control.

(See also Note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements.) The adjusted underwriting profit in 1994 was $147.5 million compared to an adjusted underwriting profit of $10.4 million recorded in 1993 and an adjusted underwriting loss of $195.1 million in 1992. (See also Note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nThe domestic adjusted underwriting loss has been impacted significantly by catastrophes in all three years. Excluding the effects of these catastrophes, the domestic general insurance operation has significantly improved over the three year period. This improvement is a result of a strategy implemented several years ago. That is, AIG withdrew from certain classes of business, primarily agency lines and certain segments of workers\\' compensation business. At that time, AIG had determined that the returns on capital or equity allocated to such classes were deemed unacceptable. AIG\\'s objective continues to be disciplined underwriting, especially in the domestic primary casualty market, and AIG does not seek net premium growth where rates do not adequately reflect its assessment of exposures. General insurance net investment income in 1994 increased 7.1 percent when compared to 1993. In 1993, net investment income increased 7.1 percent over 1992. The growth in net investment income in each of the three years was primarily attributable to new cash flow for investment. The new cash flow was generated from net general insurance operating cash flow and included the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income. (See also the discussion under \"Liquidity\" herein.)\\nGeneral insurance realized capital gains were $52.5 million in 1994, $65.3 million in 1993 and $67.1 million in 1992. These realized gains resulted from the ongoing management of the general insurance investment portfolios within the overall objectives of the general insurance operations and arose primarily from the disposition of equity securities and available for sale and trading fixed maturities as well as redemptions of fixed maturities. General insurance operating income in 1994 increased 15.5 percent when compared to 1993. The 1993 results reflect an increase of 26.0 percent from 1992. The contribution of general insurance operating income to income before income taxes and the cumulative effect of accounting changes was 55.4 percent in 1994 compared to 54.4 percent in 1993 and 52.6 percent in 1992. A year to year comparison of operating income is significantly influenced by the catastrophe losses in any one year as well as the volatility from one year to the next in realized capital gains. Adjusting each year to exclude the effects of both catastrophe losses and realized capital gains, operating income would have increased by 15.3 percent in 1994 and 13.9 percent in 1993.'),\n",

AIG is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its general insurance operations. AIG is cognizant of the need to exercise good judgment in the selection and approval of both domestic and foreign companies participating in its reinsurance programs. AIG insures risks in over 100 countries and its reinsurance programs must be coordinated in order to provide AIG the level of reinsurance protection which AIG desires. These reinsurance arrangements do not relieve AIG from its direct obligations to its insureds. AIG's general reinsurance assets amounted to $16.29 billion and resulted from its reinsurance arrangements. Thus, a credit exposure existed at December 31, 1994 with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer may not be able to reimburse AIG under the terms of these reinsurance arrangements. AIG manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound, and when necessary AIG holds substantial collateral in the form of funds, securities and/or irrevocable letters of credit. This collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods. The application of this collateral against balances due or any changes to the amount of collateral are based on the development of losses recoverable on an individual reinsurer basis. This development includes losses incurred but not reported (IBNR). Approximately 59 percent of reinsurance recoverable is from unauthorized reinsurers. In order to obtain statutory recognition, nearly all of these balances are collateralized. The remaining 41 percent of the reinsurance recoverable is from authorized reinsurers and over 90 percent of such balances are from reinsurers rated A- (excellent) or better, as rated by A.M. Best.\"),\n",

At that date, and prior to this allowance, AIG had no significant reinsurance recoverables from any individual reinsurer which is financially troubled (e.g., liquidated, insolvent, in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction). AIG's Reinsurance Security Department conducts ongoing detailed assessments of the reinsurance markets and current and potential reinsurers both foreign and domestic. Such assessments include, but are not limited to, identifying if a reinsurer is appropriately licensed, and whether a reinsurer has sufficient financial capacity. Also considered are such things as the local economic environment and exchange rates of foreign reinsurers. This department also reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for collateral. In addition, AIG's Credit Risk Committee reviews the credit limits for and concentrations with any one reinsurer.

The ceded reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate ceded losses including provisions for ceded IBNR and loss expenses. The methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting ceded reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments therefrom are reflected in income currently. It is AIG's belief that the ceded reserves at December 31, 1994 were representative of the ultimate losses recoverable. In the future, as the ceded reserves continue to develop to ultimate amounts, the ultimate loss recoverable may be greater or less than the reserves currently ceded. At December 31, 1994, general insurance reserves for losses and loss expenses (loss reserves) amounted to $31.44 billion, an increase of $1.39 billion or 4.6 percent over the prior year end. General insurance net loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including IBNR, and loss expenses, reduced by reinsurance recoverable net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance and minor amounts of discounting related to certain workers' compensation claims. The net loss reserves increased $861.9 million or 4.9 percent to $18.42 billion. The methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in operating income currently. It is management's belief that the general insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover all general insurance net losses and loss expenses as at December 31, 1994. In the future, if the general insurance net loss reserves develop deficiently, such deficiency would have an adverse impact on such future results of operations. In a very broad sense, the general loss reserves can be categorized into two distinct groups: one group being long tail casualty lines of business; the other being short tail lines of business consisting principally of property lines and including certain classes of casualty lines. Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses (net losses) for long tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the line and volume of the business involved. In the more recent accident years of long tail casualty lines there is limited statistical credibility in reported net losses. That is, a relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims and expenses and an even smaller proportion would be net losses paid. A relatively high proportion of net losses would therefore be IBNR. A variety of actuarial methods and assumptions are normally employed to estimate net losses for long tail casualty lines. These methods ordinarily involve the use of loss trend factors intended to reflect the estimated annual growth in loss costs from one accident year to the next. Loss trend factors reflect many items including changes in claims handling, exposure and policy forms and current and future estimates of monetary inflation and social inflation. Thus, many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the year to year growth in loss costs. Therefore, AIG's carried net long tail loss reserves are judgmentally set as well as tested for reasonableness using the most appropriate loss trend factors for each class of business. In the evaluation of AIG's net loss reserves, loss trend factors vary slightly, depending on the particular class and nature of the business involved. For the majority of long tail casualty lines, net loss trend factors approximating 10 percent were employed. These factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss experience. Estimation of net losses for short tail business is less complex than for long tail casualty lines. Loss cost trends for many property lines can generally be assumed to be similar to the growth in exposure of such lines. For example, if the fire insurance coverage remained proportional to the actual value of the property, the growth in property's exposure to fire loss can be approximated by the amount of insurance purchased. For other property and short tail casualty lines, the loss trend is implicitly assumed to grow at the rate that reported net losses grow from one year to the next. The concerns noted above for longer tail casualty lines with respect to the limited statistical credibility of reported net losses generally do not apply to shorter tail lines. AIG continues to receive indemnity claims asserting injuries from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites (hereinafter collectively referred to as environmental claims) and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. The vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained an absolute exclusion for pollution related damage. However, AIG currently underwrites pollution impairment liability insurance on a claims made basis and excluded such claims from the analyses included herein. AIG has established a specialized claims unit which investigates and adjusts all such asbestos and environmental claims. Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a difficult process. These asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated by conventional reserving techniques as previously described. Quantitative techniques frequently have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including managerial judgment. Significant factors which affect the trends which influence the development of asbestos and environmental claims are the inconsistent court resolutions, judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage and the increasing number of new claims. The case law that has emerged can be characterized as still being in its infancy and the likelihood of any firm direction in the near future is very\\nAmerican International Group, Inc.\"),\n",

Additionally, the exposure for cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites involves issues such as allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and the government's refusal to release parties. The cleanup cost exposure may significantly change if the Congressional reauthorization of Superfund expected in 1995 dramatically changes, thereby reducing or increasing litigation and cleanup costs. In the interim, AIG and other industry members have and will continue to litigate the broadening judicial interpretation of the policy coverage and the liability issues. At the current time, it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. Such development will be affected by the extent to which courts continue to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage, as they have in the past, as well as by changes in Superfund and waste dump site coverage issues. Additional liabilities could emerge for amounts in excess of the current reserves held. Although this emergence cannot now be reasonably estimated, it could have a material adverse impact on AIG's future operating results. The reserves carried for these claims at December 31, 1994 are believed to be adequate as these reserves are based on the known facts and current law. Furthermore, as AIG's net exposure retained relative to the gross exposure written was lower in 1984 and prior years, the potential impact of these claims is much smaller on the net loss reserves than on the gross loss reserves. (See the previous discussion on reinsurance collectibility herein.)\\nThe majority of AIG's exposures for asbestos and environmental claims are excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. Thus, the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity reserves. That is, litigation expenses are included within the limits of the liability AIG incurs.\"),\n",

Such payments include indemnity payments and legal and loss adjustment payments. It should be noted, however, that this is an extremely simplistic approach to measuring asbestos and environmental reserve levels. Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, do have significant impact on the amount of asbestos and environmental losses and loss expense reserves, ultimate payments thereof and the resultant ratio. In addition to the study published by that insurance rating agency, another published study projected significantly lower ultimate costs for toxic waste cleanups for the insurance industry. The developed survival ratios include both involuntary and voluntary indemnity payments. Involuntary payments include court judgments; court orders; covered claims with no coverage defenses; state mandated cleanup costs; claims where AIG's coverage defenses are minimal; and settlements made less than six months before the first trial setting. Also, AIG considers all legal and loss adjustment payments as involuntary. AIG believes voluntary indemnity payments should be excluded from the survival ratio. The special asbestos and environmental claims unit actively manages AIG's asbestos and environmental claims and proactively pursues early settlement of environmental claims for all known and unknown sites. As a result, AIG reduces its exposure to future environmental loss contingencies. Accordingly, AIG's survival ratios for involuntary asbestos and environmental claims, separately and combined, were estimated as follows for the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993:\\nAIG's operations are negatively impacted under guarantee fund assessment laws which exist in most states. As a result of operating in a state which has guarantee fund assessment laws, a solvent insurance company may be assessed for certain obligations arising from the insolvencies of other insurance companies which operated in that state.

AIG\\'s life premium income in 1994 represented an 17.0 percent increase from the prior year. This compares with an increase of 18.4 percent in 1993 over 1992. Foreign life operations produced 94.5 percent, 95.3 percent and 94.4 percent of the life premium income in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. (See also Notes 1, 4 and 6 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAs previously discussed, the U.S. dollar declined in value in relation to most major foreign currencies in which AIG transacts business. Accordingly, the translation of foreign life premium income into U.S. dollars for purposes of consolidation caused the increase in total premium income to be approximately two percentage points greater than it would have been if translated utilizing exchange rates prevailing in 1993. Life insurance net investment income increased 16.6 percent in 1994 compared to an increase of 14.1 percent in 1993. The growth in net investment income was primarily attributable to new cash flow for investment. The new cash flow was generated from net life insurance operating cash flow and included the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income. (See also the discussion under \"Liquidity\" herein.)\\nThe growth in the premium income of the domestic life segment resulted primarily from the risk bearing premium related to corporate-owned life insurance products. Additionally, the interest income earned on the policy loans associated with these products has significantly increased domestic investment income. The traditional life products, such as whole and term life and endowments, were the major contributors to the growth in foreign premium income and investment income, particularly in Asia, and continue to be the primary source of growth in the life segment. A mixture of traditional, accident and health and financial products are being sold in Japan. Life insurance realized capital gains were $86.7 million in 1994, $54.6 million in 1993 and $43.3 million in 1992. These realized gains resulted from the ongoing management of the life insurance investment portfolios within the overall objectives of the life insurance operations and arose primarily from the disposition of equity securities and available for sale fixed maturities and redemptions of fixed maturities. Life insurance operating income in 1994 increased 21.9 percent to $952.5 million compared to an increase of 17.1 percent in 1993. Excluding realized capital gains from life insurance operating income, the percent increases would be 19.1 percent and 16.5 percent in 1994 and 1993, respectively. The contribution of life insurance operating income to income before income taxes and the cumulative effect of accounting changes amounted to 32.3 percent in 1994 compared to 30.0 percent in 1993 and 31.2 percent in 1992. The risks associated with the traditional life and accident and health products are underwriting risk and investment risk. The risk associated with the financial and investment contract products is investment risk. Underwriting risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the actual policy experience adversely emerging in comparison to the assumptions made in the product pricing associated with mortality, morbidity, termination and expenses. AIG\\'s life companies limit their maximum underwriting exposure on traditional life insurance of a single life to approximately $1.3 million of coverage by using yearly renewable term reinsurance. The life insurance operations have not entered into assumption reinsurance transactions or surplus relief transactions during the three year period ended December 31, 1994. (See also Note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nThe investment risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the cash flows from the invested assets, primarily long-term fixed rate investments, being less than the cash flows required to meet the obligations of the expected policy and contract liabilities and the necessary return on investments. To minimize its exposure to investment risk, AIG tests the cash flows from the invested assets and the policy and contract liabilities using various interest rate scenarios to assess whether there is a liquidity excess or deficit. If a rebalancing of the invested assets to the policy and contract claims became necessary and did not occur, a demand could be placed upon liquidity. (See also the discussion under \"Liquidity\" herein.)\\nThe asset-liability relationship is appropriately managed in AIG\\'s foreign operations, even though certain territories lack qualified long-term investments or there are investment restrictions imposed by the local regulatory authorities. For example,\\nMANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\\nin Japan and several Southeast Asia territories, the duration of the investments is often for a shorter period than the effective maturity of such policy liabilities. Therefore, there is a risk that the reinvestment of the proceeds at the maturity of the investments may be at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of the policy liabilities. In Japan, the average duration of the investment portfolio is 5.0 years, while the related policy liabilities are estimated to be 11.5 years. To maintain an adequate yield to match the interest required over the duration of the liabilities, constant management focus is required to reinvest the proceeds of the maturing securities without sacrificing investment quality. To the extent permitted under local regulation, AIG may invest in qualified longer-term securities outside Japan to achieve a closer matching in both duration and the required yield. AIG is able to manage any asset-liability duration difference through maintenance of sufficient global liquidity and to support any operational shortfall through its international financial network. Domestically, the asset-liability matching process is appropriately functioning as there are investments available to match the duration and the required yield. (See also the discussion under \"Liquidity\" herein.)\\nAIG uses asset-liability matching as a management tool to determine the composition of the invested assets and marketing strategies.'),\n",

AGENCY AND SERVICE FEE OPERATIONS\\nAgency and service fee operating income in 1994 decreased 10.2 percent to $54.1 million compared to $60.2 million which was an increase of 14.6 percent in 1993. The decline in 1994 was due to reduced commission revenue in certain of AIG\\'s managing general agencies. The increase in operating income in 1993 resulted from the growth of risk management services. Agency and service fee operating income contributed 1.8 percent to AIG\\'s income before income taxes and the cumulative effect of accounting changes in 1994 compared to 2.3 percent in 1993 and 2.5 percent in 1992. FINANCIAL SERVICES OPERATIONS\\nFinancial services operations for the twelve month periods ending December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992 were as follows:\\n* Represents net trading revenues. Financial services operating income increased 3.8 percent in 1994 over 1993. This compares with an increase of 12.6 percent in 1993 over 1992. The financial services operating income in both 1994 and 1993 increased primarily as a result of the increase in the operating income of International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC). ILFC primarily engages in the acquisition of new and used commercial jet aircraft and the leasing and sale of such aircraft to airlines around the world. ILFC derives a substantial portion of its revenues from its leasing operations and is also engaged in the remarketing of commercial jets to and for airlines and financial institutions. As a result of the rising interest rate environment during 1994, ILFC\\'s new borrowings were at higher rates relative to prior years. In such an environment, ILFC negotiates higher lease rates on any new contract. The increase in interest rates had a minor impact on ILFC\\'s current lease margins. It is not anticipated that this rise in interest rates will have any significant impact on future operating income. (See also the discussions under \"Capital Resources\" and \"Liquidity\" herein.)\\nILFC is exposed to loss through non-performance of aircraft lessees, through owning aircraft which it would be unable to lease or re-lease at acceptable rates or sell at lease expiration and through committing to purchase aircraft which it would be unable to lease. ILFC manages its lessee non-performance exposure through credit reviews and security deposit requirements. At December 31, 1994, only three of 270 aircraft owned were not leased. At March 1, 1995, these three aircraft have been committed for either lease or sale and all other aircraft remain leased. Currently, 77 percent of the fleet is leased to foreign carriers producing 76.8 percent of ILFC\\'s rental revenues. (See also the discussions under \"Capital Resources\" and \"Liquidity\" herein.)\\nAIG Trading Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (AIGTG), derive a substantial portion of their revenues from market making and trading activities, as principals, in foreign exchange, interest rates, precious and base metals, petroleum and natural\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\ngas. AIGTG\\'s operating income declined as a result of reduced volatility in 1994 relative to 1993 in the markets in which AIGTG participates. (See also the discussions under \"Capital Resources,\" \"Liquidity\" and \"Derivatives\" herein.)\\nAIG Financial Products Corp. and its subsidiaries (AIGFP) participate in the derivatives dealer market conducting, as principals, an interest rate, currency and equity derivative products business which includes long-dated transactions. AIGFP also enters into guaranteed investment agreements. In 1994, AIGFP\\'s revenues and operating income were less than those of 1993 as a result of fewer transactions. Current and past performance may not provide a basis for predicting future performance. AIGFP derives substantially all its revenues from proprietary positions entered in connection with counterparty transactions rather than for speculative purposes. (See also the discussions under \"Capital Resources,\" \"Liquidity\" and \"Derivatives\" herein.)\\nFinancial services operating income represented 13.7 percent of AIG\\'s income before income taxes and the cumulative effect of accounting changes in 1994. This compares to 15.0 percent and 16.2 percent in 1993 and 1992, respectively. OTHER OPERATIONS\\nIn 1994, AIG\\'s equity in income of minority-owned insurance operations was $56.0 million compared to $39.6 million in 1993 and $27.9 million in 1992. The equity interest in insurance companies, which includes two equity operations which commenced business during 1993, represented 1.9 percent of income before income taxes and the cumulative effect of accounting changes in 1994, compared to 1.5 percent in 1993 and 1.3 percent in 1992. Other realized capital losses amounted to $52.3 million, $12.7 million and $11.3 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Minority interest represents minority shareholders\\' equity in income of certain consolidated subsidiaries. In 1994, minority interest amounted to $29.7 million. In 1993 and 1992, minority interest amounted to $26.9 million and $11.2 million, respectively. Other income (deductions)-net includes AIG\\'s equity in certain minor majority-owned subsidiaries and certain partially-owned companies, realized foreign exchange transaction gains and losses in substantially all currencies and unrealized gains and losses in hyperinflationary currencies, as well as the income and expenses of the parent holding company and other miscellaneous income and expenses. In 1994, net deductions amounted to $68.6 million. In 1993 and 1992, net deductions amounted to $46.9 million and $59.0 million, respectively. Income before income taxes and the cumulative effect of accounting changes amounted to $2.95 billion in 1994 and $2.60 billion in 1993. Income before income taxes was $2.14 billion in 1992. In 1994, AIG recorded a provision for income taxes of $776.5 million compared to the provisions of $683.0 million and $512.0 million in 1993 and 1992, respectively. These provisions represent effective tax rates of 26.3 percent in 1994 and 1993 and 24.0 percent in 1992. The most significant cause for the increase in the effective tax rate for 1993 was the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the Act). Among other things, the Act increased the corporate tax rate to 35 percent from 34 percent, effective January 1, 1993. Additionally, the 1993 effective tax rate was influenced by higher state and local income taxes. (See Note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nIncome before the cumulative effect of accounting changes amounted to $2.18 billion in 1994, $1.92 billion in 1993 and $1.63 billion in 1992. The increases in net income over the three year period resulted from those factors described above. At January 1, 1993, AIG\\'s equity in income of minority-owned insurance operations was positively impacted by the cumulative effect of accounting changes on such operations from the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 \"Accounting for Income Taxes\"(FASB 109), which was partially offset by the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 \"Employer\\'s Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pension Plans\" (FASB 106). AIG\\'s equity in the cumulative effect of such accounting changes was a net benefit of $20.7 million. AIG had adopted FASB 106 and FASB 109 effective as at January 1, 1992, recording a cumulative effect net benefit of $31.9 million. The pretax cumulative charge of adopting FASB 106 was $83.1 million and the net of tax cumulative charge was $54.8 million. The cumulative effect of adopting FASB 109 was a benefit of $86.7 million. Net income amounted to $2.18 billion in 1994, $1.94 billion in 1993 and $1.66 billion in 1992.'),\n",

Total borrowings at December 31, 1994 and 1993 were as follows:\\n* AIG does not guarantee or support these borrowings. See also Note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. GIAs serve as the primary source of proceeds for AIGFP\\'s investments in a diversified portfolio of securities and derivative transactions. During 1994, the GIA balance declined $1.2 billion. As a result, AIGFP increased its term notes payable $526.7 million to $1.05 billion as an additional source of funding for its operating activities. (See also the discussions under \"Operational Review\", \"Liquidity\" and \"Derivatives\" herein and Notes 1, 9 and 11 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG Funding, Inc. (Funding), through the issuance of commercial paper, fulfills the short-term cash requirements of AIG and its subsidiaries. Funding intends to continue to meet AIG\\'s funding requirements through the issuance of commercial paper guaranteed by AIG. This issuance of commercial paper is subject to the approval of AIG\\'s Board of Directors. ILFC, A.I. Credit Corp. (AICCO) and AIGFP issue commercial paper for the funding of their own operations. AIG does not guarantee AICCO\\'s or ILFC\\'s commercial paper. However, AIG has entered into an agreement in support of AICCO\\'s commercial paper. AIG guarantees AIGFP\\'s commercial paper. (See also the discussion under \"Derivatives\" herein and Note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nOn December 15, 1994, AIG and Funding entered into two syndicated revolving credit facilities (the Facilities) aggregating $1 billion. The Facilities consist of a $500 million 364 day revolving credit facility and a $500 million five year revolving credit facility. The Facilities represent a consolidation of domestic and international bilateral lines of credit and can be used for general corporate purposes. The Facilities also provide backup for AIG\\'s commercial paper programs administered by Funding. There are currently no borrowings outstanding under either of the Facilities, nor were any borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 1994. During 1994, ILFC increased the aggregate principal amount outstanding of its medium term and term notes to $4.95 billion at December 31, 1994, a net increase of $645.8 million. At December 31, 1994, ILFC had $1.6 billion in aggregate principal amount of debt securities registered for issuance from time to time. The cash used to purchase flight equipment is derived primarily from the proceeds of ILFC\\'s debt financing. The primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are the lease receipts received and proceeds from the sale of flight equipment. During 1994, ILFC obtained net financing of $1.76 billion for the acquisition of flight equipment costing $2.73 billion. Additional funds were provided by operating cash flow and the sale of flight equipment. ILFC sold $100 million of Market Auction Preferred Stock in 1993. Additionally, $100 million of Market Auction Preferred Stock was sold in February, 1995. The proceeds from the sale of these securities were used to reduce ILFC\\'s maturing debt.

In December 1994, the Mexican peso was devalued significantly against the U.S. dollar, as well as other currencies. AIG\\'s Mexican operations constitute only a minor part of AIG\\'s consolidated general and life operations and therefore the devaluation had little effect on AIG\\'s results of operations or financial condition. It is also anticipated that there will be little impact going forward. During 1994, AIG repurchased 2.09 million shares of its common stock in the open market at a cost of $177.7 million. During 1993, preferred stock issued and outstanding decreased $7,500 and additional paid-in capital declined approximately $150 million due to the redemption of Series M-1 and M-2 Exchangeable Money Market Cumulative Serial Preferred Stock. Common stock increased by $281.2 million and additional paid-in capital decreased by that amount as a result of a common stock split in the form of a 50 percent stock dividend paid July 30, 1993. (See also Note 10 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nPayments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by statutory authorities. AIG has in the past reinvested most of its unrestricted earnings in its operations and believes such continued reinvestment in the future will be adequate to meet any foreseeable capital needs. However, AIG may choose from time to time to raise additional funds through the issuance of additional securities. At December 31, 1994, there were no significant statutory or regulatory issues which would impair AIG\\'s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. (See also the discussion under \"Liquidity\" herein and Note 10 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nLIQUIDITY\\nAt December 31, 1994, AIG\\'s consolidated invested assets included approximately $2.54 billion of cash and short-term investments. Consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in 1994 amounted to approximately $5.39 billion. Management believes that AIG\\'s liquid assets, its net cash provided by operations, and access to the capital markets will enable it to meet any foreseeable cash requirements. AIG\\'s liquidity is primarily derived from the operating cash flows of its general and life insurance operations. The liquidity of the combined insurance operations is derived both domestically and abroad. The combined insurance pretax operating cash flow is derived from two sources, underwriting operations and investment operations. In the aggregate, AIG\\'s insurance operations generated approximately $7.9 billion in pretax cash flow during 1994. Cash flow includes periodic premium collections, including policyholders\\' contract deposits, paid loss recoveries less reinsurance premiums, losses, benefits, acquisition and operating expenses paid and investment income. Generally, there is a time lag from when premiums are collected and, when as a result of the occurrence of events specified in the policy, the losses and benefits are paid. AIG\\'s insurance investment operations generated approximately $3.1 billion in investment income cash flow during 1994. Investment income cash flow is primarily derived from interest and dividends received and includes realized capital gains. The combined insurance pretax operating cash flow coupled with the cash and short-term investments of $2.17 billion provided the insurance operations with a significant amount of liquidity. This liquidity is available to purchase high quality and diversified fixed income securities and to a lesser extent marketable equity securities and to provide mortgage loans on real estate, policy and collateral and guaranteed loans. With this liquidity coupled with proceeds of approximately $12.7 billion from the maturities, sales and redemptions of fixed income securities and from the sales of marketable equity securities, AIG purchased approximately $19.4 billion of fixed income securities and marketable equity securities during 1994. MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\\nDuring 1995, AIG expects to have approximately $1 billion of held to maturity municipal bonds redeemed for approximately $1 billion. Prior to redemption, the yield on these bonds approximates 8 percent. If these bonds were redeemed at March 1, 1995, the estimated yield on the reinvestment of the proceeds in bonds with similar characteristics would approximate 6.5 percent. AIG does not anticipate that these redemptions will have a significant effect on AIG\\'s general investment income, operations, financial condition or liquidity.

However, similar credit quality rating services are not available in all overseas locations. Thus, AIG annually reviews the credit quality of the nonrated fixed income investments, including mortgages, in its foreign portfolio. AIG applies a scale similar to that of Moody's and S&P to the rating of these securities. Coupling the ratings of this internal review with those of the independent agencies indicates that approximately 42 percent of the foreign fixed income investments were rated AAA, less than one percent were deemed below investment grade and approximately 4 percent were not rated at December 31, 1994.

The primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are the lease receipts received and proceeds from the sale of flight equipment. During 1994, ILFC obtained net financing of $1.76 billion for the acquisition of flight equipment costing $2.73 billion. Additional funds were provided by operating cash flow and the sale of flight equipment. At December 31, 1994, ILFC had committed to purchase 236 aircraft deliverable from 1995 through 2000 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $13.4 billion and had options to purchase an additional 51 aircraft deliverable through 2001 at an estimated aggregate exercisable price of $2.8 billion. As at March 15, 1995, ILFC has entered into leases, letters of intent to lease or is in various stages of negotiation for 63 of 68 aircraft to be delivered in 1995 and 54 of 168 aircraft to be delivered subsequent to 1995. ILFC will be required to find customers for any aircraft presently on order and any new aircraft to be ordered, and it must arrange financing for portions of the purchase price of such equipment. In a rising interest rate environment, ILFC negotiates higher lease rates on any new contracts. ILFC has been successful to date both in placing its new aircraft on lease or under sales contract and obtaining adequate financing. AIGFP\\'s positions are carried at market value or at estimated fair value when market prices are not readily available. These values represent assessments of the present value of expected future cash flows. The recorded values of these transactions may be less than the values that might be realized, if AIGFP were to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIGFP reduces its economic risk exposure through similarly valued offsetting transactions including swaps, trading securities, forwards and futures. AIG believes that the impact of such limited liquidity would not be significant to AIG\\'s financial condition or its overall liquidity. (See also the discussion under \"Derivatives\" herein.)\\nSecurities available for sale, at market value and securities purchased under agreements to resell are primarily purchased with the proceeds of AIGFP\\'s GIA financings and term borrowings.

Trading securities, at market value are marked to market daily and are held to meet the short-term risk management objectives of AIGFP. AIGTG acts as principal in certain foreign exchange, interest rate, precious and base metals, petroleum and natural gas trading activities. AIGTG owns inventories in the commodities in which it trades and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the use of forwards, futures and option contracts. AIGTG uses derivatives to manage the economic exposure of its various trading positions and transactions from adverse movement in interest rates, exchange rates and commodity prices. AIGTG supports its trading activities largely through trade payables, short-term borrowings and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased.

Derivatives payments may be based on interest rates and exchange rates and/or prices of certain securities, certain commodities, or financial or commodity indices. The more significant types of derivative arrangements in which AIG transacts are swaps, forwards, futures, options and related instruments. The most commonly used swaps are interest rate and currency swaps.

A futures or forward contract is a legal contract between two parties to purchase or sell at a specified future date a specified quantity of a commodity, security, currency, financial index or other instrument, at a specified price. A futures contract is traded on an exchange, while a forward contract is executed over the counter. An option contract generally provides the option purchaser with the right but not the obligation to buy or sell during a period of time or at a specified date the underlying instrument at a set price. The option writer is obligated to sell or buy the underlying item if the option purchaser chooses to exercise his right. The option writer receives a nonrefundable fee or premium paid by the option purchaser. Derivatives are generally either negotiated over the counter contracts or standardized contracts executed on an exchange. Standardized exchange traded derivatives include futures and options which can be readily bought or sold over\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nrecognized security exchanges and settled through such clearing houses. Negotiated over the counter derivatives include forwards, swaps and options. Over the counter derivatives are generally not traded like exchange traded securities. However, in the normal course of business, with the agreement of the original counterparty, these contracts may be terminated or assigned to another counterparty. Through AIGFP and AIGTG, AIG participates in the derivatives dealer market acting primarily as principal. In these derivative operations AIG structures transactions which generally permit its counterparties to enter into transactions with respect to interest and exchange rate changes, to prices of securities and to certain commodities and financial or commodity indices. All significant derivatives activities are conducted through AIGFP and AIGTG. Generally, derivatives are used by AIG's customers such as corporations, financial institutions, multinational organizations, sovereign entities, government agencies and municipalities. For example, a futures, forward or option contract can be used to protect the customers' assets or liabilities against price fluctuations. The senior management of AIG, with review by the Board of Directors, defines the policies and establishes general operating parameters for AIGFP and AIGTG. AIG's senior management has established various oversight committees to review the various financial market, operational and credit issues of AIGFP and AIGTG. The senior managements of AIGFP and AIGTG report the results of their respective operations to and review future strategies with AIG's senior management. AIG actively manages the exposures to limit the potential to loss, while maximizing the rewards afforded by these business opportunities. In doing so, AIG must manage a variety of exposures to risk including credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and legal risk. Market risk principally arises from the uncertainty that future earnings are exposed to potential changes in volatility, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices. AIG generally controls its exposure to market risk by taking offsetting positions. AIG's philosophy with respect to its financial services operations is to minimize or set limits for open or uncovered positions that are to be carried. Credit risk exposure is separately managed. (See the discussion on the management of credit risk below). AIGFP does not seek to manage the market risk of each of its individual transactions through an individual offsetting transaction. Rather, AIGFP takes a portfolio approach to the management of its market risk exposure. AIGFP values its portfolio at market value or estimated fair value when market values are not readily available. These valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows of AIGFP's transactions and may include reserves for market risk as deemed appropriate by AIGFP management. AIGFP evaluates the portfolio's discounted cash flows with reference to current market conditions, maturities within the portfolio and other relevant factors. Based upon this evaluation, AIGFP determines what, if any, offsetting transactions are necessary to reduce the market risk exposure of the portfolio. The aforementioned estimated fair values are based upon the use of valuation models. These models utilize, among other things, current interest, foreign exchange and volatility rates.\"),\n",

Additionally, AIGFP operates in major business centers overseas and is essentially open for business 24 hours a day. Thus, the market exposure and offset strategies are monitored, reviewed and coordinated around the clock. Therefore, offsetting adjustments can be made as and when necessary from any AIGFP office in the world. As part of its monitoring and controlling of its exposure to market risk, AIGFP applies various testing techniques which reflect potential market movements. These techniques vary by currency and are regularly changed to reflect factors affecting the derivatives portfolio. In addition to the daily monitoring, AIGFP\\'s senior management and local risk managers conduct a weekly review of the derivatives portfolio and existing hedges. This review includes an examination of the portfolio\\'s risk measures, such as aggregate option sensitivity to movements in market variables. AIGFP\\'s management may change these measures to reflect their judgment and evaluation of the dynamics of the markets. This management group will also determine whether additional or alternative action is required in order to manage the portfolio. AIG utilizes an outside consultant to provide the managements of AIG and AIGFP with comfort that the system produces representative values. AIGTG\\'s approach to managing market risk is to establish an appropriate offsetting position to a particular transaction or group of transactions depending upon the extent of market risk AIGTG wishes to reduce. AIGTG senior management has established positions and stop-loss limits for each line of business. AIGTG\\'s traders are required to maintain positions within these limits. These positions are monitored during the day either manually or through on-line computer systems. In addition, these positions are reviewed by AIGTG management. Reports which present each trading book\\'s position and the prior day\\'s profit and loss are reviewed by traders, head traders and AIGTG\\'s senior management. Based upon these and other reports, AIGTG\\'s senior management may determine to adjust AIGTG\\'s risk profile. AIGTG attempts to secure reliable current market prices, such as published prices or third party quotes, to value its derivatives. Where such prices are not available, AIGTG uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or\\nMANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\\nextrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions. The methodology may reflect interest and exchange rates, volatility rates and other relevant factors. A significant portion of AIGTG\\'s business is transacted in liquid markets. Certain of AIGTG\\'s derivative product exposures are evaluated using simulation techniques which consider such factors as changes in currency and commodity prices, interest rates, volatility levels and the effect of time. Though not indicative of the future, past volatile market scenarios have represented profit opportunities for AIGTG. The gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses of AIGFP and AIGTG included in the financial services assets and liabilities at December 31, 1994 were as follows:\\n(a) See also the discussion under \"Accounting Standards: Standards Adopted in 1994\" herein. (b) The net replacement value with respect to futures and forward contracts of AIGTG at December 31, 1994 was $1.87 billion. (c) The net replacement value with respect to purchased option contracts of AIGTG at December 31, 1994 was $275.1 million. The interest rate risk on securities available for sale, at market, is managed by taking offsetting positions on a security by security basis, thereby offsetting a significant portion of the unrealized appreciation or depreciation. At December 31, 1994, the unrealized gains and losses remaining after benefit of the offsets were $8.3 million and $5.6 million, respectively. AIGFP carries its derivatives at market or estimated fair value, whichever is appropriate. Because of limited liquidity of these instruments, the recorded estimated fair values of these derivatives may be different than the values that might be realized if AIGFP were to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. (See also the discussions under \"Operational Review: Financial Services\", \"Liquidity\" and \"Accounting Standards: Standards Adopted in 1994\" herein.)\\nTrading securities, at market value, and securities sold but not yet purchased are marked to market daily with the unrealized gain or loss being recognized in income at that time. These securities are held to meet the short-term risk management objectives of AIGFP. AIGTG acts as principal in certain foreign exchange, interest rate, precious and base metals, petroleum and natural gas trading activities. AIGTG owns inventories in the commodities in which it trades. These inventories are carried at market and may be substantially hedged. AIGTG uses derivatives to manage the economic exposure of its various trading positions and transactions from adverse movements in interest rates, exchange rates and commodity prices. (See also the discussions under \"Operational Review: Financial Services\" and \"Liquidity\" herein.)\\nA counterparty may default on any obligation to AIG, including a derivative contract. Credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and/or carrying trading and investment positions. Credit risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has an estimated positive fair value. To help manage this risk, the credit departments of AIGFP and AIGTG operate within the guidelines of the AIG Credit Risk Committee, which sets credit policy and limits for counterparties and provides limits for derivative transactions with counterparties having different credit ratings. In addition to credit ratings, this committee takes into account the industry and country of the counterparty. Transactions which fall outside these pre-established guidelines require the approval of the AIG Credit Risk Committee. It is also AIG\\'s policy to establish reserves for potential credit impairment when necessary. AIGFP and AIGTG determine the credit quality of each of their counterparties taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized statistical rating organizations. If it is determined that a counterparty requires credit enhancement, then one or more enhancement techniques will be used. Examples of such enhancement techniques include letters of credit, guarantees, collateral and margin agreements. The significant majority of AIGFP\\'s transactions are contracted and documented under master netting agreements that provide for set-off and close out netting in the event of default. Excluding regulated exchange transactions, AIGTG, whenever possible, enters into netting agreements with its counter-parties which are similar in effect to those discussed above. The following tables provide the notional and contractual amounts of AIGFP\\'s derivatives portfolio at December 31, 1994. The notional amounts used to express the extent of AIGFP\\'s involvement in derivatives transactions represent a standard of measurement of the volume of AIGFP\\'s swaps business.

As a result, the net replacement value represents the net sum of estimated positive fair values after the application of such agreements and collateral held. The net replacement value most closely represents the net credit risk to AIGFP or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss.

The notional amounts used to express the extent of AIGTG\\'s involvement in derivatives transactions represent a standard of measurement of the volume of AIGTG\\'s swaps business. Notional amount is not a quantification of the market or credit risks of the positions and is not necessarily recorded on the balance sheet. Notional amounts represent those amounts used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received, except for certain contracts such as currency swaps. The timing and the amount of cash flows relating to foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures and options contracts are determined by the contractual agreements. The gross replacement values presented represent the sum of the estimated fair values of all of AIGTG\\'s derivatives contracts at December 31, 1994. These values do not represent the credit risk to AIGTG. Net replacement values presented represent the net sum of estimated positive fair values after the application of legally enforceable master closeout netting agreements and collateral held.

MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\\nAt December 31, 1994, the counterparty credit quality by derivative product with respect to the net replacement value of AIGTG\\'s derivatives portfolio was as follows:\\n* Includes $140.0 million due from exchanges. At December 31, 1994, the counterparty breakdown by industry with respect to the net replacement value of AIGTG\\'s derivatives portfolio was as follows:\\nGenerally, AIG manages and operates its businesses in the currencies of the local operating environment. Thus, exchange gains or losses occur when AIG\\'s foreign currency net investment is affected by changes in the foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar from one reporting period to the next. As an end-user, AIG and its subsidiaries, including its insurance subsidiaries, use derivatives to aid in managing AIG\\'s foreign exchange translation exposure. Derivatives may also be used to minimize certain exposures with respect to AIG\\'s debt financing and insurance investment operations; to date, such activities have been minor. AIG, through its Foreign Exchange Operating Committee, evaluates its worldwide consolidated net asset or liability positions and manages AIG\\'s translation exposure to adverse movement in currency exchange rates. AIG may use forward exchange contracts and purchases options where the cost of such is reasonable and markets are liquid to reduce these exchange translation exposures. The exchange gain or loss with respect to these hedging instruments is recorded on an accrual basis as a component of the cumulative translation adjustment account in capital funds. AIG\\'s largest currency net investments have had historically stable exchange rates with respect to the U.S. dollar. Management of AIG\\'s liquidity profile is designed to ensure that even under adverse conditions AIG is able to raise funds at the most economical cost to fund maturing liabilities and capital and liquidity requirements of its subsidiaries. Sources of funds considered in meeting these objectives include guaranteed investment agreements, issuance of long and short-term debt, maturities and sales of securities available for sale, securities sold under repurchase agreements, trade payables, securities and spot commodities sold, not yet purchased, issuance of equity, and cash provided from operations. AIG\\'s strong capital position is integral to managing liquidity, as it enables AIG to raise funds in diverse markets worldwide. (See also the discussions under \"Capital Resources\" and \"Liquidity\" herein.)\\nLegal risk arises from the uncertainty of the enforceability, through legal or judicial processes, of the obligations of AIG\\'s clients and counterparties, including contractual provisions intended to reduce credit exposure by providing for the netting of mutual obligations. (See also the discussion on master netting\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nagreements above.) AIG seeks to eliminate or minimize such uncertainty through continuous consultation with internal and external legal advisors, both domestically and abroad, in order to understand the nature of legal risk, to improve documentation and to strengthen transaction structure. Over the counter derivatives are not transacted in an exchange traded environment. The futures exchanges maintain considerable financial requirements and surveillance to ensure the integrity of exchange traded futures and options. Over the counter derivatives dealers have drafted a code of conduct to provide standards for their industry. The alternative to self-regulation is federal regulation. AIG supports self-regulation and expects to adhere to promulgated standards. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS\\nIn 1989, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) adopted the \"NAIC Solvency Policing Agenda for 1990\". Included in this agenda was the development of Risk-Based Capital (RBC) requirements. RBC relates an individual insurance company\\'s statutory surplus to the risk inherent in its overall operations. AIG believes that the development of RBC standards is a positive step for the insurance industry but further believes the standards in their present form may lead to an inefficient deployment of industry capital. As experience is gained with the application of RBC standards, it is likely that adjustments to the formula will be made. Standards for the life RBC formula and a model act have been approved by regulators and were effective with the 1993 statutory financial statements. At December 31, 1994, the adjusted capital of each of AIG\\'s four domestic life companies exceeded each of their RBC standards by considerable margins. RBC standards for property and casualty insurers were finalized in principle in December 1993 and were effective with the 1994 statutory financial statements. At December 31, 1994, the adjusted capital of each of AIG\\'s domestic general companies exceeded each of their RBC standards by considerable margins. Additionally, no AIG company is on any regulatory or similar \"watch list\". In 1992, domestic life insurance companies were required for regulatory purposes to fully adopt two investment reserves, the Asset Valuation Reserve (AVR) and the Interest Maintenance Reserve (IMR). The AVR is formula based and applies to all invested assets which are subject to either credit or market risk. The IMR defers realized capital gains and losses on the sale of fixed maturities and mortgage loans. The realized gains and losses are subsequently amortized into investment income over the original term of the disposed assets. The impact of these reserves on the separately reported statutory income of certain domestic life companies was significant in 1994. However, there was no impact on AIG\\'s 1994 GAAP consolidated life insurance operating income presented herein. In July 1994, AIG acquired $200 million of 8 percent convertible preferred stock of Alexander & Alexander Services Inc. (A&A), an independent insurance brokerage operation. The preferred stock is convertible into common stock of A&A at $17 per share. Both the convertible preferred stock and the common stock are non-voting in the hands of AIG. AIG may elect in the future to exchange its non-voting common stock for up to 9.9 percent of A&A\\'s voting common stock. The dividend will be paid in-kind for the first two years; and, at A&A\\'s option, for an additional three years. In December 1994, AIG acquired $200 million in a new issue of 9 percent cumulative convertible preferred stock of 20th Century Industries (20th Century), a low-cost provider of mass marketed auto insurance in California. Dividends on the preferred stock will be paid in cash or in kind for the first three years at 20th Century\\'s option, and in cash thereafter. Additionally, AIG invested $16 million in warrants for 16 million common shares of 20th Century at a per share exercise price of $13.50. AIG expects to enter a strategic alliance with 20th Century to extend the direct marketing of personal automobile insurance to certain western states. Pursuant to its agreement with 20th Century, by March 31, 1995, AIG will invest an additional $20 million in the preferred stock of 20th Century. In January 1995, the Kobe region of Japan suffered severe damage as a result of an earthquake. The impact of the insured losses on AIG\\'s 1995 results of operations before taxes is currently estimated to be $50 million net of reinsurance.

General Insurance Operations:Premiums are earned primarily on a pro rata basis over the term of the related coverage. The reserve for unearned premiums represents the portion of net premiums written relating to the unexpired terms of coverage. Acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned. Investment income is not anticipated in the deferral of acquisition costs (see Note 4). Losses and loss expenses are charged to income as incurred. The reserve for losses and loss expenses represents the accumulation of estimates for reported losses and includes provisions for losses incurred but not reported. AIG does not discount its loss reserves, other than for very minor amounts related to certain workers' compensation claims. The methods of determining such estimates and establishing resulting reserves, including amounts relating to reserves for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance, are continually reviewed and updated. Adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in income currently. LIFE INSURANCE OPERATIONS: Premiums for traditional life insurance products are generally recognized as revenues over the premium paying period of the related policies. Benefits and expenses are provided against such revenues to recognize profits over the estimated life of the policies. Revenues for universal life and investment-type products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, administration, and surrenders during the period. Expenses include interest credited to policy account balances and benefit payments made in excess of policy account balances. Investment income reflects certain minor amounts of realized capital gains where the gains are deemed to be an inherent element in pricing certain life products in some foreign countries. Policy acquisition costs for traditional life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period of the policy. Deferred policy acquisition costs and policy initiation costs related to universal life and investment-type products are amortized in relation to expected gross profits over the life of the policies (see Note 4). The liabilities for future policy benefits and policyholders' contract deposits are established using assumptions described in Note 6. FINANCIAL SERVICES OPERATIONS: AIG conducts, primarily as principal, an interest rate, currency, and equity derivative products business which includes long-dated transactions. AIG also enters into guaranteed investment agreement transactions. In the course of conducting this business, AIG also engages in a variety of other related financial transactions, including offsetting transactions. AIG, as principal, engages in certain foreign exchange, interest rates, precious and base metals, petroleum and natural gas trading activities. AIG owns inventories in the commodities in which it trades and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the use of forwards, futures and option contracts. AIG, as lessor, leases flight equipment principally under operating leases. Accordingly, income is reported over the life of the lease as rentals become receivable under the provisions of the lease or, in the case of leases with varying payments, under the straight-line method over the noncancelable term of the lease. In certain cases, leases provide for additional amounts contingent on usage. AIG also is a marketer of flight equipment and marketing revenues from such operations consisting of net gains on sales of flight equipment, commissions and net gains on dispositions of leased flight equipment. (c) INVESTMENTS IN FIXED MATURITIES AND EQUITY SECURITIES: Bonds and preferred stocks held to maturity, both of which are principally owned by the insurance subsidiaries, are carried at amortized cost where AIG has the ability and positive intent to hold these securities until maturity. Where AIG may not have the positive intent to hold these securities until maturity, those bonds are considered to be available for sale and carried at market value. Included in the bonds available for sale are collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). Premiums and discounts arising from the purchase of CMOs are treated as yield adjustments over the estimated life. Bond trading securities are carried at market value, as it is AIG's intention to sell these securities in the near term. Common and non-redeemable preferred stocks are carried at market value. Unrealized gains and losses from investments in equity securities and fixed maturities available for sale are reflected in capital funds, net of any related deferred income taxes. Unrealized gains and losses from investments in trading securities are reflected in income currently. Realized capital gains and losses are determined principally by specific identification. Where declines in values of securities below cost or amortized cost are considered to be other than temporary, a charge would be reflected in income for the difference between amortized cost and estimated net realizable value. (d) MORTGAGE LOANS ON REAL ESTATE, POLICY AND COLLATERAL LOANS--NET: Mortgage loans on real estate, policy loans and collateral loans are carried at unpaid principal balances. Impairment of mortgage loans on real estate and collateral loans is generally measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate subject to the fair value of underlying collateral. Interest income on such loans is recognized as cash is received. (e) FLIGHT EQUIPMENT: Flight equipment is stated at cost. Major additions and modifications are capitalized. Normal maintenance and repairs, airframe and engine overhauls and compliance\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\\nwith return conditions of flight equipment on lease are provided by and paid for by the lessee. Under the provisions of most leases for certain airframe and engine overhauls, the lessee is reimbursed for costs incurred up to but not exceeding contingent rentals paid to AIG by the lessee. AIG provides a charge to income for such reimbursements based upon the hours utilized during the period and the expected reimbursement during the life of the lease. Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line basis to a residual value of approximately 15 percent over the estimated useful lives of the related assets but not exceeding 25 years. This caption also includes deposits for aircraft to be purchased. At the time the assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the related accounts and the difference, net of proceeds, is recorded as a gain or loss. (f) SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, AT MARKET VALUE: These securities are held to meet long term investment objectives and are accounted for as available for sale, carried at market value and are recorded on a trade date basis. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in capital funds, net of any related deferred income taxes. (g) TRADING SECURITIES, AT MARKET VALUE: Trading securities are held to meet short term investment objectives, including hedging securities. These securities are recorded on a trade date basis and marked to market daily. The unrealized gains and losses are reflected in income daily.

Estimated fair values are based on the use of valuation models that utilize, among other things, current interest, foreign exchange and volatility rates with the resulting unrealized gains or losses reflected in income currently. These valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows of these transactions and may include reserves for market risk as deemed appropriate. The portfolio's discounted cash flows are evaluated with reference to current market conditions, maturities within the portfolio and other relevant factors. Based upon this evaluation, it is determined what, if any, offsetting transactions are necessary to reduce the market risk of the portfolio. The recorded values of these transactions may be different than the values that might be realized if AIG were to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIG manages its market risk with a variety of transactions, including swaps, trading securities, futures and forward contracts and other transactions as appropriate. (j) TRADE RECEIVABLES AND TRADE PAYABLES: Trade receivables and trade payables include balances due from and due to clearing brokers and exchanges and receivables from and payables to counterparties which relate to unrealized gains and losses on open futures and forward contracts, securities, commodities and swaps.

Generally, it is AIG's policy to take possession of securities purchased under agreements to resell. AIG minimizes the credit risk that counterparties to transactions might be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations by monitoring customer credit exposure and collateral value and generally requiring additional collateral to be deposited with AIG when deemed necessary. (l) OTHER INVESTED ASSETS: Other invested assets consist primarily of investments in joint ventures and partnerships and other investments not classified elsewhere herein.

Under FASB 52, functional currency assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars generally using current rates of exchange and the related translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of capital funds net of any related taxes. Functional currencies are generally the currencies of the local operating environment. Income statement accounts expressed in functional currencies are translated using average exchange rates. The adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign entities operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in income.

The effect of all other common stock equivalents is not significant for any period presented. (w) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS:\\n(i) STANDARDS ADOPTED IN 1994: In March 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 39 \"Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts\" (Interpretation), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993. The Interpretation requires that unrealized gains and losses on swaps, forwards, options and similar contracts be recognized as assets and liabilities. Previously, AIG\\'s policy was to record such unrealized gains and losses on a net basis in the consolidated balance sheet. The Interpretation allows the netting of such unrealized gains and losses with the same counterparty when they are included under a master netting arrangement with the counterparty and the contracts are reported at market value. Although there was no effect on AIG\\'s operating income upon the adoption of the Interpretation, AIG now presents certain of its financial services assets and liabilities, primarily unrealized gain or loss on interest rate and currency swaps, options and forward transactions, on a gross basis. Thus, both consolidated assets and liabilities have increased. The effect of presenting these assets and liabilities on a gross basis on AIG\\'s consolidated balance sheet was not significant. Prior years\\' balance sheets are not required to be restated. AIG adopted this interpretation effective January 1, 1994. In November 1992, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112 \"Employers\\' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits\" (FASB 112). FASB 112 establishes accounting standards for employers who provide benefits to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement. FASB 112 was adopted by AIG effective January 1, 1994 and had no significant impact on AIG\\'s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In May 1993, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114 \"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan\" (FASB 114). FASB 114 addresses the accounting by all creditors for impairment of certain loans. The impaired loans are to be measured at the present value of all expected future cash flows. The present value may be determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the loan\\'s effective rate or valued at the loan\\'s observable market price or valued at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.

FASB 118 amends FASB 114 to allow a creditor to use existing methods to recognize interest income on an impaired loan. FASB 118 also amends certain disclosure requirements of FASB 114. AIG has adopted FASB 114 and FASB 118 effective December 31, 1994. The adoption of these statements did not have any significant impact on AIG\\'s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In October 1994, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 119 \"Disclosure about Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments\" (FASB 119). FASB 119 requires disclosure about derivative financial instruments and amends FASB 105 \"Disclosure of Information about Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk and Financial Instruments with Concentrations of Credit Risk\" (FASB 105) and FASB 107 \"Disclosure about Fair Value of Financial Instruments\". FASB 119 requires disclosure about the amounts, nature and terms of derivatives that are not subject to FASB 105. Also, FASB 119 requires disclosure about financial instruments held or issued for trading purposes and purposes other than trading. This statement was adopted by AIG effective December 31, 1994. In December 1994, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) issued Statement of Position 94-5 \"Disclosure of Certain Matters in the Financial Statements of Insurance Enterprises\" (SOP 94-5). Pursuant to SOP 94-5, AIG has disclosed certain information with respect to unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses; accounting methods used by AIG\\'s insurance subsidiaries that are permitted by various domestic and foreign insurance regulatory authorities rather than prescribed by such authorities; and AIG\\'s policies and methodologies for estimating the liability for unpaid claim adjustment expense for difficult-to-estimate liabilities. (ii) STANDARDS ADOPTED PRIOR TO 1994: In 1990, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 \"Employers\\' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions\" (FASB 106). FASB 106 establishes accounting for postretirement benefits, principally postretirement health care and life insurance benefits. It requires accrual accounting for postretirement benefits during the years that an employee renders services. FASB 106 has been adopted effective January 1, 1992. The consolidated transition liability was approximately $83.1 million, including minor amounts for certain foreign plans. The transition liability was recognized immediately at adoption as a change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect of the adoption of FASB 106 was a charge of $54.8 million, net of a tax benefit of $28.3 million. In 1992, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 \"Accounting for Income Taxes\" (FASB 109). FASB 109\\'s objectives are to recognize (a) the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and (b) deferred tax liabilities and assets for expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of a deferred tax asset is subject to the expectation of future realization. AIG adopted FASB 109, effective January 1, 1992. The cumulative effect of adopting FASB 109 was a benefit of $86.7 million. At January 1, 1993, AIG adopted Statement of Accounting Standards No. 113 \"Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts\" (FASB 113). This statement specifies the accounting for the reinsuring (ceding) of insurance contracts and, effective in the first quarter of 1993, eliminates the reporting of assets and liabilities net of the effects of reinsurance. As required by FASB 113, the reserve for losses and loss expenses, reserve for unearned premiums and future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts have been presented gross of ceded reinsurance. A reinsurance asset was established to include the aforementioned ceded reinsurance balances. FASB 113 also establishes the conditions required for a contract with a reinsurer to be accounted for as reinsurance ceded and prescribes accounting and reporting standards for the contract. There has been no material effect on AIG\\'s general or life insurance operating income as a result of the adoption of FASB 113. In May 1993, FASB issued Statement of Accounting Standards No. 115 \"Accounting for Certain Investments on Debt and Equity Securities\" (FASB 115) and AIG adopted this standard at December 31, 1993. The pretax increase in carrying value of bonds available for sale as a result of marking to market was $919.3 million. The portion which inured to the benefit of policyholders was $511.8 million, which has been recorded as a component of future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts. Thus, the unrealized appreciation of investments increased $251.0 million, net of taxes of $156.5 million. FASB 115 addresses the accounting and reporting for investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values and for all investments in debt securities. Those investments are to be classified in three categories and accounted for as follows:\\n* Where an enterprise has the positive intent and ability to hold debt securities to maturity, those securities are deemed to be held to maturity securities and reported at amortized cost. * Where an enterprise purchases debt and equity securities principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term, those securities are deemed to be trading securities and are reported at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses included in operating income. * Where debt and equity securities are not reported either as held to maturity securities or trading securities, those securities are deemed to be available for sale securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from operating income and reported in a separate component of shareholders\\' equity.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\\nThis statement has significantly changed and narrowed the meaning of the held to maturity category from previous generally accepted accounting principles. During 1993, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) of the FASB adopted an accounting rule \"Accounting for Multiple-Year Retrospectively Rated Contract by Ceding and Assuming Enterprises\" (EITF Issue No. 93-6). This rule encompasses any multiyear retrospectively rated contract requiring that insurers recognize as assets the reinsurer\\'s obligations, and that ceding insurers accrue liabilities for the contract obligations.

Certain countries have restrictions on the conversions of funds which generally cause a delay in the outward remittance of such funds. Approximately 37 percent and 36 percent of consolidated assets at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively, and 52 percent, 50 percent and 47 percent of revenues for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, were located in or derived from foreign countries (other than Canada).\"),\n",

The cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of AIG's foreign subsidiaries currently not subject to U.S. income taxes was approximately $2.6 billion at December 31, 1994. Management presently has no intention of subjecting these accumulated earnings to material U.S. income taxes and no provision has been made in the accompanying financial statements for such taxes. Income taxes paid in 1994, 1993 and 1992 amounted to $741,900,000, $466,600,000 and $328,900,000, respectively. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the 1993 Act) increased the highest tax rate on corporations to 35 percent for 1993 and subsequent years. The 1993 Act requires securities dealers to recognize for tax purposes the mark-to-market gain or loss on certain securities. The adjustment from this change in accounting method must be phased into taxable income over five years beginning in 1993. The 1993 Act also disallows several items as expenses beginning in 1994. None of these items will have a significant effect on AIG's net income or financial condition. However, it is expected that income taxes paid will increase as a result of such changes. The Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Agreements Act (GATT) contains several revenue raising provisions. One of GATT's funding measures requires AIG to include Subpart F income from foreign subsidiaries in estimated tax payments. It is anticipated that the timing of income taxes paid will accelerate as a result of this change. During 1994, the Internal Revenue Service issued Treasury Regulations that affect the tax accounting method for companies which enter into hedging transactions. The expected effect of these Regulations is to accelerate the timing of AIG's income tax payments. None of these 1994 changes will have a material effect on AIG's net income.

Actual tax expense on income differs from the \"expected\" amount computed by applying the Federal income tax rate because of the following:\\n* Including U.S. tax on foreign income. (c) The components of the net deferred tax liability as of December 31, 1994 and December 31, 1993 were as follows:\\n4. DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS\\nThe following reflects the policy acquisition costs deferred for amortization against future income and the related amortization charged to income for general and life insurance operations, excluding certain amounts deferred and amortized in the same period:\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\n5. REINSURANCE\\nIn the ordinary course of business, AIG\\'s general and life insurance companies cede reinsurance to other insurance companies in order to provide greater diversification of AIG\\'s business and limit the potential for losses arising from large risks. General reinsurance is effected under reinsurance treaties and by negotiation on individual risks. Certain of these reinsurance arrangements consist of excess of loss contracts which protect AIG against losses over stipulated amounts. Amounts recoverable from general reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claims liabilities associated with the reinsurance and presented as a component of reinsurance assets. AIG life companies limit exposure to loss on any single life. For ordinary insurance, AIG retains a maximum of approximately $1,300,000 of coverage per individual life. There are smaller retentions for other lines of business. Life reinsurance is effected principally under yearly renewable term treaties. Amounts recoverable from life reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the assumptions used for the underlying policy benefits and are presented as a component of reinsurance assets. General insurance premiums written and earned were comprised of the following:\\nIn the normal course of their operations, certain AIG subsidiaries are provided reinsurance coverages from AIG\\'s minority-owned reinsurance companies. During 1994, 1993 and 1992, the premiums written which were ceded to Transatlantic amounted to $200,000,000, $238,100,000 and $210,700,000, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, reinsurance recoveries, which reduced loss and loss expenses incurred, amounted to $4.84 billion, $4.45 billion and $4.19 billion, respectively. Life insurance net premium income was comprised of the following:\\nLife insurance recoveries, which reduced death and other benefits, approximated $96.0 million, $76.7 million and $64.8 million, respectively, for each of the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992. AIG\\'s reinsurance arrangements do not relieve AIG from its direct obligation to its insureds. Thus, a credit exposure exists with respect to both general and life reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations assumed under the reinsurance agreements. AIG holds substantial collateral as security under related reinsurance agreements in the form of funds, securities and/or letters of credit. A provision has been recorded for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance. AIG has been largely successful in prior recovery efforts. AIG evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers through an internal reinsurance security committee consisting of members of AIG\\'s Senior Management. No single reinsurer is a material reinsurer to AIG nor is AIG\\'s business substantially dependent upon any reinsurance contract. Life insurance ceded to other insurance companies was as follows:\\n* The principal reason for the increase in 1994 relates to life insurance in-force ceded with respect to corporate-owned life insurance. Life insurance assumed represented 0.1 percent of gross life insurance in-force at December 31, 1994, and 0.5 percent for 1993 and 1.7 percent for 1992, and 0.1 percent, 0.1 percent and 0.2 percent of gross premium income for each of the periods ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Short duration contract liabilities are primarily accident and health products. These long duration products generally have fixed cash values and there are no surrender charges. The liability for future life policy benefits has been established based upon the following assumptions:\\n(i) Interest rates (exclusive of immediate/terminal funding annuities), which vary by territory, year of issuance and products, range from 3.0 percent to 12.0 percent within the first 20 years. Interest rates on immediate/terminal funding annuities are at a maximum of 12.2 percent and grade to not greater than 7.5 percent.

(iii) The portion of net income and unrealized appreciation of investments that can inure to the benefit of AIG is limited in some cases by the insurance contracts and by the local insurance regulations of the countries in which the policies are in force. All net income and unrealized appreciation of investments in excess of these limits have been included in the reserve for future policy benefits in the consolidated balance sheet. (iv) Participating life business represented approximately 27 percent of the gross insurance in-force at December 31, 1994 and 48 percent of gross premium income in 1994. The amount of dividends to be paid is determined annually by the Boards of Directors. Anticipated dividends are considered as a planned contractual benefit in computing the value of future policy benefits and are provided ratably over the premium-paying period of the contracts. (d) The liability for policyholders' contract deposits has been established based on the following assumptions:\\n(i) Interest rates credited on deferred annuities vary by year of issuance and range from 8.2 percent to 4.0 percent. Credited interest rate guarantees are generally for a period of one year. Withdrawal charges generally range from 6.0 percent to 10.0 percent grading to 0 percent over a period of 7 to 10 years. (ii) Domestically, GICs have market value withdrawal provisions for any funds withdrawn other than benefit responsive payments. Interest rates credited generally range from 4.7 percent to 9.1 percent and maturities range from 2 to 7 years. Overseas, primarily in the United Kingdom, GIC type contracts are credited at rates ranging from 4.5 percent to 7.0 percent with maturities generally being one year. Contracts in other foreign locations have interest rates, maturities and withdrawal charges based upon local economic and regulatory conditions. (iii) Interest rates on corporate-owned life insurance business are guaranteed at 4 percent and credited on average 9.7 percent on funds supported by policy loans. (iv) The universal life funds have credited interest rates of 6 percent to 7 percent and guarantees ranging from 4 percent to 5.5 percent depending on the year of issue. Additionally, universal life funds are subject to surrender charges that amount to 7.5 percent of the fund balance and grade off over no more than 15 years from issue. (e) Experience adjustments, relating to future policy benefits and policyholders' contract deposits, vary according to the type of contract and the territory in which the policy is in force. In general terms, investments, mortality and morbidity results may be passed through by experience credits or as an adjustment to the premium mechanism, subject to local regulatory guidance.

INVESTMENT INFORMATION (continued)\\n(e) CMOs: CMOs, held by AIG's life companies, are presented as a component of bonds available for sale, at market. The CMOs are principally U.S. government and government agency backed and AAA rated securities. These represent 86 percent of the CMOs held. Whole loans represent 14 percent of the CMOs held and are investment grade. At December 31, 1994 and 1993, the market value of the CMO portfolio was $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively; the amortized cost was approximately $1.8 billion in 1994 and $1.7 billion in 1993. AIG's CMO portfolio is readily marketable. There were no derivative (high risk) CMO securities contained in this portfolio at December 31, 1994. The distribution of the CMOs at December 31, 1994 and 1993 was as follows:\\nAt December 31, 1994, the gross weighted average coupon of this portfolio was 7.6 percent. The gross weighted average life of this portfolio was 7.8 years. (f) FIXED MATURITIES BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE: At December 31, 1994, the fixed maturities and securities available for sale held by AIG that were below investment grade were insignificant. (g) During 1993, certain investments held by AIGFP experienced financial difficulties and suffered rating downgrades. The pretax impact on AIG of the estimated other than temporary impairment in value of these investments was $215 million. As is AIG's policy in such situations where credit ratings have deteriorated significantly, these impairments have been appropriately recognized by charges to income of $104 million in 1993 and $111 million prior to 1993. (h) At December 31, 1994, non-income producing invested assets were insignificant. 9. DEBT OUTSTANDING\\nAt December 31, 1994, AIG had the following debt outstanding:\\n* AIG does not guarantee or support these borrowings. (a) COMMERCIAL PAPER: At December 31, 1994, the commercial paper issued and outstanding was as follows:\\nCommercial paper issued by Funding is guaranteed by AIG. AIG has entered into an agreement in support of AICCO's commercial paper. AIG does not guarantee ILFC's commercial paper. (b) BORROWINGS UNDER OBLIGATIONS OF GUARANTEED INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS: Borrowings under obligations of guaranteed investment agreements, which are guaranteed by AIG, are recorded on the basis of proceeds received. Obligations may be called at various times prior to maturity at the option of the counterparty. Interest rates on these borrowings range from 3.3 percent to 10.6 percent. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\\n9. DEBT OUTSTANDING (continued)\\nPayments due under these investment agreements in each of the next five years ending December 31, and the periods thereafter based on the earliest call dates, were as follows:\\nAt December 31, 1994, the market value of securities pledged as collateral with respect to these obligations approximated $1,057,319,000. (c) MEDIUM TERM NOTES PAYABLE:\\n(i) MEDIUM TERM NOTES PAYABLE ISSUED BY AIG: AIG's Medium Term Notes are unsecured obligations which may not be redeemed by AIG prior to maturity and bear interest at either fixed rates set by AIG at issuance or variable rates determined by reference to an interest rate or other formula. An analysis of the Medium Term Notes for the year ended December 31, 1994 was as follows:\\nThe interest rates on this debt range up to 8.45 percent. To the extent deemed appropriate, AIG may enter into swap transactions to reduce its effective short-term borrowing rate. At December 31, 1994, the maturity schedule for AIG's outstanding Medium Term Notes was as follows:\\nAt December 31, 1994, AIG had $247,000,000 principal amount of Series D Medium Term Notes registered and available for issuance from time to time. (ii) MEDIUM TERM NOTES PAYABLE ISSUED BY ILFC: ILFC's Medium Term Notes are unsecured obligations which may not be redeemed by ILFC prior to maturity and bear interest at fixed rates set by ILFC at issuance. As of December 31, 1994, notes in aggregate principal amount of $1,999,535,000 were outstanding with maturity dates varying from 1995 to 2004 at interest rates ranging from 3.75 percent to 9.88 percent. These notes provide for a single principal payment at the maturity of each note. At December 31, 1994, the maturity schedule for ILFC's outstanding Medium Term Notes was as follows:\\n(d) NOTES AND BONDS PAYABLE:\\n(i) ZERO COUPON NOTES: On October 1, 1984, AIG issued Eurodollar zero coupon notes in the aggregate principal amount at stated maturity of $750,000,000. The notes were offered at 12 percent of principal amount at stated maturity, bear no interest and are due August 15, 2004. The net proceeds to AIG from the issuance were $85,625,000. The notes are redeemable at any time in whole or in part at the option of AIG at 100 percent of their principal amount at stated maturity. The notes are also redeemable at the option of AIG or bearer notes may be redeemed at the option of the holder in the event of certain changes involving taxation in the United States at prices ranging from 34.41 percent currently, to 89.88 percent after August 15, 2003, of the principal amount at stated maturity together with accrued amortization of original issue discount from the preceding August 15. During 1994 and 1993, no notes were repurchased. At December 31, 1994, the notes outstanding have a face value of $189,200,000, an unamortized discount of $123,369,000 and a net book value of $65,831,000. The amortization of the original issue discount is recorded as interest expense. (ii) ITALIAN LIRE BONDS: In December, 1991, AIG issued unsecured bonds denominated in Italian Lire. The principal amount of 200 billion Italian Lire Bonds matures December 4, 2001 and accrues interest at a rate of 11.7 percent which is paid annually. These bonds are not redeemable prior to maturity, except in the event of certain changes involving taxation in the United States or the imposition of certain certification, identification or reporting requirements. Simultaneous with the issuance of this debt, AIG entered into a swap transaction which effectively converted AIG's net interest expense to a U.S. dollar liability of approximately 7.9 percent, which requires the payment of proceeds at maturity of approximately $159 million in exchange for 200 billion Italian Lire and interest thereon.

(b) AIG parent depends on its subsidiaries for cash flow in the form of loans, advances and dividends. Some AIG subsidiaries, namely those in the insurance business, are subject to regulatory restrictions on the amount of dividends which can be remitted to AIG parent. These restrictions vary by state. For example, unless permitted by the New York Superintendent of Insurance, general insurance companies domiciled in New York may not pay dividends to shareholders which in any twelve month period exceed the lesser of 10 percent of the company\\'s statutory policyholders\\' surplus or 100 percent of its \"adjusted net investment income\", as defined. Generally, less severe restrictions applicable to both general and life insurance companies exist in most of the other states in which AIG\\'s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled. Certain foreign jurisdictions have restrictions which generally cause only a temporary delay in the remittance of dividends. There are also various local restrictions limiting cash loans and advances to AIG by its subsidiaries. Largely as a result of the restrictions, approximately 64 percent of consolidated capital funds were restricted from immediate transfer to AIG parent at December 31, 1994. (c) The common stock activity for the three years ended December 31, 1994 was as follows:\\n* Shares issued to AIG and subsidiaries as part of stock split effected as dividend. Common stock increased and additional paid-in capital decreased $281.2 million as a result of a common stock split in the form of a 50 percent stock dividend paid July 30, 1993 to holders of record July 2, 1993.

In addition, AIG guarantees various obligations of certain subsidiaries. (a) Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend subject to certain conditions. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses and typically require payment of a fee. At December 31, 1994 and 1993, these commitments, made principally by AIG Capital Corp., approximated $133,000,000 and $140,700,000 respectively. AIG uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. AIG evaluates each counterparty's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by AIG upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. (b) AIG and certain of its subsidiaries become parties to financial instruments with market risk resulting from both dealer and end user activities and to reduce currency, interest rate, equity and commodity exposures. To the extent those instruments are carried at their estimated fair value, the elements of currency, interest rate, equity and commodity risks are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. In addition, these instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk not explicitly recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. Collateral is required, at the discretion of AIG, on certain transactions based on the creditworthiness of the counterparty. (c) AIGFP becomes party to off-balance sheet financial instruments in the normal course of its business and to reduce its currency, interest rate, equity and commodity exposures. AIGFP, as principal and for its own account, enters into interest rate, currency, equity and commodity swaps and swaptions. Interest rate swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. AIGFP typically becomes a principal in the exchange of interest payments between the parties and, therefore, may be exposed to loss, if counterparties default. Currency, equity and commodity swaps are similar to interest rate swaps, but may involve the exchange of principal amounts at the beginning and end of the transaction. At December 31, 1994, the notional principal amount of the sum of the swap pays and receives approximated $133.7 billion, primarily related to interest rate swaps of approximately $105.6 billion. The following tables provide the notional and contractual amounts of AIGFP's derivatives portfolio at December 31, 1994. The notional amounts used to express the extent of AIGFP's involvement in derivatives transactions represent a standard of measurement of the volume of AIGFP's swaps business. Notional amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and it may not necessarily be recorded on the balance sheet. Notional amounts represent those amounts used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received, except for certain contracts such as currency swaps. The timing and the amount of cash flows relating to foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures and options contracts are determined by the contractual agreements. The following table presents AIGFP's swaps and swaptions portfolio by maturity and type of derivative at December 31, 1994:\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\n11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (continued)\\nFutures and forward contracts are contracts for delivery of foreign currencies, commodities or financial indices in which the seller/purchaser agrees to make/take delivery at a specified future date of a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield. Risks arise as a result of movements in current market prices from contracted prices and the potential inability of counterparties to meet their obligations under the contracts. At December 31, 1994, the contractual amount of AIGFP's futures and forward contracts approximated $15.2 billion. The following table presents AIGFP's futures and forward contracts portfolio, by maturity and type of derivative at December 31, 1994:\\n* Exchange traded futures are not deemed to have significant credit exposure as the exchanges guarantee that every contract will be properly settled. AIGFP extensively uses legally enforceable master closeout netting agreements. Thus, contracts subject to such arrangements permit AIGFP to offset its receivables from and payables to the same counterparty. As a result, the net replacement value represents the net sum of estimated positive fair values after the application of such agreements and collateral held. The net replacement value most closely represents the net credit risk to AIGFP or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss. The net replacement value of all interest rate, currency, and equity/commodity swaps and swaptions at December 31, 1994, approximated $4.6 billion. The net replacement value for futures and forward contracts at December 31, 1994, approximated $31.4 million. AIGFP independently evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties, taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized statistical rating organizations. In addition, AIGFP's credit approval process involves pre-set counterparty, country and industry credit exposure limits and, for particularly credit intensive transactions, obtaining approval from AIG's Credit Risk Committee. The average credit rating of AIGFP's counterparties as a whole (as measured by AIGFP) is equivalent to AA. The maximum potential loss will increase or decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions. At December 31, 1994, the counterparty credit quality by derivative product with respect to the net replacement value of AIGFP's derivatives portfolio was as follows:\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\\n11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (continued)\\nAt December 31, 1994, the counterparty breakdown by industry with respect to the net replacement value of AIGFP's derivatives portfolio was as follows:\\nAIGFP has entered into commitments to provide liquidity for certain insured variable rate bonds issued by municipal entities. The bond agreements allow the holders, in certain circumstances, to tender the bonds to the issuer at par value. In the event a remarketing agent of an issuer is unable to resell such bonds, AIGFP would be obligated to purchase the bonds at par value. AIGFP would receive interest on any bonds purchased at rates above the then prevailing market rates. These liquidity facilities aggregate $436 million and extend through December 31, 1997. Additional commitments to provide liquidity for bonds not yet issued by municipal entities aggregated $1.3 billion at December 31, 1994. It is management's intention, as with existing obligations, to remove itself from this risk through bank participations before the issuance of the underlying bonds. Therefore, in management's opinion, it is unlikely that AIGFP will become obligated to purchase any bonds pursuant to the liquidity facilities. Securities sold, but not yet purchased represent obligations of AIGFP to deliver specified securities at their contracted prices, and thereby create a liability to repurchase the securities in the market at prevailing prices. AIGFP monitors and controls its risk exposure on a daily basis through financial and credit reporting systems and, accordingly, believes that it has in place effective procedures for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which it is subject. Management is not aware of any potential counterparty defaults as of December 31, 1994. The net trading revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 1994 from AIGFP's operations were $279.1 million. (d) AIG Trading Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (AIGTG) becomes party to off-balance sheet financial instruments in the normal course of its business and to reduce its currency, interest rate and commodity exposures. The following table provides the notional and contractual amounts of AIGTG's derivatives portfolio at December 31, 1994. In addition, the estimated positive fair values associated with the derivatives portfolio are also provided and include a maturity profile for the December 31, 1994 balances based upon the expected timing of the future cash flows. The notional amounts used to express the extent of AIGTG's involvement in derivatives transactions represent a standard of measurement of the volume of AIGTG's swaps business. Notional amount is not a quantification of the market or credit risks of the positions and is not necessarily recorded on the balance sheet. Notional amounts represent those amounts used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received, except for certain contracts such as currency swaps.

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\n11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (continued)\\nAt December 31, 1994 the counterparty breakdown by industry with respect to the net replacement value of AIGTG's derivatives portfolio was as follows:\\nAIGTG limits its risks by holding offsetting positions. In addition, AIGTG monitors and controls its risk exposures through various monitoring systems which evaluate AIGTG's market and credit risks, and through credit approvals and limits. At December 31, 1994, AIGTG did not have a significant concentration of credit risk from either an individual counterparty or group of counterparties. The net trading revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 1994 from AIGTG's operations were $246.6 million. At December 31, 1994, AIGTG had issued and outstanding $142 million principal amount of letters of credit. These letters of credit were issued primarily to various exchanges. AIG has issued unconditional guarantees with respect to the prompt payment, when due, of all present and future obligations and liabilities of AIGFP and AIGTG arising from transactions entered into by AIGFP and AIGTG. (e) At December 31, 1994, ILFC had committed to purchase 236 aircraft deliverable from 1995 through 2000 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $13.4 billion. Concurrently, at December 31, 1994, ILFC had options to purchase 51 aircraft deliverable through 2001 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $2.8 billion. ILFC will be required to find customers for any new aircraft ordered and arrange financing for portions of the purchase price of such equipment. AIG does not anticipate any losses in connection with the aforementioned activities that would have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations. (f) AIG and its subsidiaries, in common with the insurance industry in general, are subject to litigation, including claims for punitive damages, in the normal course of their business. AIG does not believe that such litigation will have a material effect on its operating results and financial condition. AIG continues to receive indemnity claims asserting injuries from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites (hereinafter collectively referred to as environmental claims) and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a difficult process, as these claims, which emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years, cannot be estimated by conventional reserving techniques. Asbestos and environmental claims development is affected by factors such as inconsistent court resolutions, the broadening of the intent of policies and scope of coverage and increasing number of new claims. AIG and other industry members have and will continue to litigate the broadening judicial interpretation of policy coverage and the liability issues. If the courts continue in the future to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage, as they have in the past, additional liabilities would emerge for amounts in excess of reserves held. This emergence cannot now be reasonably estimated, but could have a material impact on AIG's future operating results. The reserves carried for these claims as at December 31, 1994 ($1.41 billion gross; $330.3 million net) are believed to be adequate as these reserves are based on known facts and current law. Furthermore, as AIG's net exposure retained relative to the gross exposure written was lower in those years, the potential impact of these claims is much smaller on the net loss reserves than on the gross loss reserves. 12.\"),\n",

These financial instruments may or may not be recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. In the measurement of the fair value of certain of the financial instruments, quoted market prices were not available and other valuation techniques were utilized. These derived fair value estimates are significantly affected by the assumptions used. FASB 107 excludes certain financial instruments, including those related to insurance contracts. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\\n12. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)\\nThe following methods and assumptions were used by AIG in estimating the fair value of the financial instruments presented:\\nCash and short-term investments: The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for these instruments approximate fair values. Fixed maturity securities: Fair values for fixed maturity securities carried at amortized cost or at market value were generally based upon quoted market prices. For certain fixed maturity securities for which market prices were not readily available, fair values were estimated using values obtained from independent pricing services. No other fair valuation techniques were applied to these bonds as AIG believes it would have to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived. Equity securities: Fair values for equity securities were based upon quoted market prices. Mortgage loans on real estate, policy and collateral loans: Where practical, the fair values of loans on real estate and collateral loans were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based upon AIG\\'s current incremental lending rates for similar type loans. The fair values of the policy loans were not calculated as AIG believes it would have to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived. Securities held for investment: Fair values for securities held for investment carried at amortized cost were based upon quoted market prices. For securities for which market prices were not readily available, fair values were estimated using quoted market prices of comparable investments. Trade receivables and trade payables: Fair values for trade receivables and trade payables approximate the carrying values presented in the consolidated balance sheet. Securities available for sale: Fair values for securities available for sale and related hedges were based on quoted market prices. For securities and related hedges for which market prices were not readily available, fair values were estimated using quoted market prices of comparable investments. Trading securities: Fair values for trading securities were based on current market value where available. For securities for which market values were not readily available, fair values were estimated using quoted market prices of comparable investments. Spot commodities: Fair values for spot commodities, which include options, were based on current market prices. Unrealized gains and losses on interest rate and currency swaps, options and forward transactions: Fair values for swaps, options and forward transactions were based on the use of valuation models that utilize, among other things, current interest, foreign exchange and volatility rates, as applicable. Securities purchased (sold) under agreements to resell (repurchase), at contract value: As these securities (obligations) are short-term in nature, the contract values approximate fair values. Other invested assets: For assets for which market prices were not readily available, fair valuation techniques were not applied as AIG believes it would have to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived. Policyholders\\' contract deposits: Fair values of policyholder contract deposits were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based upon interest rates currently being offered for similar contracts with maturities consistent with those remaining for the contracts being valued. GIAs: Fair values of AIG\\'s obligations under investment type agreements were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based on interest rates currently being offered for similar agreements with maturities consistent with those remaining for the agreements being valued. Additionally, AIG follows a policy of minimizing interest rate risks associated with GIAs by entering into swap transactions.

Both the 1991 plan, and the options with respect to 74,925 shares granted thereunder on December 19, 1991, were approved by shareholders at the 1992 Annual Meeting.

Additional information with respect to the AIG plans at December 31, 1994 was as follows:\\n15. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\\n(a) Employees of AIG, its subsidiaries and certain affiliated companies, including employees in foreign countries, are generally covered under various funded and insured pension plans. Eligibility for participation in the various plans is based on either completion of a specified period of continuous service or date of hire, subject to age limitation. While benefits vary, they are usually based on the employees\\' years of credited service and average compensation in the three years preceding retirement. AIG\\'s U.S. retirement plan is a qualified, noncontributory, defined benefit plan. All qualified employees who have attained age 21 and completed six months of continuous service are eligible to participate in this plan. An employee with 5 or more years of service is entitled to pension benefits beginning at normal retirement at age 65. Benefits are based upon a percentage of average final compensation multiplied by years of credited service commencing April 1, 1985 and limited to 44 years of credited service. The average final compensation is subject to certain limitations. Annual funding requirements are determined based on the \"projected unit credit\" cost method which attributes a pro rata portion of the total projected benefit payable at normal retirement to each year of credited service. AIG has adopted a Supplemental Executive Retirement Program (Supplemental Plan) to provide additional retirement benefits to designated executives and key employees. Under the Supplemental Plan, the annual benefit, not to exceed 60 percent of average final compensation, accrues at a percentage of average final pay multiplied for each year of credited service reduced by any benefits from the current and any predecessor retirement plans, Social Security, if any, and from any qualified pension plan of prior employers. The Supplemental Plan also provides a benefit equal to the reduction in benefits payable under the AIG retirement plan as a result of Federal limitations on benefits payable thereunder. Currently, the Supplemental Plan is unfunded. Eligibility for participation in the various non-U.S. retirement plans is either based on completion of a specified period of continuous service or date of hire, subject to age limitation. While benefits vary, they are generally based on the employees\\' years of credited service and average compensation in the years preceding retirement. Assumptions associated with the projected benefit obligation and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at December 31, 1994 were as follows:\\n* The ranges for the non-U.S. plans reflect the local socioeconomic environments in which AIG operates.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (continued)\\nThe following table sets forth the funded status of the various pension plans and the amounts recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 1994 and 1993:\\n* Plan assets are invested primarily in fixed-income securities and listed stocks. Net pension cost for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992 included the following components:\\n* Net pension expense included $26,727, $20,999 and $13,478 related to non-U.S. plans for 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. (b) AIG sponsors a voluntary savings plan for domestic employees (a 401(k) plan), which, during the three years ended December 31, 1994, provided for salary reduction contributions by employees and matching contributions by AIG of up to 2 percent of annual salary. (c) In addition to AIG's defined benefit pension plan, AIG and its subsidiaries provide a postretirement benefit program for medical care and life insurance, domestically and in certain foreign countries. Eligibility in the various plans is generally based upon completion of a specified period of eligible service and reaching a specified age. Benefits vary by geographic location. AIG's U.S. postretirement medical and life insurance benefits are based upon the employee reaching age 55 with 10 years of service to be eligible for an immediate benefit from the U.S. retirement plan. Retirees and their dependents who were age 65 by May 1, 1989 participate in the medical plan at no cost. All other retirees and dependents over age 65 pay 50 percent of the premium that is paid by current active employees. Retirees under age 65 pay the full active premium and covered dependents pay twice the active employee amounts. Contributions are subject to adjustment annually. Other cost sharing features of the medical plan include deductibles, coinsurance and Medicare coordination and a lifetime maximum benefit of $1,000,000. The maximum life insurance benefit prior to age 70 is $32,500, with a maximum of $25,000 thereafter. Effective January 1, 1993, both plans' provisions were amended. Employees who retire on or after January 1, 1993 will be required to pay the actual cost of the medical benefits reduced by a credit which is based upon age and years of service at retirement. The life insurance benefit will vary by age at retirement from $5,000 for retirement at ages 55 through 59 to $15,000 for retirement at ages 65 and over. Assumptions associated with the accrued postretirement benefit liability at December 31, 1994 were as follows:\\n* The Medical trend rate grades downward from years 1 through 7 domestically and years 1 through 9 for the foreign benefits.\"),\n",

The following table shows identifiable assets, revenues and income derived from operations in the United States and Canada and from operations in other countries for the year ended December 31, 1995. (See also Note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nGENERAL INSURANCE OPERATIONS\\nAIG\\'s general insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance. One or more of these companies is licensed to write substantially all of these lines in all states of the United States and in more than 100 foreign countries. AIG\\'s business derived from brokers in the United States and Canada is conducted through its domestic brokerage group, consisting of American Home, National Union, Lexington and certain other insurance company subsidiaries of AIG. The primary casualty/risk management division of this group provides insurance and risk management programs for large corporate customers. The AIG global risk division designs and implements creative risk financing alternatives using the insurance and financial services capabilities of AIG. Also included are the operations of New Hampshire and its subsidiaries, which focus specifically on providing AIG products and services through brokers to middle market companies, and regional insurance companies which service the commercial middle market. The domestic brokerage division accepts business mainly from insurance brokers, enabling selection of specialized markets and retention of underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to submit business to these companies without the traditional agent-company contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no authority to commit the companies to accept a risk. In addition to writing substantially all classes of business insurance, including large commercial or industrial property insurance, excess liability, inland marine, workers\\' compensation and excess and umbrella coverages, the domestic brokerage division offers many specialized forms of insurance such as directors and officers liability, difference-in-conditions, kidnap-ransom, export credit and political risk, and various types of professional errors and omissions coverages. Lexington writes surplus lines, those risks for which conventional insurance companies do not readily provide insurance coverage, either because of complexity or because the coverage does not lend itself to conventional contracts. Audubon Insurance Company and its subsidiaries (\"Audubon\") conduct agency marketing of personal and small commercial coverages in certain Southern and Western States. AIG engages in mass marketing of personal lines coverages, primarily private passenger auto, through American International Insurance Company and New Hampshire Indemnity Company, Inc. as well as through its interests in the Robert Plan Corporation and 20th Century Industries. The business of United Guaranty Corporation (\"UGC\") and its subsidiaries is also included in the domestic operations of AIG. The principal business of the UGC subsidiaries is the writing of residential mortgage loan insurance, which is guaranty insurance on conventional first mortgage loans on single-family dwellings and condominiums. Such insurance protects lenders against loss if borrowers default. UGC subsidiaries also write commercial mortgage loan insurance covering first mortgage loans on commercial real estate, home equity and property improvement loan insurance on loans to finance residential property improvements, alterations and repairs and for other purposes not necessarily related to real estate, and rent guaranty insurance on commercial and industrial real estate. UGC had approximately $12 billion of mortgage guarantee risk in-force at December 31, 1995. AIG\\'s foreign general insurance business comprises primarily risks underwritten through American International Underwriters (\"AIU\"), a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned agencies and insurance companies. It also includes business written by foreign-based insurance subsidiaries of AIUO for their own accounts. In general, the same types of policies and marketing methods, with certain refinements for local laws, customs and needs, are used in these foreign operations as have been described above in connection with the domestic operations. During 1995 domestic general and foreign general insurance business accounted for 64.7 percent and 35.3 percent, respectively, of AIG\\'s net premiums written. AIG\\'s general insurance company subsidiaries worldwide operate primarily by underwriting and accepting any size risk for their direct account and securing reinsurance on that portion of the risk in excess of the limit which they wish to retain. This operating policy differs from that of many insurance companies which will underwrite only up to their net retention limit, thereby requiring the broker or agent to secure commitments from other underwriters for the remainder of the gross risk amount. The following table summarizes general insurance premiums written and earned:\\nThe utilization of reinsurance is closely monitored by an internal reinsurance security committee, consisting of members of AIG\\'s Senior Management. No single reinsurer is a material reinsurer to AIG nor is AIG\\'s business substantially dependent upon any reinsurance contract. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG is well diversified both in terms of lines of business and geographic locations. Of the general insurance lines of business, workers\\' compensation was approximately 13 percent of AIG\\'s net premiums written. This line is well diversified geographically and is generally written on a loss sensitive basis which reduces its exposure to material uncertainty or risks. Notwithstanding the above, the majority of AIG\\'s insurance business is in the casualty classes, which tend to involve longer periods of time for the reporting and settling of claims. This may increase the risk and uncertainty with respect to AIG\\'s loss reserve development. (See also the Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Net Loss and Loss Expense Reserve Development and Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nThe following table is a summary of the general insurance operations, including ratios, by major operating category for the year ended December 31, 1995.

Loss and expense ratios of AIG\\'s consolidated general insurance operations are set forth in the following table. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\n* Source: Best\\'s Aggregates & Averages (Stock insurance companies, after dividends to policyholders) and the ratio for 1995 reflects estimated results provided by Conning & Company. During 1995, of the direct general insurance premiums written (gross premiums less return premiums and cancellations, excluding reinsurance assumed and before deducting reinsurance ceded), 7.2 percent and 8.9 percent were written in California and New York, respectively (no other state accounted for more than 5 percent of such premiums). There was no significant adverse effect on AIG\\'s results of operations from the economic environments in any one state, country or geographic region for the year ended December 31, 1995. DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED NET LOSS AND LOSS EXPENSE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT\\nThe reserve for net losses and loss expenses is exclusive of applicable reinsurance and represents the accumulation of estimates for reported losses (\"case basis reserves\") and provisions for losses incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\"). AIG does not discount its loss reserves other than for minor amounts related to certain workers\\' compensation claims. Loss reserves established with respect to foreign business are set and monitored in terms of the respective local or functional currency. Therefore, no assumption is included for changes in currency rates. (See also Note 1(t) of Notes to Financial Statements.) Losses and loss expenses are charged to income as incurred. Management continually reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves through the utilization of a number of analytical reserve development techniques (discussed below). Through the use of these techniques, management is able to monitor the adequacy of its established reserves, including the appropriate assumptions for inflation. Also, through reactions to the emergence of specific development patterns, such as case reserve redundancies or deficiencies and IBNR emergence, management is able to currently determine any required adjustments. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nThe \"Analysis of Consolidated Net Loss and Loss Expense Reserve Development\", which follows, presents the development of net loss and loss expense reserves for calendar years 1985 through 1995. The upper half of the table shows the cumulative amounts paid during successive years related to the opening loss reserves. For example, with respect to the net loss and loss expense reserve of $11,086.1 million as of December 31, 1988, by the end of 1995 (seven years later) $9,737.0 million\\nhad actually been paid in settlement of these net loss reserves. In addition, as reflected in the lower section of the table, the original reserve of $11,086.1 million was reestimated to be $11,301.5 million at December 31, 1995. This increase from the original estimate would generally be a combination of a number of factors, including reserves being settled for larger amounts than originally estimated.'),\n",

BUSINESS', 'filename': '5272_1995.txt', 'cik': '0000005272', 'year': 1995, 'chunk_index': 7}, page_content='The original estimates will also be increased or decreased as more information becomes known about the individual claims and overall claim frequency and severity patterns. The redundancy (deficiency) depicted in the table, for any particular calendar year, shows the aggregate change in estimates over the period of years subsequent to the calendar year reflected at the top of the respective column heading. For example, the redundancy of $280.4 million at December 31, 1995 related to December 31, 1994 net losses and loss expense reserves of $18,418.9 million represents the cumulative amount by which reserves for 1994 and prior years have developed redundantly during 1995. ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED NET LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT\\nThe trend depicted in the latest development year in the reestimated liability portion of the \"Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development\" table indicates that the overall position of AIG\\'s 1994 and prior reserves one year later is fairly comparable to the trends reflected in recent years. The variations in development from original reserves in the later years of the table are relatively insignificant both in terms of aggregate amounts and as a percentage of the initial reserve balances. RECONCILIATION OF NET RESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSES\\n* Does not include the effects of foreign exchange adjustments which are reflected in the \"Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development\" table. Approximately 50 percent of the net losses and loss expense reserves are paid out within two years of the date incurred. The remaining net losses and loss expense reserves, particularly those associated with the casualty lines of business, may extend to 20 years or more. For further discussion regarding net reserves for losses and loss expenses, see Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The reserve for losses and loss expenses as reported in AIG\\'s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 1995, differs from the total reserve reported in the Annual Statements filed with state insurance departments and, where appropriate, with foreign regulatory authorities. The difference at December 31, 1995 is primarily because of minor discounting on certain workers\\' compensation claims, estimates for unrecoverable reinsurance and additional reserves relating to certain foreign operations. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nThe reserve for gross losses and loss expenses is prior to reinsurance and represents the accumulation for reported losses and IBNR. Management reviews the adequacy of established gross loss reserves in the manner previously described for net loss reserves. The \"Analysis of Consolidated Gross Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development\", which follows, presents the development of gross losses and loss expense reserves for calendar years 1992 through 1995. As with the net losses and loss expense reserve development, the redundancies of $430.0 million, $509.7 million and $676.5 million for 1992, 1993 and 1994, respectively, are relatively insignificant both in terms of an aggregate amount and as a percentage of the initial reserve balance. ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED GROSS LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT\\nLIFE INSURANCE OPERATIONS\\nAIG\\'s life insurance subsidiaries offer a wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment products. One or more of these subsidiaries is licensed to write life insurance in all states in the United States and in over 70 foreign countries. Traditional products consist of individual and group life, annuity, and accident and health policies. Financial and investment products consist of single premium annuity, variable annuities, guaranteed investment contracts and universal life. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nIn the United States, AIG has four domestic life subsidiaries: American International Life Assurance Company of New York, AIG Life Insurance Company, Delaware American Life Insurance Company, and Pacific Union Assurance Company. These companies utilize multiple distribution channels including brokerage and career and general agents to offer primarily financial and investment products and specialty forms of accident and health coverage for individuals and groups, including employee benefit plans. The domestic life business comprised 5.8 percent of total life premium income in 1995. Life insurance operations in foreign countries comprised 94.2 percent of life premium income and 94.5 percent of operating income in 1995. AIG operates overseas principally through four subsidiary companies, ALICO, AIA , Nan Shan and PHILAM. Although ALICO is incorporated in Delaware, all of its business is written outside of the United States. ALICO has operations either directly or through subsidiaries in approximately 50 countries located in Europe, Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and the Far East, with Japan being the largest territory. AIA operates primarily in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. Nan Shan operates primarily in Taiwan while PHILAM operates in the Philippines. Traditional life insurance products such as whole life and endowment continue to be significant in the overseas companies, especially in Southeast Asia, while a mixture of traditional, accident and health and financial products are sold in Japan. In addition to the above, AIG also has subsidiary operations in Switzerland (Ticino Societa d\\'Assicurazioni Sulla Vita), Puerto Rico (AIG Life Insurance Company of Puerto Rico) and conducts life insurance business through AIUO subsidiary companies in certain countries in Central and South America. The foreign life companies have approximately 105,000 career agents and sell their products largely to indigenous persons in local currencies. In addition to the agency outlets, these companies also distribute their products through direct marketing channels, such as mass marketing, and through brokers and other distribution outlets such as financial institutions.

AIG\\'s worldwide insurance investment policy places primary emphasis on investments in high quality, fixed income securities in all of its portfolios and, to a lesser extent, investments in marketable common stocks in order to preserve policyholders\\' surplus and generate net investment income. The ability to implement this policy is somewhat limited in certain territories as there may be a lack of qualified long term investments or investment restrictions may be imposed by the local regulatory authorities. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nAGENCY AND SERVICE FEE OPERATIONS\\nAIG\\'s agency and service fee operations contribute to AIG earnings through fees as agents and managers, the premiums they generate for AIG\\'s insurance companies and the revenues they produce from technical and support service activities. Several AIG companies act as managing general agents for both AIG subsidiaries and non-affiliated insurance companies, accepting liability on risks and actively managing the business produced. These general agencies deal directly with the producing agents and brokers, exercise full underwriting control, issue policies, collect premiums, arrange reinsurance, perform accounting, actuarial and safety and loss control services, adjust and pay losses and claims, and settle net balances with the represented companies. In some cases, they also maintain their own and the represented companies\\' authority to do business in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Agency and service fee operations are conducted primarily through AIG Risk Management, Inc., which provides risk management services to independent insurance agents, brokers and their customers on a worldwide basis and AIG Aviation Inc., which sells aviation insurance. FINANCIAL SERVICES OPERATIONS\\nAIG operations which contribute to financial services income include primarily A.I. Credit Corp. (\"AICCO\"), AIG Financial Products Corp. and its subsidiary companies (\"AIGFP\"), AIG Trading Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (\"AIGTG\"), International Lease Finance Corporation (\"ILFC\") and UeberseeBank AG. AICCO\\'s business is principally in premium financing. AIGFP engages in financial transactions, including long-dated interest rate and currency swaps and structures borrowings through guaranteed investment agreements. AIGTG engages in various commodities trading, foreign exchange trading and market making activities. ILFC is engaged primarily in the acquisition of new and used commercial jet aircraft and the leasing and remarketing of such aircraft to airlines around the world. UeberseeBank AG operates as a Swiss bank. Other financial services operations are AIG Global Investment Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, which manage the investment portfolios of various AIG subsidiaries, as well as third-party assets. AIG Asset Management Services, Inc. and AIG Capital Partners, Inc. are responsible for product design and origination, as well as marketing and distribution of third-party asset management products, including retail mutual funds and direct investment products.

ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS\\nAs of March 15, 1996, AIG holds a 48.3 percent interest in Transatlantic Holdings, Inc., a reinsurance holding company, and a 19.9 percent interest in Richmond Insurance Company, Ltd., a reinsurer. (See also Note 1(n) of Notes to Financial Statements.) AIG holds a 23.9 percent interest in SELIC Holdings, Ltd., an insurance holding company and a 24.4 percent interest in IPC Holding, Ltd., a reinsurance holding company. Other significant investments include minority positions in the Robert Plan Corporation, Kroll Holdings, Inc., Alexander and Alexander Services, Inc. and 20th Century Industries. LOCATIONS OF CERTAIN ASSETS\\nAs of December 31, 1995, approximately 37 percent of the consolidated assets of AIG were located in foreign countries (other than Canada), including $1.07 billion of cash and securities on deposit with foreign regulatory authorities. Foreign operations and assets held abroad may be adversely affected by political developments in foreign countries, including such possibilities as tax changes, nationalization and changes in regulatory policy, as well as by consequence of hostilities and unrest. The risks of such occurrences and their overall effect upon AIG vary from country to country and cannot easily be predicted. If expropriation or nationalization does occur, AIG's policy is to take all appropriate measures to seek recovery of such assets. Certain of the countries in which AIG's business is conducted have currency restrictions which generally cause a delay in a company's ability to repatriate assets and profits. (See also Notes 1(t), 2 and 18(d) of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nINSURANCE REGULATION AND COMPETITION\\nCertain states require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies which are licensed in such states and are controlled by other corporations. Applicable legislation typically requires periodic disclosure concerning the corporation which controls the registered insurer and the other companies in the holding company system and prior approval of intercorporate transfers of assets (including in some instances payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiary) within the holding company system. AIG's subsidiaries are registered under such legislation in those states which have such requirements. (See also Note 10(b) of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG's insurance subsidiaries, in common with other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and by other jurisdictions in which they do business. Within the United States, the method of such regulation varies but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory and supervisory powers to an insurance official. The regulation and supervision relate primarily to approval of policy forms and rates, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, including risk based capital measurements, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on investments, restrictions on the size of risks which may be insured under a single policy, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, methods of accounting, periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies, the form and content of reports of financial condition required to be filed, and reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than security holders. (See also Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nRisk Based Capital (RBC) is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. Thus, inadequately capitalized general and life insurance companies may be identified. The RBC formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. Higher factors are applied to more risky items and lower factors are applied to less risky items. Thus, the target level of statutory surplus varies not only as a result of the insurer's size, but also on the risk profile of the insurer's operations. The RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control. The statutory surplus of each of AIG's domestic general and life insurance subsidiaries exceeded their RBC standards by considerable margins as of December 31, 1995. To the extent that any of AIG's insurance entities would fall below prescribed levels of surplus, it would be AIG's intention to infuse necessary capital to support that entity. A substantial portion of AIG's general insurance business and a majority of its life insurance business is carried on in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies from minimal in some to stringent in others. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification or revocation by such authorities, and AIU or other AIG subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. In the past, AIU has been allowed to modify its operations to conform with new licensing requirements in most jurisdictions. In addition to licensing requirements, AIG's foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, policy language and terms, amount and type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of local investment and the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on participating policies. Some foreign countries regulate rates in various types of policies. Certain countries have established reinsurance institutions, wholly or partially owned by the state, to which admitted insurers are obligated to cede a portion of their business on terms which do not always allow foreign insurers, including AIG, full compensation. Regulations governing constitution of technical reserves and remittance balances in some countries may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets. The insurance industry is highly competitive. Within the United States, AIG's general insurance subsidiaries compete with approximately 4,300 other stock companies, specialty insurance organizations, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations. AIG's life insurance companies compete in the United States with some 1,600 life insurance companies and other participants in related financial service fields. Overseas, AIG subsidiaries compete for business with foreign insurance operations of the larger U.S. insurers and local companies in particular areas in which they are active. AIG's financial services subsidiaries, particularly AIGTG and AIGFP, operate in a highly competitive environment, both domestically and overseas. Principal sources of competition are banks, investment banks and other non-bank financial institutions.\"),\n",

MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\nOPERATIONAL REVIEW\\nGENERAL INSURANCE OPERATIONS\\nGeneral insurance operations for the twelve month periods ending December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 were as follows:\\nIn AIG\\'s general insurance operations, 1995 net premiums written and net premiums earned increased 9.5 percent and 10.9 percent, respectively, from those of 1994. In 1994, net premiums written increased 8.4 percent and net premiums earned increased 7.5 percent when compared to 1993. The growth in net premiums written in 1995 and 1994 resulted from a combination of several factors. Domestically, AIG continued to achieve some general price increases in certain commercial property and specialty casualty markets, as well as volume growth in personal lines. Overseas, the primary reasons for growth were price and volume increases. Foreign general insurance operations produced 35.3 percent of the general insurance net premiums written in 1995, 34.4 percent in 1994 and 30.4 percent in 1993. In comparing the foreign exchange rates used to translate AIG\\'s foreign general operations during 1995 to those foreign exchange rates used to translate AIG\\'s foreign general operations during 1994, the U.S. dollar declined in value in relation to most major foreign currencies in which AIG transacts business. Accordingly, when foreign net premiums written were translated into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation, total general insurance net premiums written were approximately 2.3 percentage points greater than they would have been if translated utilizing those exchange rates which prevailed during 1994. Net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies. The net unearned premium reserve constitutes the deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period. Thus, the net unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized as net premiums earned until the end of the policy period. The statutory general insurance ratios were as follows:\\nAdjusted underwriting profit or loss (operating income less net investment income and realized capital gains) represents statutory underwriting profit or loss adjusted primarily for changes in deferred acquisition costs. The adjusted underwriting profits were $361.6 million in 1995, $147.5 million in 1994 and $10.4 million in 1993. (See also Notes 4 and 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG\\'s results reflect the net impact with respect to incurred losses of catastrophes approximating $100 million in 1995, $55 million in 1994 and $70 million in 1993. AIG\\'s gross incurred losses from catastrophes approximated $190 million in 1995, $174 million in 1994 and $134 million in 1993. The Kobe Japan earthquake which struck in early 1995 resulted in gross and net incurred losses to AIG of approximately $73 million and $30 million, respectively. A substantial portion of the remaining balances resulted from storms which struck portions of the United States and the Caribbean. The Northridge earthquake which struck the Los Angeles area of California in January, 1994, resulted in gross and net incurred losses of approximately $174 million and $55 million, respectively. If these catastrophes were excluded from the losses incurred in each period, the pro forma consolidated statutory general insurance ratios would be as follows:\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nExcluding the effects of the aforementioned catastrophes, the general insurance operation has improved significantly over the three year period. AIG\\'s ability to maintain the pro forma combined ratio below 100 is primarily attributable to the profitability of AIG\\'s foreign general insurance operations and AIG\\'s emphasis on maintaining its disciplined underwriting, especially in the domestic specialty markets. In addition, AIG does not seek net premium growth where rates do not adequately reflect its assessment of exposures. General insurance net investment income in 1995 increased 7.7 percent when compared to 1994. In 1994, net investment income increased 7.1 percent over 1993. The growth in net investment income in each of the three years was primarily attributable to new cash flow for investment. The new cash flow was generated from net general insurance operating cash flow and included the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income. (See also the discussion under \"Liquidity\" herein.)\\nGeneral insurance realized capital gains were $68.1 million in 1995, $52.5 million in 1994 and $65.3 million in 1993. These realized gains resulted from the ongoing management of the general insurance investment portfolios within the overall objectives of the general insurance operations and arose primarily from the disposition of equity securities and available for sale and trading fixed maturities as well as redemptions of fixed maturities. General insurance operating income in 1995 increased 20.8 percent when compared to 1994. The 1994 results reflect an increase of 15.5 percent from 1993. The contribution of general insurance operating income to income before income taxes and the cumulative effect of accounting changes was 57.0 percent in 1995 compared to 55.4 percent in 1994 and 54.4 percent in 1993. A year to year comparison of operating income is significantly influenced by the catastrophe losses in any one year as well as the volatility from one year to the next in realized capital gains. Adjusting each year to exclude the effects of both catastrophe losses and realized capital gains, operating income would have increased by 22.6 percent in 1995 and 15.3 percent in 1994.'),\n",

AIG is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its general insurance operations. AIG is cognizant of the need to exercise good judgment in the selection and approval of both domestic and foreign companies participating in its reinsurance programs. AIG insures risks in over 100 countries and its reinsurance programs must be coordinated in order to provide AIG the level of reinsurance protection that AIG desires. These reinsurance arrangements do not relieve AIG from its direct obligations to its insureds. AIG's general reinsurance assets amounted to $16.88 billion and resulted from AIG's reinsurance arrangements. Thus, a credit exposure existed at December 31, 1995 with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer may not be able to reimburse AIG under the terms of these reinsurance arrangements. AIG manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound, and when necessary AIG holds substantial collateral in the form of funds, securities and/or irrevocable letters of credit. This collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods. The application of this collateral against balances due or any changes to the amount of collateral are based on the development of losses recoverable on an individual reinsurer basis.

It is AIG's belief that the ceded reserves at December 31, 1995 were representative of the ultimate losses recoverable. In the future, as the ceded reserves continue to develop to ultimate amounts, the ultimate loss recoverable may be greater or less than the reserves currently ceded. At December 31, 1995, general insurance reserves for losses and loss expenses (loss reserves) amounted to $33.05 billion, an increase of $1.61 billion or 5.1 percent over the prior year end and represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including IBNR, and loss expenses and minor amounts of discounting related to certain workers' compensation claims. General insurance net loss reserves increased $1.27 billion or 6.9 percent to $19.69 billion and represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverable, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance. The methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in operating income currently. It is management's belief that the general insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover all general insurance net losses and loss expenses as at December 31, 1995. In the future, if the general insurance net loss reserves develop deficiently, such deficiency would have an adverse impact on such future results of operations. In a very broad sense, the general loss reserves can be categorized into two distinct groups: one group being long tail casualty lines of business; the other being short tail lines of business consisting principally of property lines and including certain classes of casualty lines. Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses (net losses) for long tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the line and volume of the business involved. In the more recent accident years of long tail casualty lines there is limited statistical credibility in reported net losses. That is, a relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims and expenses and an even smaller proportion would be net losses paid. A relatively high proportion of net losses would therefore be IBNR. A variety of actuarial methods and assumptions are normally employed to estimate net losses for long tail casualty lines. These methods ordinarily involve the use of loss trend factors intended to reflect the estimated annual growth in loss costs from one accident year to the next. Loss trend factors reflect many items including changes in claims handling, exposure and policy forms and current and future estimates of monetary inflation and social inflation. Thus, many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the year to year growth in loss costs. Therefore, AIG's carried net long tail loss reserves are judgmentally set as well as tested for reasonableness using the most appropriate loss trend factors for each class of business. In the evaluation of AIG's net loss reserves, loss trend factors vary slightly, depending on the particular class and nature of the business involved. For the majority of long tail casualty lines, net loss trend factors approximating nine percent were employed. These factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss experience. Estimation of net losses for short tail business is less complex than for long tail casualty lines. Loss cost trends for many property lines can generally be assumed to be similar to the growth in exposure of such lines. For example, if the fire insurance coverage remained proportional to the actual value of the property, the growth in property's exposure to fire loss can be approximated by the amount of insurance purchased. For other property and short tail casualty lines, the loss trend is implicitly assumed to grow at the rate that reported net losses grow from one year to the next. The concerns noted above for longer tail casualty lines with respect to the limited statistical credibility of reported net losses generally do not apply to shorter tail lines. AIG continues to receive indemnity claims asserting injuries from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites (hereinafter collectively referred to as environmental claims) and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. The vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained an absolute exclusion for pollution related damage. However, AIG currently underwrites pollution impairment liability insurance on a claims made basis and excluded such claims from the analyses included herein. AIG has established a specialized claims unit which investigates and adjusts all such asbestos and environmental claims. Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a difficult process. These asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated by conventional reserving techniques as previously described. Quantitative techniques frequently have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including managerial judgment. Significant factors which affect the trends which influence the development of asbestos and environmental claims are the inconsistent court resolutions, judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage and the increasing number of new claims. The case law that has emerged can be characterized as still being in its infancy and the likelihood of any firm direction in the near future is very small.\"),\n",

The reserves carried for these claims at December 31, 1995 are believed to be adequate as these reserves are based on the known facts and current law.

Such payments include indemnity payments and legal and loss adjustment payments. It should be noted, however, that this is an extremely simplistic approach to measuring asbestos and environmental reserve levels. Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have significant impact on the amount of asbestos and environmental losses and loss expense reserves, ultimate payments thereof and the resultant ratio. The aforementioned insurance rating agency has recently published the findings of its current studies with respect to the ultimate aggregate costs for toxic waste cleanups for the insurance industry. This agency has significantly lowered its ultimate aggregate cost projections that were published last year. Other published studies also project lower ultimate aggregate costs for toxic waste cleanups for the insurance industry. The developed survival ratios include both involuntary and voluntary indemnity payments. Involuntary payments include court judgments, court orders, covered claims with no coverage defenses, state mandated cleanup costs, claims where AIG's coverage defenses are minimal, and settlements made less than six months before the first trial setting. Also, AIG considers all legal and loss adjustment payments as involuntary. AIG believes voluntary indemnity payments should be excluded from the survival ratio. The special asbestos and environmental claims unit actively manages AIG's asbestos and environmental claims and proactively pursues early settlement of environmental claims for all known and unknown sites. As a result, AIG reduces its exposure to future environmental loss contingencies.

(See also Note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nLIFE INSURANCE OPERATIONS\\nLife insurance operations for the twelve month periods ending December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 were as follows:\\nAIG\\'s life insurance operations, demonstrating the strength of its franchise, continued to show growth primarily as a result of overseas operations, particularly in Asia. AIG\\'s life premium income in 1995 represented an 19.5 percent increase from the prior year. This compares with an increase of 17.0 percent in 1994 over 1993. Foreign life operations produced 94.2 percent, 94.5 percent and 95.3 percent of the life premium income in 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively. (See also Notes 1, 4 and 6 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAs previously discussed, the U.S. dollar declined in value in relation to most major foreign currencies in which AIG transacts business. Accordingly, when foreign life premium income was translated into U.S. dollars for purposes of consolidation, total life premium income was approximately 3.4 percentage points greater than it would have been if translated utilizing exchange rates prevailing in 1994. Life insurance net investment income increased 29.5 percent in 1995 compared to an increase of 16.6 percent in 1994. The growth in net investment income was primarily attributable to foreign new cash flow for investment and, to a lesser degree, growth in interest income earned on policy loans related to domestic corporate-owned life insurance products (COLI). The new cash flow was generated from life insurance operations and included the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income. (See also the discussion under \"Liquidity\" herein.)\\nThe growth in the premium income of the domestic life segment resulted primarily from the sales of terminal funded pension plan annuities and to a lesser extent the renewal of risk bearing premium related to COLI. Additionally, the interest income earned on the policy loans associated with the life products caused domestic investment income to increase significantly. The traditional life products, such as whole and term life and endowments, were the major contributors to the growth in foreign premium income and investment income, particularly in Asia, and continue to be the primary source of growth in the life segment. A mixture of traditional, accident and health and financial products are being sold in Japan. Life insurance realized capital gains were $32.7 million in 1995, $86.7 million in 1994 and $54.6 million in 1993. These realized gains resulted from the ongoing management of the life insurance investment portfolios within the overall objectives of the life insurance operations and arose primarily from the disposition of equity securities and available for sale fixed maturities and redemptions of fixed maturities. Life insurance operating income in 1995 increased 14.5 percent to $1.09 billion compared to an increase of 21.9 percent in 1994. Excluding realized capital gains from life insurance operating income, the percent increases would be 22.2 percent and 19.1 percent in 1995 and 1994, respectively. The contribution of life insurance operating income to income before income taxes and the cumulative effect of accounting changes amounted to 31.5 percent in 1995 compared to 32.3 percent in 1994 and 30.0 percent in 1993. The risks associated with the traditional life and accident and health products are underwriting risk and investment risk. The risk associated with the financial and investment contract products is investment risk. Underwriting risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the actual policy experience adversely emerging in comparison to the assumptions made in the product pricing associated with mortality, morbidity, termination and expenses. AIG\\'s life companies limit their maximum underwriting exposure on traditional life insurance of a single life to approximately one million dollars of coverage by using yearly renewable term rein-\\nMANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nsurance. The life insurance operations have not entered into assumption reinsurance transactions or surplus relief transactions during the three year period ended December 31, 1995. (See also Note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nThe investment risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the cash flows from the invested assets, primarily long-term fixed rate investments, being less than the cash flows required to meet the obligations of the expected policy and contract liabilities and the necessary return on investments. To minimize its exposure to investment risk, AIG tests the cash flows from the invested assets and the policy and contract liabilities using various interest rate scenarios to assess whether there is a liquidity excess or deficit. If a rebalancing of the invested assets to the policy and contract claims became necessary and did not occur, a demand could be placed upon liquidity. (See also the discussion under \"Liquidity\" herein.)\\nThe asset-liability relationship is appropriately managed in AIG\\'s foreign operations, as it has been throughout AIG\\'s history, even though certain territories lack qualified long-term investments or there are investment restrictions imposed by the local regulatory authorities. For example, in Japan and several Southeast Asia territories, the duration of the investments is often for a shorter period than the effective maturity of such policy liabilities. Therefore, there is a risk that the reinvestment of the proceeds at the maturity of the investments may be at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of the policy liabilities. In Japan, the average duration of the investment portfolio is 5.5 years, while the related policy liabilities are estimated to be 11.8 years. To maintain an adequate yield to match the interest required over the duration of the liabilities, constant management focus is required to reinvest the proceeds of the maturing securities without sacrificing investment quality. To the extent permitted under local regulation, AIG may invest in qualified longer-term securities outside Japan to achieve a closer matching in both duration and the required yield. AIG is able to manage any asset-liability duration difference through maintenance of sufficient global liquidity and to support any operational shortfall through its international financial network. Domestically, the asset-liability matching process is appropriately functioning as there are investments available to match the duration and the required yield. (See also the discussion under \"Liquidity\" herein.)\\nAIG uses asset-liability matching as a management tool to determine the composition of the invested assets and marketing strategies. As a part of these strategies, AIG may determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position due to anticipated interest rate or other economic changes. AGENCY AND SERVICE FEE OPERATIONS\\nAgency and service fee operating income in 1995 increased 5.1 percent to $56.9 million compared to $54.1 million in 1994 which was a decrease of 10.2 percent from 1993. The increase in operating income from 1993 resulted from the growth of risk management services. The decline in 1994 was due to reduced commission revenue in certain of AIG\\'s managing general agencies. Agency and service fee operating income contributed 1.6 percent to AIG\\'s income before income taxes and the cumulative effect of accounting changes in 1995 compared to 1.8 percent in 1994 and 2.3 percent in 1993.

OTHER OPERATIONS\\nIn 1995, AIG\\'s equity in income of minority-owned insurance operations was $81.7 million compared to $56.0 million in 1994 and $39.6 million in 1993. In 1995, the equity interest in insurance companies, which includes two equity operations which commenced business during 1993, represented 2.4 percent of income before income taxes and the cumulative effect of accounting changes compared to 1.9 percent in 1994 and 1.5 percent in 1993. Other realized capital losses amounted to $28.9 million, $52.3 million and $12.7 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Minority interest represents minority shareholders\\' equity in income of certain consolidated subsidiaries. In 1995, minority interest amounted to $36.3 million. In 1994 and 1993, minority interest amounted to $29.7 million and $26.9 million, respectively. Other income (deductions)-net includes AIG\\'s equity in certain minor majority-owned subsidiaries and certain partially-owned companies, realized foreign exchange transaction gains and losses in substantially all currencies and unrealized gains and losses in hyperinflationary currencies, as well as the income and expenses of the parent holding company and other miscellaneous income and expenses. In 1995, net deductions amounted to $91.2 million. In 1994 and 1993, net deductions amounted to $68.6 million and $46.9 million, respectively. Income before income taxes amounted to $3.47 billion in 1995 and $2.95 billion in 1994. Income before income taxes and the cumulative effect of accounting changes was $2.60 billion in 1993. In 1995, AIG recorded a provision for income taxes of $955.5 million compared to the provisions of $776.5 million and $683.0 million in 1994 and 1993, respectively. These provisions represent effective tax rates of 27.6 percent in 1995 and 26.3 percent in each of 1994 and 1993. The increase in the effective tax rate in 1995 over prior years is primarily due to the profitability of domestic general adjusted underwriting relative to income before income taxes and the cumulative effect of accounting changes. (See Note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nIncome before the cumulative effect of accounting changes amounted to $1.92 billion in 1993. At January 1, 1993, AIG\\'s equity in income of minority-owned insurance operations was positively impacted by the cumulative effect of accounting changes on such operations from the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 \"Accounting for Income Taxes\"(FASB 109), which was partially offset by the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 \"Employer\\'s Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pension Plans\" (FASB 106). AIG\\'s equity in the cumulative effect of such accounting changes was a net benefit of $20.7 million. Net income amounted to $2.51 billion in 1995, $2.18 billion in 1994 and $1.94 billion in 1993. The increases in net income over the three year period resulted from those factors described above. MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nCAPITAL RESOURCES\\nAt December 31, 1995, AIG had total capital funds of $19.83 billion and total borrowings of $17.99 billion. At that date, $14.32 billion of such borrowings were either not guaranteed by AIG or were matched borrowings under obligations of guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs). Total borrowings at December 31, 1995 and 1994 were as follows:\\n(a) AIG does not guarantee or support these borrowings. (b) Primarily capital lease obligations.'),\n",

This issuance of Funding\\'s commercial paper is subject to the approval of AIG\\'s Board of Directors. ILFC and A.I. Credit Corp. (AICCO) issue commercial paper for the funding of their own operations. AIG does not guarantee AICCO\\'s or ILFC\\'s commercial paper. However, AIG has entered into an agreement in support of AICCO\\'s commercial paper. From time to time, AIGFP may issue commercial paper to fund its operations. AIG guarantees AIGFP\\'s commercial paper. At December 31, 1995, AIGFP had no commercial paper outstanding. (See also the discussion under \"Derivatives\" herein and Note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG and Funding have entered into two syndicated revolving credit facilities (the Facilities) aggregating $1 billion. The Facilities consist of a $500 million 364 day revolving credit facility and a $500 million five year revolving credit facility. The Facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and also provide backup for AIG\\'s commercial paper programs administered by Funding. There are currently no borrowings outstanding under either of the Facilities, nor were any borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 1995. ILFC increased the aggregate principal amount outstanding of its medium term and term notes to $5.94 billion at December 31, 1995, a net increase of $992.0 million, and incurred a net increase in its capital lease obligations of $783.0 million at that date. At December 31, 1995, ILFC had $1.80 billion in aggregate principal amount of debt securities registered for issuance from time to time. ILFC sold $200 million of Market Auction Preferred Stock in 1995. The cash used to purchase flight equipment, including progress payments during the construction phase, is primarily derived from the proceeds of ILFC\\'s debt financings. The primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are the cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of flight equipment and the rollover of prior debt. (See also the discussions under \"Operational Review\" and \"Liquidity\" herein and Notes 1, 9 and 15 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nDuring 1995, AIG did not issue any medium term notes and $40.0 million of previously issued notes matured. At December 31, 1995, AIG had $247.0 million in aggregate principal amount of debt securities registered for issuance from time to time. An additional $500 million principal amount of debt securities was registered in February, 1996. (See also the discussion under \"Derivatives\" herein and Note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG\\'s capital funds have increased $3.41 billion in 1995. Unrealized appreciation of investments, net of taxes, increased $1.21 billion, primarily resulting from the rally of the domestic equity markets and the decline in domestic interest rates and its effect on the market values of bonds worldwide. As a result of AIG\\'s adoption of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 \"Accounting for Certain Investments on Debt and Equity Securities\", unrealized appreciation of investments, net of taxes, is now subject to increased volatility resulting from the changes in the market value of bonds available for sale. During 1995, the cumulative translation adjustment loss, net of taxes, increased $168.0 million and retained earnings increased $2.36 billion, resulting from net income less dividends.

AIG intends to continue to buy its common shares in the open market from time to time and to satisfy its obligations under various employee benefit plans through such purchases. Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by statutory authorities. AIG has in the past reinvested most of its unrestricted earnings in its operations and believes such continued reinvestment in the future will be adequate to meet any foreseeable capital needs.

LIQUIDITY\\nAt December 31, 1995, AIG\\'s consolidated invested assets included approximately $2.36 billion of cash and short-term investments. Consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in 1995 amounted to approximately $7.21 billion. Management believes that AIG\\'s liquid assets, its net cash provided by operations, and access to the capital markets will enable it to meet any foreseeable cash requirements. AIG\\'s liquidity is primarily derived from the operating cash flows of its general and life insurance operations. The liquidity of the combined insurance operations is derived both domestically and abroad. The combined insurance pretax operating cash flow is derived from two sources, underwriting operations and investment operations. In the aggregate, AIG\\'s insurance operations generated approximately $9.6 billion in pretax cash flow during 1995. Cash flow includes periodic premium collections, including policyholders\\' contract deposits, paid loss recoveries less reinsurance premiums, losses, benefits, acquisition and operating expenses paid. Generally, there is a time lag from when premiums are collected and, when as a result of the occurrence of events specified in the policy, the losses and benefits are paid. AIG\\'s insurance investment operations generated approximately $3.5 billion in investment income cash flow during 1995. Investment income cash flow is primarily derived from interest and dividends received and includes realized capital gains. The combined insurance pretax operating cash flow coupled with the cash and short-term investments of $1.87 billion provided the insurance operations with a significant amount of liquidity during 1995. This liquidity is available to purchase high quality and diversified fixed income securities and to a lesser extent marketable equity securities and to provide mortgage loans on real estate, policy and collateral and guaranteed loans. With this liquidity coupled with proceeds of approximately $13.8 billion from the maturities, sales and redemptions of fixed income securities and from the sales of marketable equity securities, AIG purchased approximately $19.5 billion of fixed income securities and marketable equity securities during 1995. During 1995, AIG received approximately $1 billion from redemptions of held to maturity municipal bonds. Prior to redemption, the yield on these bonds approximated eight percent. The yield on the reinvestment of the proceeds in bonds with similar characteristics averaged nearly six percent. AIG does not anticipate that these redemptions will have a significant effect on AIG\\'s general investment income, operations, financial condition or liquidity.

With respect to fixed maturities, AIG\\'s strategy is to invest in high quality securities while maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure to issuer, industry and/or country concentrations. The growth in the percentage distribution of fixed maturities available for sale, at market value is primarily attributable to the decline in domestic interest rates and the redesignation of approximately $2.8 billion of fixed maturities held to maturity to fixed maturities available for sale. This change was permitted by the transition provision for a one-time transfer of securities from held to maturity, at amortized cost as included in the Financial Accounting Standards Board\\'s \"Special Report, a Guide to the Implementation of Statement No. 115 on Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.\"\\nAt December 31, 1995, approximately 54 percent of the fixed maturity investments were domestic securities. Approximately 40 percent of such domestic securities were rated AAA, approximately two percent were below investment grade. A significant portion of the foreign insurance fixed income portfolio is rated by Moody\\'s, Standard & Poor\\'s (S&P) or similar foreign services. Similar credit quality rating services are not available in all overseas locations. AIG annually reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio nonrated fixed income investments, including mortgages. At December 31, 1995, approximately 46 percent of the foreign fixed income investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of AIG\\'s internal analysis were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities so rated. Less than one percent of these investments were deemed below investment grade and approximately four percent were not rated at that date. Although AIG\\'s fixed income insurance portfolios contain only minor amounts of securities below investment grade, any fixed income security may be subject to downgrade for a variety of reasons subsequent to any balance sheet date. There have been no significant downgrades as at March 1, 1996. At December 31, 1995, approximately five percent of the fixed maturities portfolio was Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs). All of the CMOs were investment grade and approximately 79 percent of the CMOs were backed by various U.S. government agencies. Thus, credit risk was minimal. CMOs are exposed to interest rate risk as the duration and ultimate realized yield would be affected by the accelerated prepayments\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nof the underlying mortgages.'),\n",

(See also the discussion under \"Derivatives\" herein.)\\nMortgage loans on real estate, policy and collateral loans comprised 11.3 percent of AIG\\'s insurance invested assets at December 31, 1995. AIG\\'s insurance holdings of real estate mortgages amounted to $2.1 billion of which 32 percent was domestic. At December 31, 1995, no domestic mortgages and only a nominal amount of foreign mortgages were in default. At December 31, 1995, AIG\\'s insurance holdings of collateral loans amounted to $845.1 million, all of which were foreign. It is AIG\\'s practice to maintain a maximum loan to value ratio of 75 percent at loan origination. AIG\\'s policy loans increased from $2.23 billion at December 31, 1994 to $3.95 billion at December 31, 1995, with approximately one billion dollars of this increase relating to the domestic corporate-owned life insurance product. Short-term investments represent amounts invested in various internal and external money market funds, time deposits and cash. AIG\\'s real estate investment properties are primarily occupied by AIG\\'s various operations. The current market value of these properties considerably exceeds their carrying value. Other invested assets were primarily comprised of both foreign and domestic private placements, limited partnerships and outside managed funds. In certain jurisdictions, significant regulatory and/or foreign governmental barriers exist which may not permit the immediate free flow of funds between insurance subsidiaries or from the insurance subsidiaries to AIG parent. These barriers generally cause only minor delays in the outward remittance of the funds. The following table is a summary of the composition of AIG\\'s financial services invested assets at December 31, 1995 and 1994. (See also the discussions under \"Operational Review,\" \"Capital Resources\" and \"Derivatives\" herein.)\\nAs previously discussed, the cash used for the purchase of flight equipment is derived primarily from the proceeds of ILFC\\'s debt financings. The primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are the cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of flight equipment and the rollover of prior debt. During 1995, ILFC acquired flight equipment costing $3.28 billion. At December 31, 1995, ILFC had committed to purchase or had secured positions for 292 aircraft deliverable from 1996 through 2004 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $15.9 billion and had options to purchase an additional 34 aircraft deliverable through 2005 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $2.5 billion. As at March 15, 1996, ILFC has entered into leases, letters of intent to lease or is in various stages of negotiation for all of the aircraft to be delivered in 1996 and 44 of 228 aircraft to be delivered subsequent to 1996. ILFC will be required to find customers for any aircraft presently on order and any aircraft to be ordered, and it must arrange financing for portions of the purchase price of such equipment. In a rising interest rate environment, ILFC negotiates higher lease rates on any new contracts. ILFC has been successful to date both in placing its new aircraft on lease or under sales contract and obtaining adequate financing. AIGFP\\'s derivative transactions are carried at market value or at estimated fair value when market prices are not readily available. AIGFP reduces its economic risk exposure through similarly valued offsetting transactions including swaps, trading securities, options, forwards and futures. The estimated fair values of these transactions represent assessments of the present value of expected future cash flows. These transactions are exposed to liquidity risk if AIGFP were to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes that the impact of any such limited liquidity would not be significant to AIG\\'s financial condition or its overall liquidity.

Trading securities, at market value are marked to market daily and are held to meet the short-term risk management objectives of AIGFP. AIGTG conducts, as principal, market making and trading activities in foreign exchange, interest rates, precious and base metals and natural gas and other energy products. AIGTG owns inventories in the commodities in which it trades and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the use of swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts. AIGTG uses derivatives to manage the economic exposure of its various trading positions and transactions from adverse movements of interest rates, exchange rates and commodity prices. AIGTG supports its trading activities largely through trade payables, unrealized losses on swaps, short-term borrowings and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased. (See also the discussions under \"Capital Resources\" and \"Derivatives\" herein.)\\nDERIVATIVES\\nDerivatives are financial arrangements among two or more parties whose returns are linked to or \"derived\" from some underlying equity, debt, commodity or other asset, liability, or some index. Derivatives payments may be based on interest rates and exchange rates and/or prices of certain securities, certain commodities, or financial or commodity indices. The more significant types of derivative arrangements in which AIG transacts are swaps, forwards, futures, options and related instruments. The most commonly used swaps are interest rate and currency swaps. An interest rate swap is a contract between two parties to exchange interest rate payments (typically a fixed interest rate versus a variable interest rate) calculated on a notional principal amount for a specified period of time. The notional amount is not exchanged.'),\n",

A futures or forward contract is a legal contract between two parties to purchase or sell at a specified future date a specified quantity of a commodity, security, currency, financial index or other instrument, at a specified price. A futures contract is traded on an exchange, while a forward contract is executed over the counter. An option contract generally provides the option purchaser with the right but not the obligation to buy or sell during a period of time or at a specified date the underlying instrument at a set price. The option writer is obligated to sell or buy the underlying item if the option purchaser chooses to exercise his right. The option writer receives a nonrefundable fee or premium paid by the option purchaser. Derivatives are generally either negotiated over the counter contracts or standardized contracts executed on an exchange. Standardized exchange traded derivatives include futures and options which can be readily bought or sold over recognized security exchanges and settled daily through such clearing houses. Negotiated over the counter derivatives include forwards, swaps and options. Over the counter derivatives are generally not traded like exchange traded securities. However, in the normal course of business, with the agreement of the original counterparty, these contracts may be terminated early or assigned to another counterparty. All significant derivatives activities are conducted through AIGFP and AIGTG permitting AIG to participate in the derivatives dealer market acting primarily as principal. In these derivative operations, AIG structures agreements which generally allow its counterparties to enter into transactions with respect to changes in interest and exchange rates, securities' prices and certain commodities and financial or commodity indices. Generally, derivatives are used by AIG's customers such as corporations, financial institutions, multinational organizations, sovereign entities, government agencies and municipalities. For example, a futures, forward or option contract can be used to protect the customers' assets or liabilities against price fluctuations. The senior management of AIG, with review by the Board of Directors, defines the policies and establishes general operating parameters for AIGFP and AIGTG. AIG's senior management has established various oversight committees to review the various financial market, operational and credit issues of AIGFP and AIGTG. The senior managements of AIGFP and AIGTG report the results of their respective operations to and review future strategies with AIG's senior management. AIG actively manages the exposures to limit potential losses, while maximizing the rewards afforded by these business opportunities. In doing so, AIG must manage a variety of exposures including credit, market, liquidity, operational and legal risks. Market risk principally arises from the uncertainty that future earnings are exposed to potential changes in volatility, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices. AIG generally controls its exposure to market risk by taking offsetting positions. AIG's philosophy with respect to its financial services operations is to minimize or set limits for open or uncovered positions that are to be carried. Credit risk exposure is separately managed.\"),\n",

Additionally, AIGFP operates in major business centers overseas and is essentially open for business 24 hours a day. Thus, the market exposure and offset strategies are monitored, reviewed and coordinated around the clock. Therefore, offsetting adjustments can be made as and when necessary from any AIGFP office in the world. As part of its monitoring and controlling of its exposure to market risk, AIGFP applies various testing techniques which reflect potential market movements. These techniques vary by currency and are regularly changed to reflect factors affecting the derivatives portfolio. In addition to the daily monitoring, AIGFP\\'s senior management and local risk managers conduct a weekly review of the derivatives portfolio and existing hedges. This review includes an examination of the portfolio\\'s risk measures, such as aggregate option sensitivity to movements in market variables. AIGFP\\'s management may change these measures to reflect their judgment and evaluation of the dynamics of the markets. This management group will also determine whether additional or alternative action is required in order to manage the portfolio. AIG utilizes an outside consultant to provide the managements of AIG and AIGFP with comfort that the system produces representative values. AIGTG\\'s approach to managing market risk is to establish an appropriate offsetting position to a particular transaction or group of transactions depending upon the extent of market risk AIGTG wishes to reduce. AIGTG senior management has established positions and stop-loss limits for each line of business. AIGTG\\'s traders are required to maintain positions within these limits. These positions are monitored during the day either manually or through on-line computer systems. In addition, these positions are reviewed by AIGTG management. Reports which present each trading book\\'s position and the prior day\\'s profit and loss are reviewed by traders, head traders and AIGTG\\'s senior management. Based upon these and other reports, AIGTG\\'s senior management may determine to adjust AIGTG\\'s risk profile. AIGTG attempts to secure reliable current market prices, such as published prices or third party quotes, to value its derivatives. Where such prices are not available, AIGTG uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions. The methodology may reflect interest and exchange rates, commodity prices, volatility rates and other relevant factors. A significant portion of AIGTG\\'s business is transacted in liquid markets.

(c) At December 31, 1995, AIGTG\\'s net replacement values with respect to interest rate and currency swaps were $356.0 million and $1.71 billion with respect to futures and forward contracts. (d) The net replacement value with respect to purchased option contracts of AIGTG at December 31, 1995 was $459.0 million. MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThe interest rate risk on securities available for sale, at market, is managed by taking offsetting positions on a security by security basis, thereby offsetting a significant portion of the unrealized appreciation or depreciation. At December 31, 1995, the unrealized gains and losses remaining after benefit of the offsets were $6.6 million and $6.1 million, respectively. AIGFP carries its derivatives at market or estimated fair value, whichever is appropriate. Because of limited liquidity of certain of these instruments, the recorded estimated fair values of these derivatives may be different than the values that might be realized if AIGFP were to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. (See also the discussions under \"Operational Review: Financial Services\" and \"Liquidity\" herein.)\\nTrading securities, at market value, and securities sold but not yet purchased are marked to market daily with the unrealized gain or loss being recognized in income at that time. These securities are held to meet the short-term risk management objectives of AIGFP. AIGTG conducts as principal, market making and trading activities in foreign exchange, interest rates, precious and base metals and natural gas and other energy products. AIGTG owns inventories in the commodities in which it trades. These inventories are carried at market and may be substantially hedged. AIGTG uses derivatives to manage the economic exposure of its various trading positions and transactions from adverse movements in interest rates, exchange rates and commodity prices. (See also the discussions under \"Operational Review: Financial Services\" and \"Liquidity\" herein.)\\nA counterparty may default on any obligation to AIG, including a derivative contract. Credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and/or carrying trading and investment positions. Credit risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has an estimated positive fair value. To help manage this risk, the credit departments of AIGFP and AIGTG operate within the guidelines of the AIG Credit Risk Committee, which sets credit policy and limits for counterparties and provides limits for derivative transactions with counterparties having different credit ratings. In addition to credit ratings, this committee takes into account other factors, including the industry and country of the counterparty. Transactions which fall outside these pre-established guidelines require the approval of the AIG Credit Risk Committee. It is also AIG\\'s policy to establish reserves for potential credit impairment when necessary. AIGFP and AIGTG determine the credit quality of each of their counterparties taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized statistical rating organizations. If it is determined that a counterparty requires credit enhancement, then one or more enhancement techniques will be used. Examples of such enhancement techniques include letters of credit, guarantees, collateral credit triggers and credit derivatives and margin agreements. A significant majority of AIGFP\\'s transactions are contracted and documented under ISDA Master Agreements that provide for legally enforceable set-off and close out netting of exposures in the event of default. Under such agreements, in connection with the early termination of a transaction, AIGFP is permitted to set-off its receivables from a counterparty against AIGFP\\'s payables to that same counterparty arising out of all included transactions. Excluding regulated exchange transactions, AIGTG, whenever possible, enters into netting agreements with its counterparties which are similar in effect to those discussed above. The following tables provide the notional and contractual amounts of AIGFP\\'s derivatives portfolio at December 31, 1995. The notional amounts used to express the extent of AIGFP\\'s involvement in swap transactions represent a standard of measurement of the volume of AIGFP\\'s swaps business. Notional amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and it may not necessarily be recorded on the balance sheet. Notional amounts represent those amounts used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received, except for certain contracts such as currency swaps. The timing and the amount of cash flows relating to foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures and options contracts are determined by each of the respective contractual agreements. The net replacement value most closely represents the net credit risk to AIGFP or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss after the application of the aforementioned strategies, ISDA Master Agreements and collateral held.

MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nGenerally, AIG manages and operates its businesses in the currencies of the local operating environment. Thus, exchange gains or losses occur when AIG\\'s foreign currency net investment is affected by changes in the foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar from one reporting period to the next. As an end user, AIG and its subsidiaries, including its insurance subsidiaries, use derivatives to aid in managing AIG\\'s foreign exchange translation exposure. Derivatives may also be used to minimize certain exposures with respect to AIG\\'s debt financing and insurance investment operations; to date, such activities have been minor. AIG, through its Foreign Exchange Operating Committee, evaluates its worldwide consolidated net asset or liability positions and manages AIG\\'s translation exposure to adverse movement in currency exchange rates. AIG may use forward exchange contracts and purchases options where the cost of such is reasonable and markets are liquid to reduce these exchange translation exposures. The exchange gain or loss with respect to these hedging instruments is recorded on an accrual basis as a component of the cumulative translation adjustment account in capital funds. AIG\\'s largest currency net investments have had historically stable exchange rates with respect to the U.S. dollar. Management of AIG\\'s liquidity profile is designed to ensure that even under adverse conditions AIG is able to raise funds at the most economical cost to fund maturing liabilities and capital and liquidity requirements of its subsidiaries. Sources of funds considered in meeting these objectives include guaranteed investment agreements, issuance of long and short-term debt, maturities and sales of securities available for sale, securities sold under repurchase agreements, trade payables, securities and spot commodities sold, not yet purchased, issuance of equity, and cash provided from operations. AIG\\'s strong capital position is integral to managing liquidity, as it enables AIG to raise funds in diverse markets worldwide. (See also the discussions under \"Capital Resources\" and \"Liquidity\" herein.)\\nLegal risk arises from the uncertainty of the enforceability, through legal or judicial processes, of the obligations of AIG\\'s clients and counterparties, including contractual provisions intended to reduce credit exposure by providing for the netting of mutual obligations. (See also the discussion on master netting agreements above.) AIG seeks to eliminate or minimize such uncertainty through continuous consultation with internal and external legal advisors, both domestically and abroad, in order to understand the nature of legal risk, to improve documentation and to strengthen transaction structure. Over the counter derivatives are not transacted in an exchange traded environment.'),\n",

Over the counter derivatives dealers have drafted a code of conduct to provide standards for their industry. The alternative to self-regulation is federal regulation. AIG supports self-regulation and expects to adhere to promulgated standards. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\\nIn March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 \"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-lived Assets and for Long-lived Assets to Be Disposed Of\" (FASB 121). This statement requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and an impairment loss must be recognized. FASB 121 is effective for AIG commencing January 1, 1996. AIG believes that the adoption of this statement in 1996 will have an immaterial impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In October 1995, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 \"Accounting for Awards of Stock-Based Compensation to Employees\" (FASB 123). FASB 123 establishes accounting and reporting standards for stock-based employee compensation plans. These plans include stock option and stock purchase plans. FASB 123 provides employers a choice: Adopt FASB 123 accounting standards for all stock compensation arrangements which requires the recognition of compensation expense for the fair value of virtually all stock compensation awards; or continue to account for stock options and other forms of stock compensation under the current accounting standards (APB No. 25 \"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees\") while also providing the disclosure required under FASB 123. AIG has adopted the disclosure requirements of FASB 123 effective for the year ended December 31, 1995 financial statements. In December 1995, FASB issued \"Special Report, a Guide to the Implementation of Statement No. 115 on Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.\" Among other things, this guide provided for a transition provision permitting a one-time transfer of debt securities from the held to maturity classification to the available for sale classification. Pursuant thereto, AIG has transferred approximately $2.8 billion of bonds held to maturity, at amortized cost, having a market value of approximately $100 million in excess of such amortized cost. In 1994, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued a Statement of Position (SOP) 94-6 \"Disclosure of Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties\" (SOP 94-6). Pursuant to SOP 94-6, AIG has made certain disclosures as to risks and uncertainties and the nature of AIG\\'s operations and AIG\\'s use of estimates in the preparation of its 1995 financial statements.

We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the financial statement schedules of American International Group, Inc. and subsidiaries listed in the index on page 33 of this Form 10-K. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and the financial statement schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of American International Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information required to be included therein.

The reserve for unearned premiums represents the portion of net premiums written relating to the unexpired terms of coverage. Acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned. Investment income is not anticipated in the deferral of acquisition costs (see Note 4). Losses and loss expenses are charged to income as incurred. The reserve for losses and loss expenses represents the accumulation of estimates for reported losses and includes provisions for losses incurred but not reported. The methods of determining such estimates and establishing resulting reserves, including amounts relating to reserves for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance, are continually reviewed and updated. Adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in income currently. AIG does not discount its loss reserves, other than for very minor amounts related to certain workers' compensation claims. Life Insurance Operations: AIG's life insurance subsidiaries offer a wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment products. One or more of these subsidiaries is licensed to write life insurance in all states in the United States and in over 70 foreign countries. Traditional products consist of individual and group life, annuity, and accident and health policies. Financial and investment products consist of single premium annuity, variable annuities, guaranteed investment contracts and universal life. Premiums for traditional life insurance products are generally recognized as revenues over the premium paying period of the related policies. Benefits and expenses are provided against such revenues to recognize profits over the estimated life of the policies. Revenues for universal life and investment-type products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, administration, and surrenders during the period. Expenses include interest credited to policy account balances and benefit payments made in excess of policy account balances. Investment income reflects certain minor amounts of realized capital gains where the gains are deemed to be an inherent element in pricing certain life products in some foreign countries. Policy acquisition costs for traditional life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period of the policy. Deferred policy acquisition costs and policy initiation costs related to universal life and investment-type products are amortized in relation to expected gross profits over the life of the policies (see Note 4). The liabilities for future policy benefits and policyholders' contract deposits are established using assumptions described in Note 6. Financial Services Operations: AIG participates in the derivatives dealer market conducting, primarily as principal, an interest rate, currency and equity derivative products business. AIG also enters into long-dated forward foreign exchange contracts, option transactions, liquidity facilities, investment agreements and other structured transactions and invests in a diversified portfolio of securities. AIG engages in market making and trading activities, as principal, in foreign exchange, interest rates, precious and base metals and natural gas and other energy products. AIG owns inventories in the commodities in which it trades and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the use of swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts. AIG, as lessor, leases flight equipment principally under operating leases. Accordingly, income is reported over the life of the lease as rentals become receivable under the provisions of the lease or, in the case of leases with varying payments, under the straight-line method over the noncancelable term of the lease. In certain cases, leases provide for additional amounts contingent on usage. AIG is also a marketer of flight equipment and marketing revenues from such operations consist of net gains on sales of flight equipment, commissions and net gains on disposition of leased flight equipment. (c) Investments in Fixed Maturities and Equity Securities: Bonds and preferred stocks held to maturity, both of which are principally owned by the insurance subsidiaries, are carried at amortized cost where AIG has the ability and positive intent to hold these securities until maturity. Where AIG may not have the positive intent to hold these securities until maturity, those bonds are considered to be available for sale and carried at market value. Included in the bonds available for sale are collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). Premiums and discounts arising from the purchase of CMOs are treated as yield adjustments over their estimated life. Bond trading securities are carried at market value, as it is AIG's intention to sell these securities in the near term. Common and non-redeemable preferred stocks are carried at market value. Unrealized gains and losses from investments in equity securities and fixed maturities available for sale are reflected in capital funds, net of any related deferred income taxes. Unrealized gains\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\\nand losses from investments in trading securities are reflected in income currently. Realized capital gains and losses are determined principally by specific identification. Where declines in values of securities below cost or amortized cost are considered to be other than temporary, a charge is reflected in income for the difference between amortized cost and estimated net realizable value. (d) Mortgage Loans on Real Estate, Policy and Collateral Loans--net: Mortgage loans on real estate, policy loans and collateral loans are carried at unpaid principal balances. Impairment of mortgage loans on real estate and collateral loans is generally measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate subject to the fair value of underlying collateral. Interest income on such loans is recognized as cash is received. (e) Flight Equipment: Flight equipment is stated at cost. Major additions and modifications are capitalized. Normal maintenance and repairs, airframe and engine overhauls and compliance with return conditions of flight equipment on lease are provided by and paid for by the lessee. Under the provisions of most leases for certain airframe and engine overhauls, the lessee is reimbursed for costs incurred up to but not exceeding contingent rentals paid to AIG by the lessee. AIG provides a charge to income for such reimbursements based upon the hours utilized during the period and the expected reimbursement during the life of the lease. Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line basis to a residual value of approximately 15 percent over the estimated useful lives of the related assets but not exceeding 25 years. This caption also includes deposits for aircraft to be purchased. At the time the assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the related accounts and the difference, net of proceeds, is recorded as a gain or loss. (f) Securities Available for Sale, at market value: These securities are held to meet long term investment objectives and are accounted for as available for sale, carried at market value and recorded on a trade date basis. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in capital funds, net of any related deferred income taxes. (g) Trading Securities, at market value: Trading securities are held to meet short term investment objectives, including hedging securities. These securities are recorded on a trade date basis and marked to market. The unrealized gains and losses are reflected in income.

(i) Unrealized Gain and Unrealized Loss on Interest Rate and Currency Swaps, Options and Forward Transactions: Swaps, options and forward transactions are accounted for as contractual commitments recorded on a trade date basis and are carried at market or estimated fair value when market values are not available. Estimated fair values are based on the use of valuation models that utilize, among other things, current interest, foreign exchange and volatility rates with the resulting unrealized gains or losses reflected in income currently. These valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows of these transactions and may include reserves for market risk as deemed appropriate. The portfolio's discounted cash flows are evaluated with reference to current market conditions, maturities within the portfolio and other relevant factors. Based upon this evaluation, it is determined what, if any, offsetting transactions are necessary to reduce the market risk of the portfolio. The recorded values of these transactions may be different than the values that might be realized if AIG were to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIG manages its market risk with a variety of transactions, including swaps, trading securities, futures and forward contracts and other transactions, as appropriate. (j) Trade Receivables and Trade Payables: Trade receivables and trade payables include balances due from and due to clearing brokers and exchanges and receivables from and payables to counterparties which relate to unrealized gains and losses on open futures and forward contracts, securities and commodities. (k) Securities Purchased (Sold) Under Agreements to Resell (Repurchase), at contract value: Purchases of securities under agreements to resell and sales of securities under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized transactions and are recorded at their contracted resale or repurchase amounts, plus accrued interest. Generally, it is AIG's policy to take possession of securities purchased under agreements to resell. AIG minimizes the credit risk that counterparties to transactions might be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations by monitoring customer credit exposure and collateral value and generally requiring additional collateral to be deposited with AIG when deemed necessary. (l) Other Invested Assets: Other invested assets consist primarily of investments in joint ventures and partnerships and other investments not classified elsewhere herein.

Equity in net income of other unconsolidated companies is principally included in other income (deductions)-net. At December 31, 1995, AIG's significant investments in partially-owned companies included its 48.3 percent interest in Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (Transatlantic), which derives a substantial portion of its assumed reinsurance from AIG subsidiaries; its 19.9 percent interest in Richmond Insurance Company; its 23.9 percent interest in SELIC Holdings, Ltd; and its 24.4 percent interest in IPC Holdings, Ltd. This balance sheet caption also includes investments in less significant partially-owned companies and in certain minor majority-owned subsidiaries. At December 31, 1995, the market value of AIG's investment in Transatlantic exceeded its carrying value by approximately $308.2 million.

This statement requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and an impairment loss must be recognized. FASB 121 is effective for AIG commencing January 1, 1996. AIG believes that the adoption of this statement in 1996 will have an immaterial impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In October 1995, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 \"Accounting for Awards of Stock-Based Compensation to Employees\" (FASB 123). FASB 123 establishes accounting and reporting standards for stock-based employee compensation plans. These plans include stock option and stock purchase plans. FASB 123 provides employers a choice: Adopt FASB 123 accounting standards for all stock compensation arrangements which requires the recognition of compensation\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\\nexpense for the fair value of virtually all stock compensation awards; or continue to account for stock options and other forms of stock compensation under the current accounting standards (APB No. 25 \"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees\") while also providing the disclosure required under FASB 123. AIG has adopted the disclosure requirements of FASB 123 effective for the year ended December 31, 1995 financial statements. In December 1995, FASB issued \"Special Report, a Guide to the Implementation of Statement No. 115 on Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.\" Among other things, this guide provided for a transition provision permitting a one-time transfer of debt securities from the held to maturity classification to the available for sale classification. Pursuant thereto, AIG has transferred approximately $2.8 billion of bonds held to maturity, at amortized cost, having a market value of approximately $100 million in excess of such amortized cost. In 1994, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) issued a Statement of Position (SOP) 94-6 \"Disclosure of Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties\" (SOP 94-6). Pursuant to SOP 94-6, AIG has made certain disclosures as to risks and uncertainties and the nature of AIG\\'s operations and AIG\\'s use of estimates in the preparation of its 1995 financial statements. (ii) Standards Adopted Prior to 1995: In November 1992, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112 \"Employers\\' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits\" (FASB 112). FASB 112 establishes accounting standards for employers who provide benefits to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement. FASB 112 was adopted by AIG effective January 1, 1994 and had no significant impact on AIG\\'s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In October 1994, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 119 \"Disclosure about Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments\" (FASB 119). FASB 119 requires disclosure about derivative financial instruments and amends FASB 105 \"Disclosure of Information about Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk and Financial Instruments with Concentrations of Credit Risk\" (FASB 105) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107 \"Disclosure about Fair Value of Financial Instruments\". FASB 119 requires disclosure about the amounts, nature and terms of derivatives that are not subject to FASB 105. Also, FASB 119 requires disclosure about financial instruments held or issued for trading purposes and purposes other than trading. This statement was adopted by AIG effective December 31, 1994. In December 1994, AICPA issued Statement of Position 94-5 \"Disclosure of Certain Matters in the Financial Statements of Insurance Enterprises\" (SOP 94-5). Pursuant to SOP 94-5, AIG has disclosed certain information with respect to unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses; accounting methods used by AIG\\'s insurance subsidiaries that are permitted by various domestic and foreign insurance regulatory authorities rather than prescribed by such authorities; and AIG\\'s policies and methodologies for estimating the liability for unpaid claim adjustment expense for difficult-to-estimate liabilities. In May 1993, FASB issued Statement of Accounting Standards No. 115 \"Accounting for Certain Investments on Debt and Equity Securities\" (FASB 115) and AIG adopted this standard at December 31, 1993. The pretax increase in carrying value of bonds available for sale as a result of marking to market was $919.3 million. The portion which inured to the benefit of policyholders was $511.8 million, which has been recorded as a component of future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts. Thus, the unrealized appreciation of investments increased $251.0 million, net of taxes of $156.5 million. 2.'),\n",

DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS\\nThe following reflects the policy acquisition costs deferred for amortization against future income and the related amortization charged to income for general and life insurance operations, excluding certain amounts deferred and amortized in the same period:\\n5. REINSURANCE\\nIn the ordinary course of business, AIG\\'s general and life insurance companies cede reinsurance to other insurance companies in order to provide greater diversification of AIG\\'s business and limit the potential for losses arising from large risks. General reinsurance is effected under reinsurance treaties and by negotiation on individual risks. Certain of these reinsurance arrangements consist of excess of loss contracts which protect AIG against losses over stipulated amounts. Amounts recoverable from general reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claims liabilities associated with the reinsurance and presented as a component of reinsurance assets. AIG life companies limit exposure to loss on any single life. For ordinary insurance, AIG retains a maximum of approximately one million dollars of coverage per individual life. There are smaller retentions for other lines of business. Life reinsurance is effected principally under yearly renewable term treaties. Amounts recoverable from life reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the assumptions used for the underlying policy benefits and are presented as a component of reinsurance assets. General insurance premiums written and earned were comprised of the following:\\nIn the normal course of their operations, certain AIG subsidiaries are provided reinsurance coverages from AIG\\'s minority-owned reinsurance companies. During 1995, 1994 and 1993, the premiums written which were ceded to Transatlantic amounted to $189,000,000, $200,000,000 and $238,100,000, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, reinsurance recoveries, which reduced loss and loss expenses incurred, amounted to $5.14 billion, $4.84 billion and $4.45 billion, respectively. Life insurance net premium income was comprised of the following:\\nLife insurance recoveries, which reduced death and other benefits, approximated $111.4 million, $96.0 million and $76.7 million, respectively, for each of the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993. AIG\\'s reinsurance arrangements do not relieve AIG from its direct obligation to its insureds. Thus, a credit exposure exists with respect to both general and life reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations assumed under the reinsurance agreements. AIG holds substantial collateral as security under related reinsurance agreements in the form of funds, securities and/or letters of credit. A provision has been recorded for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance. AIG has been largely successful in prior recovery efforts. AIG evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers through an internal reinsurance security committee consisting of members of AIG\\'s Senior Management. No single reinsurer is a material reinsurer to AIG nor is AIG\\'s business substantially dependent upon any reinsurance contract. American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n5. REINSURANCE (CONTINUED)\\nLife insurance ceded to other insurance companies was as follows:\\n* The principal reason for the increase in 1994 relates to life insurance in-force ceded with respect to corporate-owned life insurance. Life insurance assumed represented 0.1 percent of gross life insurance in-force at December 31, 1995 and 1994 and 0.5 percent for 1993, and 0.1 percent of gross premium income for each of the periods ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993. Supplemental information for gross loss and benefit reserves net of ceded reinsurance at December 31, 1995 and 1994 follows:\\n6. RESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSES AND FUTURE LIFE POLICY BENEFITS AND POLICYHOLDERS\\' CONTRACT DEPOSITS\\n(a) The following analysis provides a reconciliation of the activity in the reserve for losses and loss expenses:\\n(b) The analysis of the future policy benefits and policyholders\\' contract deposits liabilities as at December 31, 1995 and 1994 follows:\\n(c) Long duration contract liabilities included in future policy benefits, as presented in the table above, result from traditional life products. Short duration contract liabilities are primarily accident and health products. The liability for future life policy benefits has been established based upon the following assumptions:\\n(i) Interest rates (exclusive of immediate/terminal funding annuities), which vary by territory, year of issuance and products, range from 2.5 percent to 12.0 percent within the first 20 years. Interest rates on immediate/terminal funding annuities are at a maximum of 12.2 percent and grade to not greater than 7.5 percent. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n6. RESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSES AND FUTURE LIFE POLICY BENEFITS AND POLICYHOLDERS\\' CONTRACT DEPOSITS (Continued)\\n(ii) Mortality and surrender rates are based upon actual experience by geographical area modified to allow for variations in policy form. The weighted average lapse rate, including surrenders, for individual and group life approximated 7.3 percent. (iii) The portions of current and prior net income and of current unrealized appreciation of investments that can inure to the benefit of AIG are restricted in some cases by the insurance contracts and by the local insurance regulations of the countries in which the policies are in-force. (iv) Participating life business represented approximately 29 percent of the gross insurance in-force at December 31, 1995 and 47 percent of gross premium income in 1995. The amount of dividends to be paid is determined annually by the Boards of Directors. Anticipated dividends are considered as a planned contractual benefit in computing the value of future policy benefits and are provided ratably over the premium-paying period of the contracts. (d) The liability for policyholders\\' contract deposits has been established based on the following assumptions:\\n(i) Interest rates credited on deferred annuities vary by year of issuance and range from 4.0 percent to 8.3 percent. Credited interest rate guarantees are generally for a period of one year. Withdrawal charges generally range from 6.0 percent to 10.0 percent grading to zero over a period of 6 to 10 years. (ii) Domestically, GICs have market value withdrawal provisions for any funds withdrawn other than benefit responsive payments. Interest rates credited generally range from 4.7 percent to 9.1 percent and maturities range from 2 to 7 years. Overseas, primarily in the United Kingdom, GIC type contracts are credited at rates ranging from 5.0 percent to 6.4 percent with maturities generally being one year. Contracts in other foreign locations have interest rates, maturities and withdrawal charges based upon local economic and regulatory conditions. (iii) Interest rates on corporate-owned life insurance business are guaranteed at 4.0 percent and the weighted average rate credited in 1995 was 10.5 percent. (iv) The universal life funds have credited interest rates of 4.5 percent to 7.0 percent and guarantees ranging from 3.0 percent to 5.5 percent depending on the year of issue. Additionally, universal life funds are subject to surrender charges that amount to 8.5 percent of the fund balance grading to zero over a period not longer than 20 years. (e) Experience adjustments, relating to future policy benefits and policyholders\\' contract deposits, vary according to the type of contract and the territory in which the policy is in-force. In general terms, investments, mortality and morbidity results may be passed through by experience credits or as an adjustment to the premium mechanism, subject to local regulatory guidance. 7. STATUTORY FINANCIAL DATA\\nStatutory surplus and net income for general insurance and life insurance operations as reported to regulatory authorities were as follows:\\nAIG\\'s insurance subsidiaries file financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by domestic or foreign insurance regulatory authorities. The differences between statutory financial statements and financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP vary between domestic and foreign jurisdictions. The principal differences are that statutory financial statements do not reflect deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred income taxes, all bonds are carried at amortized cost and reinsurance assets and liabilities are presented net of reinsurance. AIG\\'s use of permitted statutory accounting practices does not have a significant impact on statutory surplus. 8. Investment Information\\n(a) Statutory Deposits: Cash and securities with carrying values of $3.65 billion and $3.04 billion were deposited by AIG\\'s subsidiaries under requirements of regulatory authorities as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain borrowers have the right to call or prepay certain obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. (e) Securities Available for Sale: AIGFP follows a policy of minimizing interest rate, equity and currency risks associated with securities available for sale by entering into swap or other transactions. In addition, to reduce its credit risk, AIGFP has entered into credit derivative transactions with respect to $1.10 billion of securities available for sale. At December 31, 1995, the cumulative increase in carrying value of the securities available for sale and related hedges as a result of marking to market such securities net of hedging transactions was $478,000.

Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain borrowers have the right to call or prepay certain obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. (f) CMOs: At December 31, 1995, CMOs, held by AIG's life companies, were presented as a component of bonds available for sale, at market value. All of the CMOs were investment grade and approximately 79 percent of the CMOs were backed by various U.S. government agencies. The remaining 21 percent were corporate issuances. At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the market value of the CMO portfolio was $2.2 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively; the amortized cost was approximately $2.1 billion in 1995 and $1.8 billion in 1994. AIG's CMO portfolio is readily marketable. There were no derivative (high risk) CMO securities contained in this portfolio at December 31, 1995. The distribution of the CMOs at December 31, 1995 and 1994 was as follows:\\nAt December 31, 1995, the gross weighted average coupon of this portfolio was 8.1 percent. The gross weighted average life of this portfolio was 6.7 years. (g) Fixed Maturities Below Investment Grade: At December 31, 1995, the fixed maturities and securities available for sale held by AIG that were below investment grade were insignificant. (h) During 1993, certain investments held by AIGFP experienced financial difficulties and suffered rating downgrades. The pretax impact on AIG of the estimated other than temporary impairment in value of these investments was $215 million. As is AIG's policy in such situations where credit ratings have deteriorated significantly, these impairments have been appropriately recognized by charges to income of $104 million in 1993 and $111 million prior to 1993. (i) At December 31, 1995, non-income producing invested assets were insignificant. 9. DEBT OUTSTANDING\\nAt December 31, 1995, AIG's debt outstanding of $17.99 billion, shown below, included borrowings of $14.32 billion which were either not guaranteed by AIG or were matched borrowings under obligations of guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs).

Obligations may be called at various times prior to maturity at the option of the counterparty. Interest rates on these borrowings are primarily fixed and range up to 10.6 percent. Payments due under these investment agreements in each of the next five years ending December 31, and the periods thereafter based on the earliest call dates, were as follows:\\nAt December 31, 1995, the market value of securities pledged as collateral with respect to these obligations approximated $1,081,000,000. (c) Medium Term Notes Payable:\\n(i) Medium Term Notes Payable Issued by AIG: AIG's Medium Term Notes are unsecured obligations which may not be redeemed by AIG prior to maturity and bear interest at either fixed rates set by AIG at issuance or variable rates determined by reference to an interest rate or other formula. An analysis of the Medium Term Notes for the year ended December 31, 1995 was as follows:\\nThe interest rates on this debt range up to 8.45 percent. To the extent deemed appropriate, AIG may enter into swap transactions to reduce its effective short-term borrowing rate. At December 31, 1995, the maturity schedule for AIG's outstanding Medium Term Notes was as follows:\\nAt December 31, 1995, AIG had $247,000,000 principal amount of Series D Medium Term Notes registered and available for issuance from time to time. (ii) Medium Term Notes Payable Issued by ILFC:ILFC's Medium Term Notes are unsecured obligations which may not be redeemed by ILFC prior to maturity and bear interest at fixed rates set by ILFC at issuance. As of December 31, 1995, notes in aggregate principal amount of $2,391,535,000 were outstanding with maturity dates varying from 1996 to 2005 at interest rates ranging from 4.5 percent to 9.88 percent. These notes provide for a single principal payment at the maturity of each note. At December 31, 1995, the maturity schedule for ILFC's outstanding Medium Term Notes was as follows:\\n(d) NOTES AND BONDS PAYABLE:\\n(i) Zero Coupon Notes: On October 1, 1984, AIG issued Eurodollar zero coupon notes in the aggregate principal amount at stated maturity of $750,000,000. The notes were offered at 12 percent of principal amount at stated maturity, bear no interest and are due August 15, 2004. The net proceeds to AIG from the issuance were $85,625,000. The notes are redeemable at any time in whole or in part at the option of AIG at 100 percent of their principal amount at stated maturity. The notes are also redeemable at the option of AIG or bearer notes may be redeemed at the option of the holder in the event of certain changes involving taxation in the United States at prices ranging from 38.28 percent currently, to 89.88 percent after August 15, 2003, of the principal amount at stated maturity together with accrued amortization of original issue discount from the preceding August 15. During 1995 and 1994, no notes were repurchased. At December 31, 1995, the notes outstanding had a face value of $189,200,000, an unamortized discount of $115,852,000 and a net book value of $73,348,000. The amortization of the original issue discount was recorded as interest expense. (ii) Italian Lire Bonds:In December, 1991, AIG issued unsecured bonds denominated in Italian Lire. The principal amount of 200 billion Italian Lire Bonds matures December 4, 2001 and accrues interest at a rate of 11.7 percent which is paid annually. These bonds are not redeemable prior to maturity, except in the event of certain changes involving taxation in the United States or the imposition of certain certification, identification or reporting requirements.\"),\n",

DEBT OUTSTANDING (CONTINUED)\\nSimultaneous with the issuance of this debt, AIG entered into a swap transaction which effectively converted AIG's net interest expense to a U.S. dollar liability of approximately 7.9 percent, which requires the payment of proceeds at maturity of approximately $159 million in exchange for 200 billion Italian Lire and interest thereon. (iii) Term Notes Issued by ILFC:ILFC has issued unsecured obligations which may not be redeemed prior to maturity. As of December 31, 1995, notes in aggregate principal amount of $3,550,000,000 were outstanding with maturity dates varying from 1996 to 2004 and interest rates ranging from 4.75 percent to 8.88 percent. $300,000,000 of such term notes are at floating interest rates and the remainder are at fixed rates. These notes provide for a single principal payment at maturity. At December 31, 1995, the maturity schedule for ILFC's Term Notes was as follows:\\nAIG does not guarantee any of the debt obligations of ILFC. (iv) Notes and Bonds Payable Issued by AIGFP: During 1992, AIGFP issued 200 million principal amount Netherland guilder denominated bonds which bear interest at a rate of 8.4 percent, payable annually, and mature on June 30, 1997. At December 31, 1995, these bonds had a carrying value of $110.1 million. During 1995, AIGFP issued notes as follows: (a) 249 million principal amount and 3 million principal amount Great Britain pound sterling denominated notes due December 29, 2000, with interest rates of 5.88 percent and 3 month sterling LIBOR, respectively, payable quarterly, and carrying values of $384.9 million and $4.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 1995; (b) 194 billion principal amount Italian lire denominated notes, which bear interest at a rate of 7.76 percent, payable annually, mature on December 31, 1998 and had a carrying value of $122.5 million at December 31, 1995; and (c) 180 million principal amount Australian dollar denominated notes, which bear interest at a rate of 5.87 percent, payable semi-annually, mature on January 2, 2003 and had a carrying value of $73.9 million at December 31, 1995. AIGFP has also issued various credit linked notes maturing from 1996 through 2000. These notes, which are primarily U.S. dollar denominated, have been issued to hedge certain credit risks in AIGFP's portfolio of securities available for sale. AIGFP's payment obligations under these notes are reduced or eliminated upon the occurrence of a payment default or bankruptcy event with respect to the reference third party credit that is being hedged. The notes bear interest at various interest rates. At December 31, 1995, these notes had a carrying value of $1.04 billion. AIGFP is also obligated under various notes maturing from 1996 through 2015. The majority of these notes are U.S. dollar and Japanese yen denominated and bear interest at various interest rates. At December 31, 1995, these notes had a carrying value of $130.7 million. AIG guarantees all of the notes and bonds issued by AIGFP. (e) Loans and Mortgages Payable:Loans and mortgages payable at December 31, 1995 consisted of the following:\\n* Primary capital lease obligations\\n(i) Capital Lease Obligations: At December 31, 1995, ILFC's capital lease obligations of $1.09 billion provide 10 year, fully amortizing debt with a portion of this debt at fixed rates varying from 6.18 percent to 6.89 percent and the remainder at a floating LIBOR base rate. The debt matures through 2005. The flight equipment associated with the obligations had a net book value of $1.22 billion. As of December 31, 1995, ILFC had the option to enter into an additional facility of $747 million for aircraft to be delivered in 1996 on the same terms as those for the existing facilities. (f) Interest Expense for All Indebtedness:Total interest expense for all indebtedness, net of capitalized interest, aggregated $1,361,140,000 in 1995, $1,289,277,000 in 1994 and $1,103,955,000 in 1993.

Certain foreign jurisdictions have restrictions which generally cause only a temporary delay in the remittance of dividends. There are also various local restrictions limiting cash loans and advances to AIG by its subsidiaries. Largely as a result of the restrictions, approximately 60 percent of consolidated capital funds were restricted from immediate transfer to AIG parent at December 31, 1995.

In addition, AIG guarantees various obligations of certain subsidiaries. (a) Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend subject to certain conditions. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses and typically require payment of a fee. At December 31, 1995 and 1994, these commitments, made principally by AIG Capital Corp., approximated $96,300,000 and $133,000,000, respectively. AIG uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. AIG evaluates each counterparty's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by AIG upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. (b) AIG and certain of its subsidiaries become parties to financial instruments with market risk resulting from both dealer and end user activities and to reduce currency, interest rate, equity and commodity exposures. To the extent those instruments are carried at their estimated fair value, the elements of currency, interest rate, equity and commodity risks are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. In addition, these instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk not explicitly recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. Collateral is required, at the discretion of AIG, on certain transactions based on the creditworthiness of the counterparty. (c) AIGFP becomes a party to off-balance sheet financial instruments in the normal course of its business and to reduce its currency, interest rate and equity exposures. Interest rate, currency and equity risks related to such instruments are reflected in the consolidated financial statements to the extent these instruments are carried at a market or a fair value, whichever is appropriate. Because of limited liquidity of certain of these instruments, the recorded estimated fair values of such instruments may be different than the values that might be realized if AIGFP were to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIGFP, as principal and for its own account, enters into interest rate, currency and equity swaps, swaptions and forward commitments. Interest rate swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. AIGFP typically becomes a principal in the exchange of interest payments between the parties and, therefore, may be exposed to loss, if counterparties default. Currency and equity swaps are similar to interest rate swaps, but may involve the exchange of principal amounts at the beginning and end of the transaction. At December 31, 1995, the notional principal amount of the sum of the swap pays and receives approximated $164.0 billion, primarily related to interest rate swaps of approximately $130.4 billion. The following tables provide the notional and contractual amounts of AIGFP's derivatives portfolio at December 31, 1995. The notional amounts used to express the extent of AIGFP's involvement in swap transactions represent a standard of measurement of the volume of AIGFP's swaps business. Notional amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and it may not necessarily be recorded on the balance sheet. Notional amounts represent those amounts used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received, except for certain contracts such as currency swaps. The timing and the amount of cash flows relating to foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures and options contracts are determined by each of the respective contractual agreements.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (CONTINUED)\\nThe following table presents AIGFP's swaps and swaptions portfolio by maturity and type of derivative at December 31, 1995:\\nFutures and forward contracts are contracts for delivery of foreign currencies or financial indices in which the seller/purchaser agrees to make/take delivery at a specified future date of a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield. Risks arise as a result of movements in current market prices from contracted prices and the potential inability of counterparties to meet their obligations under the contracts. At December 31, 1995, the contractual amount of AIGFP's futures and forward contracts approximated $18.3 billion. The following table presents AIGFP's futures and forward contracts portfolio by maturity and type of derivative at December 31, 1995:\\nThese instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk not explicitly recognized in the consolidated financial statements. AIGFP utilizes various credit enhancements, including collateral, credit triggers and credit derivatives to reduce the credit exposure relating to these off-balance sheet financial instruments. AIGFP requires credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties and the transaction's size and maturity. In addition, AIGFP's derivative transactions are generally documented under ISDA Master Agreements. Such agreements provide for legally enforceable set-off and close out netting of exposures to specific counterparties. Under such agreements, in connection with an early termination of a transaction, AIGFP is permitted to set off its receivables from a counterparty against its payables to the same counterparty arising out of all included transactions. As a result, the net replacement value represents the net sum of estimated positive fair values after the application of such strategies, agreements and collateral held. The net replacement value most closely represents the net credit risk to AIGFP or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss. The net replacement value of all interest rate, currency, and equity swaps, swaptions and forward commitments at December 31, 1995, approximated $6.8 billion. The net replacement value for futures and forward contracts at December 31, 1995, approximated $50.0 million. AIGFP independently evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties, taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized statistical rating organizations. In addition, AIGFP's credit approval process involves pre-set counterparty, country and industry credit exposure limits and, for particularly credit intensive transactions, obtaining approval from AIG's Credit Risk Committee. The average credit rating of AIGFP's counterparties as a whole (as measured by AIGFP) is equivalent to AA. The maximum potential loss will increase or decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (CONTINUED)\\nAIGFP determines counterparty credit quality by reference to ratings from independent rating agencies or internal analysis. At December 31, 1995, the counterparty credit quality by derivative product with respect to the net replacement value of AIGFP's derivatives portfolio was as follows:\\n* Exchange traded futures are not deemed to have significant credit exposure as the exchanges guarantee that every contract will be properly settled on a daily basis. At December 31, 1995, the counterparty breakdown by industry with respect to the net replacement value of AIGFP's derivatives portfolio was as follows:\\n* Exchange traded futures are not deemed to have significant credit exposure as the exchanges guarantee that every contract will be properly settled on a daily basis. AIGFP has entered into commitments to provide liquidity for certain tax exempt variable rate demand notes issued by municipal entities. The agreements allow the holders, in certain circumstances, to tender the notes to the issuer at par value. In the event a remarketing agent of an issuer is unable to resell such tendered notes, AIGFP would be obligated to purchase the notes at par value. With respect to certain notes that have been issued, AIGFP has fulfilled its liquidity commitments by arranging bank liquidity facilities. These banks agree to purchase the notes that AIGFP is otherwise obligated to purchase in connection with a failed remarketing. It is the intention of AIGFP to arrange similar liquidity with respect to the $1.3 billion aggregate amount of notes that are expected to be issued through 1999. In connection with one transaction that has a bank liquidity facility, AIGFP has committed through December 31, 1997 to purchase up to $278.6 million of notes in the event the bank is required to purchase notes under the liquidity facility. Any notes so purchased by AIGFP would be insured as to both principal and interest and, while held by AIGFP, would bear interest at an above-market tax-exempt rate. It is AIGFP's intention, as with existing obligations, to remove itself from this risk through bank participations before the issuance of the underlying notes. Securities sold, but not yet purchased represent obligations of AIGFP to deliver specified securities at their contracted prices, and thereby create a liability to repurchase the securities in the market at prevailing prices. AIGFP monitors and controls its risk exposure on a daily basis through financial, credit and legal reporting systems and, accordingly, believes that it has in place effective procedures for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which it is subject. Management is not aware of any potential counterparty defaults as of December 31, 1995.\"),\n",

The following tables provide the notional and contractual amounts of AIGTG's derivatives portfolio at December 31, 1995. In addition, the estimated positive fair values associated with the derivatives portfolio are also provided and include a maturity profile for the December 31, 1995 balances based upon the expected timing of the future cash flows. The notional amounts used to express the extent of AIGTG's involvement in derivatives transactions represent a standard of measurement of the volume of AIGTG's swaps business. Notional amount is not a quantification of the market or credit risks of the positions and is not necessarily recorded on the balance sheet. Notional amounts represent those amounts used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received, except for certain contracts such as currency swaps. The timing and the amount of cash flows relating to foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures and options contracts are determined by the contractual agreements. Futures and forward contracts are contracts for delivery of foreign currencies, commodities or financial indices in which the seller/purchaser agrees to make/take delivery at a specified future date of a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield. Risks arise as a result of movements in current market prices from contracted prices and the potential inability of counterparties to meet their obligations under the contracts. At December 31, 1995, the contractual amount of AIGTG's futures and forward contracts approximated $210.5 billion. The gross replacement values presented represent the sum of the estimated positive fair values of all of AIGTG's derivatives contracts at December 31, 1995. These values do not represent the credit risk to AIGTG. Net replacement values presented represent the net sum of estimated positive fair values after the application of legally enforceable master closeout netting agreements and collateral held. The net replacement values most closely represent the net credit risk to AIGTG or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss. At December 31, 1995, the net replacement value of AIGTG's futures and forward contracts and interest rate and currency swaps approximated $2.07 billion.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (CONTINUED)\\nOptions are contracts that allow the holder of the option to purchase or sell the underlying commodity, currency or index at a specified price and within, or at, a specified period of time. Risks arise as a result of movements in current market prices from contracted prices, and the potential inability of the counterparties to meet their obligations under the contracts. At December 31, 1995, the contractual amount of AIGTG's purchased options approximated $26.5 billion. As a writer of options, AIGTG generally receives an option premium and then manages the risk of any unfavorable change in the value of the underlying commodity, currency or index. At December 31, 1995, the contractual amount for sold options approximated $28.1 billion. The following table presents AIGTG's options portfolio and the associated credit exposure, if applicable, by maturity and type of derivative at December 31, 1995:\\n(a) The net replacement value with respect to purchased options is presented as a component of spot commodities, at market value.

AIGTG limits its risks by holding offsetting positions. In addition, AIGTG monitors and controls its risk exposures through various monitoring systems which evaluate AIGTG's market and credit risks, and through credit approvals and limits. At December 31, 1995, AIGTG did not have a significant concentration of credit risk from either an individual counterparty or group of counterparties. The net trading revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 1995 from AIGTG's operations were $317.2 million. At December 31, 1995, AIGTG had issued and outstanding $206.0 million principal amount of letters of credit. These letters of credit were issued primarily to various exchanges. AIG has issued unconditional guarantees with respect to the prompt payment, when due, of all present and future obligations and liabilities of AIGFP and AIGTG arising from transactions entered into by AIGFP and AIGTG. (e) At December 31, 1995, ILFC had committed to purchase or had secured positions for 292 aircraft deliverable from 1996 through 2004 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $15.9 billion and had options to purchase an additional 34 aircraft deliverable through 2005 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $2.5 billion. ILFC will be required to find customers for any aircraft presently on order and any aircraft to be ordered, and it must arrange financing for portions of the purchase price of such equipment. AIG does not anticipate any losses in connection with the aforementioned activities that would have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations. (f) AIG and its subsidiaries, in common with the insurance industry in general, are subject to litigation, including claims for punitive damages, in the normal course of their business. AIG does not believe that such litigation will have a material effect on its operating results and financial condition. AIG continues to receive indemnity claims asserting injuries from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites (hereinafter collectively referred to as environmental claims) and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a difficult process, as these claims, which emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years, cannot be estimated by conventional reserving techniques. Asbestos and environmental claims development is affected by factors such as inconsistent court resolutions, the broadening of the intent of policies and scope of coverage and increasing number of new claims. AIG and other industry members have and will continue to litigate the broadening judicial interpretation of policy coverage and the liability issues. If the courts continue in the future to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage, as they have in the past, additional liabilities would emerge for amounts in excess of reserves held. This emergence cannot now be reasonably estimated, but could have a material impact on AIG's future operating results. The reserves carried for these claims as at December 31, 1995 ($1.94 billion gross; $507.2 million net) are believed to be adequate as these reserves are based on known facts and current law.\"),\n",

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\\nStatement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107 \"Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments\" (FASB 107) requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate such fair value. These financial instruments may or may not be recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. In the measurement of the fair value of certain of the financial instruments, quoted market prices were not available and other valuation techniques were utilized. These derived fair value estimates are significantly affected by the assumptions used. FASB 107 excludes certain financial instruments, including those related to insurance contracts. The following methods and assumptions were used by AIG in estimating the fair value of the financial instruments presented:\\nCash and short-term investments: The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for these instruments approximate fair values. Fixed maturity securities: Fair values for fixed maturity securities carried at amortized cost or at market value were generally based upon quoted market prices. For certain fixed maturity securities for which market prices were not readily available, fair values were estimated using values obtained from independent pricing services.

STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS\\nAt December 31, 1995, AIG had two types of stock-based compensation plans. One was a stock option plan; the other, an employee stock purchase plan. AIG applies APB Opinion 25 \"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees\" and related Interpretations in accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no compensation costs have been recognized for either plan. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n13. STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS (CONTINUED)\\n(a) Stock Option Plan:On December 19, 1991, the AIG Board of Directors adopted a 1991 employee stock option plan, which provides that options to purchase a maximum of 4,500,000 shares of common stock could be granted to officers and other key employees at prices not less than fair market value at the date of grant. Both the 1991 plan, and the options with respect to 112,387 shares granted thereunder on December 19, 1991, were approved by shareholders at the 1992 Annual Meeting. At December 31, 1995, 2,099,983 shares were reserved for future grants under the 1991 plan. As of March 18, 1992, no further options could be granted under the 1987 plan, but outstanding options granted under the 1987 plan and the previously superceded 1982 plan continue in force until exercise or expiration. At December 31, 1995, there were 4,130,713 shares reserved for issuance under the 1991, 1987 and 1982 plans. Under each plan, 25 percent of the options granted become exercisable on the anniversary of the date of grant in each of the four years following that grant and all options expire 10 years from the date of the grant. As of December 31, 1995, outstanding options granted with respect to 2,896,132 shares qualified for Incentive Stock Option treatment under the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. Additional information with respect to AIG\\'s plans at December 31, 1995, and changes for the three years then ended, was as follows:\\nInformation about fixed stock options outstanding at December 31, 1995, is summarized as follows:\\nThe fair value of stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 1995 was $18,356,000. The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions were used for grants in 1995: dividend yield of 0.32 percent, expected volatility of 20.4 percent, risk-free interest rate of 5.77 percent, and an expected life of 7 years. (b) Employee Stock Purchase Plan: AIG\\'s 1984 employee stock purchase plan was adopted at its 1984 shareholders\\' meeting and became effective as of July 1, 1984. Eligible employees receive privileges to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,968,750 shares of AIG common stock, at a price equal to 85 percent of the fair market value on the date of grant of the purchase privilege. American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n13. STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS (CONTINUED)\\nPurchase privileges are granted annually and are limited to the number of whole shares that can be purchased by an amount equal to 5 percent of an employee\\'s annual salary or $3,750, whichever is less. Beginning with the January 1, 1996 subscription, the maximum allowable purchase limitation increased to $5,500. As of December 31, 1995, there were 110,641 shares of common stock subscribed to at a weighted average price of $65.20 per share pursuant to grants of privileges under the 1984 plan. There were 152,406 shares, 135,992 shares and 140,171 shares issued under the 1984 plan at weighted average prices of $50.22, $50.37 and $36.31 for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The excess or deficit of the proceeds over the par value or cost of the common stock issued was credited or charged to additional paid-in capital. There were 255,104 shares available for the grant of future purchase privileges under the 1984 plan at December 31, 1995. The fair value of purchase privileges granted during the year ended December 31, 1995 was $2,005,000. The weighted average fair value per share of those purchase rights granted in 1995 was $14.90. The fair value of each purchase right is estimated on the date of the subscription using the Black-Scholes model. The following were weighted average assumptions: dividend yield of 0.32 percent, an expected life of 1 year, expected volatility of 16.9 percent, and a risk-free interest rate of 5.64 percent.'),\n",

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\\n(a) Employees of AIG, its subsidiaries and certain affiliated companies, including employees in foreign countries, are generally covered under various funded and insured pension plans. Eligibility for participation in the various plans is based on either completion of a specified period of continuous service or date of hire, subject to age limitation. While benefits vary, they are usually based on the employees\\' years of credited service and average compensation in the three years preceding retirement. AIG\\'s U.S. retirement plan is a qualified, noncontributory, defined benefit plan. All qualified employees who have attained age 21 and completed twelve months of continuous service are eligible to participate in this plan. An employee with 5 or more years of service is entitled to pension benefits beginning at normal retirement at age 65. Benefits are based upon a percentage of average final compensation multiplied by years of credited service limited to 44 years of credited service. Prior to January 1, 1996, average final compensation was subject to certain limitations. Annual funding requirements are determined based on the \"projected unit credit\" cost method which attributes a pro rata portion of the total projected benefit payable at normal retirement to each year of credited service. AIG has adopted a Supplemental Executive Retirement Program (Supplemental Plan) to provide additional retirement benefits to designated executives and key employees. Under the Supplemental Plan, the annual benefit, not to exceed 60 percent of average final compensation, accrues at a percentage of average final pay multiplied for each year of credited service reduced by any benefits from the current and any predecessor retirement plans, Social Security, if any, and from any qualified pension plan of prior employers. The Supplemental Plan also provides a benefit equal to the reduction in benefits payable under the AIG retirement plan as a result of Federal limitations on benefits payable thereunder. Currently, the Supplemental Plan is unfunded. Eligibility for participation in the various non-U.S. retirement plans is either based on completion of a specified period of continuous service or date of hire, subject to age limitation. While benefits vary, they are generally based on the employees\\' years of credited service and average compensation in the years preceding retirement. Assumptions associated with the projected benefit obligation and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at December 31, 1995 were as follows:\\n* The ranges for the non-U.S. plans reflect the local socioeconomic environments in which AIG operates. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n14. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED)\\nThe following table sets forth the funded status of the various pension plans and the amounts recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 1995 and 1994:\\n* Plan assets are invested primarily in fixed-income securities and listed stocks. Net pension cost for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 included the following components:\\n* Net pension expense included $30,978, $26,727 and $20,999 related to non-U.S. plans for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. (b) AIG sponsors a voluntary savings plan for domestic employees (a 401(k) plan), which, during the two years ended December 31, 1994, provided for salary reduction contributions by employees and matching contributions by AIG of up to 2 percent of annual salary. Commencing January 1, 1995, the 401(k) plan provided for matching contributions by AIG of up to 6 percent of annual salary depending on the employees\\' years of service. (c) In addition to AIG\\'s defined benefit pension plan, AIG and its subsidiaries provide a postretirement benefit program for medical care and life insurance, domestically and in certain foreign countries. Eligibility in the various plans is generally based upon completion of a specified period of eligible service and reaching a specified age. Benefits vary by geographic location. AIG\\'s U.S. postretirement medical and life insurance benefits are based upon the employee reaching age 55 with 10 years of service to be eligible for an immediate benefit from the U.S. retirement plan. Retirees and their dependents who were age 65 by May 1, 1989 participate in the medical plan at no cost. All other retirees and dependents over age 65 pay 50 percent of the premium that is paid by current active employees. Retirees under age 65 pay the full active premium and covered dependents pay twice the active employee amounts. Contributions are subject to adjustment annually. Other cost sharing features of the medical plan include deductibles, coinsurance and Medicare coordination and a lifetime maximum benefit of $1,000,000. The maximum life insurance benefit prior to age 70 is $32,500, with a maximum of $25,000 thereafter. Effective January 1, 1993, both plans\\' provisions were amended. Employees who retire on or after January 1, 1993 are required to pay the actual cost of the medical benefits reduced by a credit which is based upon age and years of serv ice at retirement. The life insurance benefit varies by age at retirement from $5,000 for retirement at ages 55 through 59 to $15,000 for retirement at ages 65 and over. American International Group, Inc.'),\n",

The trend rates remain level thereafter. The following table sets forth the liability for the accrued postretirement benefits of the various plans, and amounts recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 1995 and 1994. These plans are not funded currently. The net periodic postretirement costs for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 included the following components:\\nThe medical trend rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. Increasing each trend rate by 1 percent in each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations as of December 31, 1995 by $5.6 million and the aggregate service and interest cost components of the periodic postretirement benefit costs for 1995 by $502,000.

At December 31, 1998, AIG and its subsidiaries had approximately 48,000 employees. The following table shows the general development of the business of AIG on a consolidated basis, the contributions made to AIG\\'s consolidated revenues and operating income and the assets held, in the periods indicated by its general insurance, life insurance, financial services operations, equity in income of minority-owned insurance companies and other realized capital losses. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 1 and 17 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\n(a) Adjusted underwriting profit is statutory underwriting income adjusted primarily for changes in deferral of acquisition costs. This adjustment is necessary to present the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. (b) Represents the sum of general net premiums earned, life premium income, net investment income, financial services commissions, transaction and other fees, equity in income of minority-owned insurance operations and realized capital gains (losses). In 1997, agency operations were presented as a component of general insurance and for years prior to 1997 agency results have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. The following table shows identifiable assets, revenues and income derived from operations in the United States and Canada and from operations in other countries for the year ended December 31, 1998. (See also Note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nGENERAL INSURANCE OPERATIONS\\nAIG\\'s general insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance. One or more of these companies is licensed to write substantially all of these lines in all states of the United States and in approximately 100 foreign countries. Domestic general insurance operations are comprised of the Domestic Brokerage Group, including the domestic operations of Transatlantic, Personal Lines, including 20th Century Industries (20th Century) and Mortgage Guaranty. Commencing with the third quarter of 1998, Transatlantic and 20th Century were consolidated into AIG\\'s financial statements, as a result of AIG obtaining majority ownership. AIG\\'s primary domestic division is the Domestic Brokerage Group (DBG). DBG\\'s business is derived from brokers in the United States and Canada and is conducted through its general insurance subsidiaries including American Home, National Union, Lexington, Transatlantic and certain other insurance company subsidiaries of AIG. The primary casualty/risk management division of DBG provides insurance and risk management programs for large corporate customers. The AIG Risk Finance division designs and implements creative risk financing alternatives using the insurance and financial services capabilities of AIG. Also included are the operations of New Hampshire and its subsidiaries, which focus specifically on providing AIG products and services through brokers to middle market companies, and regional insurance companies which service the commercial middle market. DBG writes substantially all classes of business insurance accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers. This provides DBG the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to submit business to DBG without the traditional agent-company contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no authority to commit DBG to accept a risk. In addition to writing substantially all classes of business insurance, including large commercial or industrial property insurance, excess liability, inland marine, workers\\' compensation and excess and umbrella coverages, DBG offers many specialized forms of insurance such as directors and officers liability, difference-in-conditions, kidnap-ransom, export credit and political risk, and various types of professional errors and omissions coverages. Lexington writes surplus lines, those risks for which conventional insurance companies do not readily provide insurance coverage, either because of complexity or because the coverage does not lend itself to conventional contracts. AIG engages in mass marketing of personal lines coverages, primarily private passenger auto, through American International Insurance Company and 20th Century. The business of United Guaranty Corporation (\"UGC\") and its subsidiaries is also included in the domestic operations of AIG. The principal business of the UGC subsidiaries is the writing of residential mortgage loan insurance, which is guaranty insurance on conventional first mortgage loans on single-family dwellings and condominiums. Such insurance protects lenders against loss if borrowers default. UGC subsidiaries also write home equity and property improvement loan insurance on loans to finance residential property improvements, alterations and repairs and for other purposes not necessarily related to real estate. UGC had approximately $17 billion of mortgage guarantee risk in-force at December 31, 1998. AIG\\'s Foreign General insurance group accepts risks primarily underwritten through American International Underwriters (\"AIU\"), a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned agencies and insurance companies. The Foreign General insurance group also includes business written by AIG\\'s foreign-based insurance subsidiaries for their own accounts. The Foreign General group uses various marketing methods to write both business and personal lines insurance with certain refinements for local laws, customs and needs. AIU operates in over 70 countries in Asia, the Pacific Rim, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America. Transatlantic\\'s foreign operations are included in this group. During 1998, DBG and the Foreign General insurance group accounted for 54.9 percent and 32.9 percent, respectively, of AIG\\'s net premiums written. AIG\\'s general insurance company subsidiaries worldwide operate primarily by underwriting and accepting any size risk for their direct account and securing reinsurance on that portion of the risk in excess of the limit which they wish to retain. This operating policy differs from that of many insurance companies which will underwrite only up to their net retention limit, thereby requiring the broker or agent to secure commitments from other underwriters for the remainder of the gross risk amount. The following table summarizes general insurance premiums written and earned:\\nThe utilization of reinsurance is closely monitored by an internal reinsurance security committee, consisting of members of AIG\\'s senior management. No single reinsurer is a material reinsurer to AIG nor is AIG\\'s business substantially dependent upon any reinsurance contract. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG is well diversified both in terms of lines of business and geographic locations. Of the general insurance lines of business, workers\\' compensation was approximately 8 percent of AIG\\'s net premiums written. This line is well diversified geographically. The majority of AIG\\'s insurance business is in the casualty classes, which tend to involve longer periods of time for the reporting and settling of claims. This may increase the risk and uncertainty with respect to AIG\\'s loss reserve development. (See also the Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development and Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nLoss and expense ratios of AIG\\'s consolidated general insurance operations are set forth in the following table. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\n* Source: Best\\'s Aggregates & Averages (Stock insurance companies, after dividends to policyholders) and the ratio for 1998 reflects estimated results provided by Conning & Company. During 1998, of the direct general insurance premiums written (gross premiums less return premiums and cancellations, excluding reinsurance assumed and before deducting reinsurance ceded), 12.9 percent and 10.4 percent were written in California and New York, respectively. No other state accounted for more than 5 percent of such premiums. There was no significant adverse effect on AIG\\'s general insurance results of operations from the economic environments in any one state, country or geographic region for the year ended December 31, 1998. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nDISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED NET LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT\\nThe reserve for net losses and loss expenses is exclusive of applicable reinsurance and represents the accumulation of estimates for reported losses (\"case basis reserves\") and provisions for losses incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\"). Losses and loss expenses are charged to income as incurred. AIG discounts certain of its loss reserves which are related to certain workers\\' compensation claims. Loss reserves established with respect to foreign business are set and monitored in terms of the respective local or functional currency. Therefore, no assumption is included for changes in currency rates. (See also Note 1(s) of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nManagement continually reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves through the utilization of a number of analytical reserve development techniques. Through the use of these techniques, management is able to monitor the adequacy of its established reserves and determine appropriate assumptions for inflation. Also, analysis of emerging specific development patterns, such as case reserve redundancies or deficiencies and IBNR emergence, allows management to currently determine any required adjustments. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nThe \"Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development\", which follows, presents the development of net losses and loss expense reserves for calendar years 1988 through 1998. The upper half of the table shows the cumulative amounts paid during successive years related to the opening loss reserves. For example, with respect to the net losses and loss expense reserve of $15.84 billion as of December 31, 1991, by the end of 1998 (seven years later) $14.19 billion had actually been paid in settlement of these net loss reserves. In addition, as reflected in the lower section of the table, the original reserve of $15.84 billion was reestimated to be $17.36 billion at December 31, 1998. This increase from the original estimate would generally be a combination of a number of factors, including reserves being settled for larger amounts than originally estimated.'),\n",

The redundancy (deficiency) depicted in the table, for any particular calendar year, shows the aggregate change in estimates over the period of years subsequent to the calendar year reflected at the top of the respective column heading. For example, the redundancy of $281 million at December 31, 1998 related to December 31, 1997 net losses and loss expense reserves of $21.17 billion represents the cumulative amount by which reserves for 1997 and prior years have developed redundantly during 1998. The reserve for net losses and loss expenses with respect to Transatlantic and 20th Century are only included in the consolidated net losses and loss expenses as of December 31, 1998. No reserve development is presented herein as these operations were not majority owned subsidiaries prior to the third quarter of 1998. Over the past several years, AIG has significantly strengthened its net loss and loss expense reserves with respect to asbestos and environmental losses. This strengthening is the primary cause of the adverse development reflected in certain calendar years in the net loss and loss expense reserves shown in the following table. ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED NET LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT\\nThe following table excludes for each calendar year the net loss and loss expense reserves and the development thereof with respect to asbestos and environmental claims. Thus, AIG\\'s loss and loss expense reserves excluding asbestos and environmental claims are developing adequately. (See also management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial condition and Results of Operations.)\\n(a) Acquisitions include the opening balances with respect to Transatlantic and 20th Century. (b) Does not include the effects of foreign exchange adjustments which are reflected in the \"Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development\" table. Approximately 45 percent of the net losses and loss expense reserves are paid out within two years of the date incurred. The remaining net losses and loss expense reserves, particularly those associated with the casualty lines of business, may extend to 20 years or more. For further discussion regarding net reserves for losses and loss expenses, see Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The reserve for losses and loss expenses as reported in AIG\\'s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 1998, differs from the total reserve reported in the Annual Statements filed with state insurance departments and, where appropriate, with foreign regulatory authorities. The differences at December 31, 1998 relate primarily to estimates for unrecoverable reinsurance and additional reserves relating to certain foreign operations. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nThe reserve for gross losses and loss expenses is prior to reinsurance and represents the accumulation for reported losses and\\nIBNR. Management reviews the adequacy of established gross loss reserves in the manner previously described for net loss reserves.

LIFE INSURANCE OPERATIONS\\nAIG's life insurance subsidiaries offer a wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment products. One or more of these subsidiaries is licensed to write life insurance in all states in the United States and in over 70 foreign countries. Traditional products consist of individual and group life, annuity, endowment and accident and health policies. Financial and investment products consist of single premium annuity, variable annuities, guaranteed investment contracts, universal life and pensions. (See also Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nLife insurance operations in foreign countries comprised 92.8 percent of life premium income and 91.6 percent of operating income in 1998. AIG operates overseas principally through American Life Insurance Company (ALICO), American International Assurance Company, Limited together with American International Assurance Company (Bermuda) Limited (AIA) and Nan Shan Life Insurance Company, Ltd. (Nan Shan). ALICO is incorporated in Delaware and all of its business is written outside of the United States. ALICO has operations either directly or through subsidiaries in approximately 50 countries located in Europe, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and the Far East, with Japan being the largest territory. AIA operates primarily in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. Nan Shan operates in Taiwan. These operations comprised 90.4 percent of AIG's consolidated life premium income. (See also Note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nIn the United States, AIG has four domestic life subsidiaries: American International Life Assurance Company of New York, AIG Life Insurance Company, Delaware American Life Insurance Company, and Pacific Union Assurance Company. These companies utilize multiple distribution channels including brokerage and career and general agents to offer primarily life insurance, financial and investment products and specialty forms of accident and health coverage for individuals and groups, including employee benefit plans. The domestic life business comprised 7.2 percent of total life premium income in 1998. There was no significant adverse effect on AIG's life insurance results of operations from economic environments in any one state, country or geographic region for the year ended December 31, 1998. (See also Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nTraditional life insurance products such as whole life and endowment continue to be significant in the overseas companies, especially in Southeast Asia, while a mixture of traditional, accident and health and financial products are sold in Japan. In addition to the above, AIG also has subsidiary operations in Switzerland, Puerto Rico, and conducts life insurance business through AIUO subsidiary companies in certain countries in Central and South America. The foreign life companies have approximately 120,000 career agents and sell their products largely to indigenous persons in local currencies. In addition to the agency outlets, these companies also distribute their products through direct marketing channels, such as mass marketing, and through brokers and other distribution outlets such as financial institutions. The following table summarizes the life insurance operating results for the year ended December 31, 1998. (See also Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\n(a) Including income related to investment type products. (b) Including $266.8 billion of whole life insurance and endowments. (c) Not applicable. AIG's individual life insurance and group life insurance portfolio accounted for 71 percent, 69 percent and 68 percent of AIG's consolidated life insurance operating income before realized capital gains or losses for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. For each of those years, 92 percent of consolidated life operating income before realized capital gains or losses was derived from foreign operations. INSURANCE INVESTMENT OPERATIONS\\nA significant portion of AIG's general and life operating revenues are derived from AIG's insurance investment operations.

AIG's worldwide insurance investment policy places primary emphasis on investments in high quality, fixed income securities in all of its portfolios and, to a lesser extent, investments in marketable common stocks in order to preserve policyholders' surplus and generate net investment income. The ability to implement this policy is somewhat limited in certain territories as there may be a lack of qualified long term investments or investment restrictions may be imposed by the local regulatory authorities. (See also Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nFINANCIAL SERVICES OPERATIONS\\nAIG's financial services subsidiaries engage in diversified financial products and services including asset management, premium financing, banking services and consumer finance services. International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) engages primarily in the acquisition of new and used commercial jet aircraft and the leasing and remarketing of such aircraft to airlines around the world.

ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS\\nOn January 29, 1998, AIG purchased the 76.1 percent interest in SELIC Holdings, Ltd. which it previously did not own. AIG holds a 24.4 percent interest in IPC Holdings, Ltd., a reinsurance holding company and a 19.9 percent interest in Richmond Insurance Company, Ltd., a reinsurer. (See also Note 1(n) of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nLOCATIONS OF CERTAIN ASSETS\\nAs of December 31, 1998, approximately 39 percent of the consolidated assets of AIG were located in foreign countries (other than Canada), including $1.02 billion of cash and securities on deposit with foreign regulatory authorities. Foreign operations and assets held abroad may be adversely affected by political developments in foreign countries, including such possibilities as tax changes, nationalization and changes in regulatory policy, as well as by consequence of hostilities and unrest. The risks of such occurrences and their overall effect upon AIG vary from country to country and cannot easily be predicted. If expropriation or nationalization does occur, AIG's policy is to take all appropriate measures to seek recovery of such assets. Certain of the countries in which AIG's business is conducted have currency restrictions which generally cause a delay in a company's ability to repatriate assets and profits. (See also Notes 1, 2 and 17 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nINSURANCE REGULATION AND COMPETITION\\nCertain states require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies which are licensed in such states and are controlled by other corporations. Applicable legislation typically requires periodic disclosure concerning the corporation which controls the registered insurer and the other companies in the holding company system and prior approval of intercorporate transfers of assets (including in some instances payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiary) within the holding company system. AIG's subsidiaries are registered under such legislation in those states which have such requirements. (See also Note 10 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG's insurance subsidiaries, in common with other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and by other jurisdictions in which they do business. Within the United States, the method of such regulation varies but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory and supervisory powers to an insurance official. The regulation and supervision relate primarily to approval of policy forms and rates, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, including risk based capital measurements, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on investments, restrictions on the size of risks which may be insured under a single policy, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, methods of accounting, periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies, the form and content of reports of financial condition\\nrequired to be filed, and reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than security holders. (See also Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nRisk Based Capital (RBC) is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. Thus, inadequately capitalized general and life insurance companies may be identified. The RBC formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. Higher factors are applied to more risky items and lower factors are applied to less risky items. Thus, the target level of statutory surplus varies not only as a result of the insurer's size, but also on the risk profile of the insurer's operations. The RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control. The statutory surplus of each of AIG's domestic general and life insurance subsidiaries exceeded their RBC standards by considerable margins as of December 31, 1998. To the extent that any of AIG's insurance entities would fall below prescribed levels of surplus, it would be AIG's intention to infuse necessary capital to support that entity. A substantial portion of AIG's general insurance business and a majority of its life insurance business is carried on in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies from minimal in some to stringent in others. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification or revocation by such authorities, and AIU or other AIG subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. In the past, AIU has been allowed to modify its operations to conform with new licensing requirements in most jurisdictions. In addition to licensing requirements, AIG's foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, policy language and terms, amount and type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of local investment and the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on participating policies. Some foreign countries regulate rates in various types of policies. Certain countries have established reinsurance institutions, wholly or partially owned by the state, to which admitted insurers are obligated to cede a portion of their business on terms which do not always allow foreign insurers, including AIG, full compensation. In some countries, regulations governing constitution of technical reserves and remittance balances may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets. The insurance industry is highly competitive. Within the United States, AIG's general insurance subsidiaries compete with approximately 3,000 other stock companies, specialty insurance organizations, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations. AIG's life insurance companies compete in the United States with some 1,700 life insurance companies and other participants in related financial service fields. Overseas, AIG subsidiaries compete for business with foreign insurance operations of the larger U.S. insurers and local companies in particular areas in which they are active. AIG's financial services subsidiaries, particularly AIGTG and AIGFP, operate in a highly competitive environment, both domestically and overseas. Principal sources of competition are banks, investment banks and other non-bank financial institutions.\"),\n",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\", 'filename': '5272_1998.txt', 'cik': '0000005272', 'year': 1998, 'chunk_index': 0}, page_content='ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\nOPERATIONAL REVIEW\\nGENERAL INSURANCE OPERATIONS\\nAIG\\'s general insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance. One or more of these companies is licensed to write substantially all of these lines in all states of the United States and in approximately 100 foreign countries. Domestic general insurance operations are comprised of the Domestic Brokerage Group, including the domestic operations of Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (Transatlantic), Personal Lines, including 20th Century Industries (20th Century) and Mortgage Guaranty. Commencing with the third quarter of 1998, Transatlantic and 20th Century were consolidated into AIG\\'s financial statements, as a result of AIG obtaining majority ownership. The Domestic Brokerage Group (DBG) is the primary domestic division. DBG writes substantially all classes of business insurance accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers. This provides DBG the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to submit business to DBG without the traditional agent-company contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no authority to commit DBG to accept a risk. AIG\\'s Foreign General insurance group accepts risks primarily underwritten through American International Underwriters (AIU), a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned agencies and insurance entities. The Foreign General insurance group also includes business written by AIG\\'s foreign-based insurance subsidiaries for their own accounts. The Foreign General group uses various marketing methods to write both business and personal lines insurance with certain refinements for local laws, customs and needs. AIU operates in over 70 countries in Asia, the Pacific Rim, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America. Transatlantic\\'s foreign operations are included in this group. (See also Note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nGeneral insurance operations for the twelve month periods ending December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 were as follows:\\nIn AIG\\'s general insurance operations, 1998 net premiums written and net premiums earned increased 8.8 percent and 13.5 percent, respectively, from those of 1997. In 1997, net premiums written increased 5.6 percent and net premiums earned increased 4.8 percent when compared to 1996. The commercial insurance market remains highly competitive and excessively capitalized. DBG has been able to sustain some growth in various specialty markets. However, DBG has also non-renewed certain of its policies where underwriting and pricing standards could not be achieved. Domestic growth was primarily achieved through the growth in the personal auto insurance segment of Personal Lines. Foreign general insurance operations produced 32.9 percent of the general insurance net premiums written in 1998, 32.6 percent in 1997 and 34.1 percent in 1996. In comparing the foreign exchange rates used to translate the results of the Foreign General insurance group\\'s operations during 1998 to those foreign exchange rates used to translate the Foreign General insurance group\\'s results during 1997, the U.S. dollar strengthened in value in relation to most major foreign currencies in which the Foreign General insurance group conducts its business. Accordingly, if the Foreign General insurance group\\'s net premiums written were translated into U.S. dollars utilizing those exchange rates which prevailed in 1997, thus mitigating the effects of the U.S. dollar\\'s general strengthening, the Foreign General insurance group\\'s premium\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\ngrowth would have been 17.5 percent. This growth equates to growth in original currency. The Far East operations, particularly personal lines, were the primary source for such growth. (See also the discussion under \"Capital Resources\" herein.)\\nNet premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies. The net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period. Thus, the net unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized as net premiums earned until the end of the policy period. The statutory general insurance ratios were as follows:\\nAdjusted underwriting profit (operating income less net investment income and realized capital gains) represents statutory underwriting profit or loss adjusted primarily for changes in deferred policy acquisition costs. The adjusted underwriting profits were $531 million in 1998, $490 million in 1997 and $450 million in 1996. (See also Notes 4 and 17 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG\\'s results reflect the net impact of incurred losses from catastrophes approximating $110 million in 1998, $16 million in 1997 and $78 million in 1996. AIG\\'s gross incurred losses from catastrophes approximated $625 million in 1998, $22 million in 1997 and $240 million in 1996. If these catastrophes were excluded from the losses incurred in each period, the pro forma consolidated statutory general insurance ratios would be as follows:\\nAIG\\'s ability to maintain its combined ratio below 100 is primarily attributable to the profitability of AIG\\'s foreign general insurance operations and AIG\\'s emphasis on maintaining its disciplined underwriting, especially in the domestic specialty markets. In addition, AIG does not seek net premium growth where rates do not adequately reflect its assessment of exposures. General insurance net investment income in 1998 increased 18.3 percent when compared to 1997. In 1997, net investment income increased 9.6 percent over 1996. The growth in net investment income in each of the three years was primarily attributable to new cash flow for investment. The new cash flow was generated from net general insurance operating cash flow and included the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income. (See also the discussion under \"Liquidity\" herein and Note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nGeneral insurance realized capital gains were $205 million in 1998, $128 million in 1997 and $65 million in 1996. These realized gains resulted from the ongoing management of the general insurance investment portfolios within the overall objectives of the general insurance operations and arose primarily from the disposition of equity securities and available for sale fixed maturities as well as redemptions of fixed maturities. General insurance operating income in 1998 increased 18.4 percent when compared to 1997. The 1997 results reflect an increase of 12.1 percent from 1996. The contribution of general insurance operating income to income before income taxes and minority interest was 53.0 percent in 1998 compared to 52.3 percent in 1997 and 54.4 percent in 1996. AIG is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its general insurance operations. AIG is cognizant of the need to exercise good judgment in the selection and approval of both domestic and foreign companies participating in its reinsurance programs. AIG insures risks in over 100 countries and its reinsurance programs must be coordinated in order to provide AIG the level of reinsurance protection that AIG desires. These reinsurance arrangements do not relieve AIG from its direct obligations to its insureds. AIG\\'s general reinsurance assets amounted to $17.61 billion and resulted from AIG\\'s reinsurance arrangements. Thus, a credit exposure existed at December 31, 1998 with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer may not be able to reimburse AIG under the terms of these reinsurance arrangements. AIG manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound, and when necessary AIG holds substantial collateral in the form of funds, securities and/or irrevocable letters of credit. This collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods on an individual reinsurer basis. At December 31, 1998, approximately 50 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from unauthorized reinsurers. In order to obtain statutory recognition, nearly all of these balances were collateralized. The remaining 50 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from authorized reinsurers and over 93 percent of such balances are from reinsurers rated A-(excellent) or better, as rated by A.M.

At December 31, 1998, the consolidated general reinsurance assets of $17.61 billion include reinsurance recoverables for paid losses and loss expenses of $1.72 billion and $13.69 billion with respect to the ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses, including ceded losses incurred but not reported (IBNR) (ceded reserves). The ceded reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate ceded losses including provisions for ceded IBNR and loss expenses. The methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting ceded reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments therefrom are reflected in income currently. It is AIG's belief that the ceded reserves at December 31, 1998 were representative of the ultimate losses recoverable. In the future, as the ceded reserves continue to develop to ultimate amounts, the ultimate loss recoverable may be greater or less than the reserves currently ceded. At December 31, 1998, general insurance reserves for losses and loss expenses (loss reserves) amounted to $38.31 billion. These loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including IBNR, and loss expenses and minor amounts of discounting related to certain workers' compensation claims. At December 31, 1998, general insurance net loss reserves increased $3.45 billion to $24.62 billion. These loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverable, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance. The methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in operating income currently. It is management's belief that the general insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover all general insurance net losses and loss expenses as at December 31, 1998. In the future, if the general insurance net loss reserves develop deficiently, such deficiency would have an adverse impact on such future results of operations. In a very broad sense, the general loss reserves can be categorized into two distinct groups: one group being long tail casualty lines of business; the other being short tail lines of business consisting principally of property lines and including certain classes of casualty lines. Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses (net losses) for long tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the line and volume of the business involved. In the more recent accident years of long tail casualty lines there is limited statistical credibility in reported net losses. That is, a relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims and expenses and an even smaller proportion would be net losses paid. A relatively high proportion of net losses would therefore be IBNR. A variety of actuarial methods and assumptions are normally employed to estimate net losses for long tail casualty lines. These methods ordinarily involve the use of loss trend factors intended to reflect the estimated annual growth in loss costs from one accident year to the next. For the majority of long tail casualty lines, net loss trend factors approximated six percent. Loss trend factors reflect many items including changes in claims handling, exposure and policy forms and current and future estimates of monetary inflation and social inflation. Thus, many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the year to year growth in loss costs. Therefore, AIG's carried net long tail loss reserves are judgmentally set as well as tested for reasonableness using the most appropriate loss trend factors for each class of business. In the evaluation of AIG's net loss reserves, loss trend factors vary slightly, depending on the particular class and nature of the business involved. These factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss experience. Estimation of net losses for short tail business is less complex than for long tail casualty lines. Loss cost trends for many property lines can generally be assumed to be similar to the growth in exposure of such lines. For example, if the fire insurance coverage remained proportional to the actual value of the property, the growth in property's exposure to fire loss can be approximated by the amount of insurance purchased. For other property and short tail casualty lines, the loss trend is implicitly assumed to grow at the rate that reported net losses grow from one year to the next. The concerns noted above for longer tail casualty lines with respect to the limited statistical credibility of reported net losses generally do not apply to shorter tail lines. AIG continues to receive claims asserting injuries from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites (hereinafter referred to collectively as environmental claims) and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. The vast majority of these asbestos and\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nenvironmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. AIG has established a specialized claims unit which investigates and adjusts all such asbestos and environmental claims. Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained an absolute exclusion for pollution related damage. However, AIG currently underwrites environmental impairment liability insurance on a claims made basis and excluded such claims from the analyses included herein. Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a difficult process. These asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated by conventional reserving techniques as previously described. Quantitative techniques frequently have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including managerial judgment. Significant factors which affect the trends which influence the development of asbestos and environmental claims are the inconsistent court resolutions and judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage. The current case law can be characterized as still evolving and there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop in the near future.\"),\n",

The cleanup cost exposure may significantly change if the Congressional reauthorization of Superfund dramatically changes, thereby reducing or increasing litigation and cleanup costs. Additionally, proposed legislation, if passed in current form, would be expected to reduce ultimate asbestos exposure. In the interim, AIG and other industry members have and will continue to litigate the broadening judicial interpretation of the policy coverage and the liability issues. At the current time, it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the same degree of reliability as is the case for other types of claims. Such development will be affected by the extent to which courts continue to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage, as they have in the past, as well as by changes in Superfund and waste dump site coverage issues. Although the estimated liabilities for these claims are subject to a significantly greater margin of error than for other claims, the reserves carried for these claims at December 31, 1998 are believed to be adequate as these reserves are based on the known facts and current law. Furthermore, as AIG's net exposure retained relative to the gross exposure written was lower in 1984 and prior years, the potential impact of these claims is much smaller on the net loss reserves than on the gross loss reserves. (See the previous discussion on reinsurance collectibility herein.)\\nThe majority of AIG's exposures for asbestos and environmental claims are excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. Thus, the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity reserves. That is, litigation expenses are included within the limits of the liability AIG incurs. Individual significant claim liabilities, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case basis.

Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have significant impact on the amount of asbestos and environmental losses and loss expense reserves, ultimate payments thereof and the resultant ratio. The developed survival ratios include both involuntary and voluntary indemnity payments. Involuntary payments include court judgments, court orders, covered claims with no coverage defenses, state mandated cleanup costs, claims where AIG's coverage defenses are minimal, and settlements made less than six months before the first trial setting. Also, AIG considers all legal and loss adjustment payments as involuntary. AIG believes voluntary indemnity payments should be excluded from the survival ratio.

(See also the discussions under \"Capital Resources,\" \"Liquidity\" and \"Derivatives\" herein and Note 17 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nIn December 1997, AIGTG sold its energy operations. The sale of these operations did not have a significant impact on AIG\\'s results of operations. OTHER OPERATIONS\\nIn 1998, AIG\\'s equity in income of minority-owned insurance operations was $57 million compared to $114 million in 1997 and $99 million in 1996. In 1998, the equity interest in insurance companies represented 1.0 percent of income before income taxes and minority interest compared to 2.4 percent in both 1997 and 1996. The decrease in income of minority-owned insurance operations from 1997 to 1998, resulted primarily from the consolidation of Transatlantic\\'s operations into general insurance operating results. In addition, SELIC Holdings, Ltd. was consolidated earlier this year. IPC Holdings, Ltd., the remaining operation included in equity in income of minority-owned insurance operations in previous periods is now reported as a component of other income (deductions) - net. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nOther realized capital losses amounted to $5 million, $30 million and $12 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Other income (deductions)-net includes AIG\\'s equity in certain minor majority-owned subsidiaries and certain partially-owned companies, realized foreign exchange transaction gains and losses in substantially all currencies and unrealized gains and losses in hyperinflationary currencies, costs associated with the Year 2000 computer issues, as well as the income and expenses of the parent holding company and other miscellaneous income and expenses. In 1998, net deductions amounted to $144 million. In 1997 and 1996, net deductions amounted to $97 million and $85 million, respectively. (See also the discussion under \"Recent Developments\" herein.)\\nIncome before income taxes and minority interest amounted to $5.53 billion in 1998, $4.73 billion in 1997 and $4.06 billion in 1996. In 1998, AIG recorded a provision for income taxes of $1.59 billion compared to the provisions of $1.37 billion and $1.12 billion in 1997 and 1996, respectively. These provisions represent effective tax rates of 28.8 percent in 1998, 28.9 percent in 1997 and 27.5 percent in 1996. (See Note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nMinority interest represents minority shareholders\\' equity in income of certain majority-owned consolidated subsidiaries. Minority interest amounted to $169 million, $32 million and $43 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The increase in 1998 from 1997 was primarily related to the minority shareholders\\' equity resulting when Transatlantic and 20th Century were consolidated during 1998. Net income amounted to $3.77 billion in 1998, $3.33 billion in 1997 and $2.90 billion in 1996.'),\n",

The Facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and also provide backup for AIG\\'s commercial paper programs administered by Funding. There are currently no borrowings outstanding under either of the Facilities, nor were any borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 1998. At December 31, 1998, ILFC had increased the aggregate principal amount outstanding of its medium term and term notes to $7.17 billion, a net increase of $326 million, and recorded a net decline in its capital lease obligations of $93 million and a net increase in its commercial paper of $996 million. At December 31, 1998, ILFC had $565 million in aggregate principal amount of debt securities registered for issuance from time to time. Through March 15, 1999, ILFC reduced this registered amount to $100 million through the sale of debt securities amounting to $465 million aggregate principal amount. Also, in March 1999, ILFC registered $2.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of debt securities for issuance from time to time. At that time, the aggregate principal amount of registered debt available for issuance was $2.1 billion. The proceeds of ILFC\\'s debt financing are primarily used to purchase flight equipment, including progress payments during the construction phase. The primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are the cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of flight equipment and the rollover and refinancing of the prior debt.

Retained earnings increased $2.59 billion, resulting from net income less dividends. During 1998, AIG repurchased 1,044,750 shares of its common stock in the open market at a cost of $77 million. Shares repurchased prior to July 31, 1998, have been adjusted for the three for two stock split in the form of a 50 percent common stock dividend. AIG intends to continue to buy its common shares in the open market to satisfy its obligations under various employee benefit plans. Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by statutory authorities. AIG has in the past reinvested most of its unrestricted earnings in its operations and believes such continued reinvestment in the future will be adequate to meet any foreseeable capital needs. However, AIG may choose from time to time to raise additional funds through the issuance of additional securities. At December 31, 1998, there were no significant statutory or regulatory issues which would impair AIG\\'s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. To AIG\\'s knowledge, no AIG company is on any regulatory or similar \"watch list\". (See also the discussion under \"Liquidity\" herein and Note 10 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has developed Risk-Based Capital (RBC) requirements. RBC relates an individual insurance company\\'s statutory surplus to the risk inherent in its overall operations. At December 31, 1998, the adjusted capital of each of AIG\\'s domestic general companies and of each of AIG\\'s domestic life companies exceeded each of their RBC standards by considerable margins. A substantial portion of AIG\\'s general insurance business and a majority of its life insurance business are conducted in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies from minimal in some to stringent in others. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. LIQUIDITY\\nAIG\\'s liquidity is primarily derived from the operating cash flows of its general and life insurance operations. At December 31, 1998, AIG\\'s consolidated invested assets included $5.25 billion of cash and short-term investments. Consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in 1998 amounted to $7.04 billion. Sources of funds considered in meeting the objectives of AIG\\'s financial services operations include guaranteed investment agreements, issuance of long and short-term debt, maturities and sales of securities available for sale, securities sold under repurchase agreements, trading liabilities, securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased, issuance of equity, and cash provided from such operations. AIG\\'s strong capital position is integral to managing this liquidity, as it enables AIG to raise funds in diverse markets worldwide. (See also the discussions under \"Capital Resources\" herein.)\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nManagement believes that AIG\\'s liquid assets, its net cash provided by operations, and access to the capital markets will enable it to meet any foreseeable cash requirements. The liquidity of the combined insurance operations is derived both domestically and abroad. The combined insurance operating cash flow is derived from two sources, underwriting operations and investment operations. In the aggregate, AIG\\'s insurance operations generated approximately $12 billion in pre-tax cash flow during 1998. Cash flow includes periodic premium collections, including policyholders\\' contract deposits, paid loss recoveries less reinsurance premiums, losses, benefits, acquisition and operating expenses. Generally, there is a time lag from when premiums are collected and, when as a result of the occurrence of events specified in the policy, the losses and benefits are paid. AIG\\'s insurance investment operations generated approximately $5.6 billion in investment income cash flow during 1998. Investment income cash flow is primarily derived from interest and dividends received and includes realized capital gains net of realized capital losses. In addition to the combined insurance pre-tax operating cash flow, AIG\\'s insurance operations held $4.91 billion in cash and short-term investments at December 31, 1998. The aforementioned operating cash flow and the cash and short-term balances held provided AIG\\'s insurance operations with a significant amount of liquidity. This liquidity is available, among other things, to purchase high quality and diversified fixed income securities and to a lesser extent marketable equity securities and to provide mortgage loans on real estate, policy loans and collateral loans. This cash flow coupled with proceeds of approximately $20 billion from the maturities, sales and redemptions of fixed income securities and from the sale of equity securities was used to purchase approximately $26 billion of fixed income securities and marketable equity securities during 1998.

Generally, insurance regulations restrict the types of assets in which an insurance company may invest. With respect to fixed maturities, AIG\\'s general strategy is to invest in high quality securities while maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure to issuer, industry and/or country concentrations. With respect to general insurance, AIG\\'s strategy is to invest in longer duration fixed maturities to maximize the yields at the date of purchase. With respect to life insurance, AIG\\'s strategy is to produce cash flows required to meet maturing insurance liabilities (See also the discussion under \"Operational Review: Life Insurance Operations\" herein.)\\nThe fixed maturity available for sale portfolio is subject to decline in fair value as interest rates rise. Such declines in fair value are presented as a component of capital funds in unrealized appreciation of investments, net of taxes. The fixed maturities held to maturity portfolio is exposed to adverse interest rate fluctuations. However, AIG has the ability and intent to hold such securities to maturity. Therefore, there would be no detrimental impact to AIG\\'s results of operations or financial condition as a result of such fluctuations. At December 31, 1998, approximately 52.6 percent of the fixed maturities investments were domestic securities. Approximately 39 percent of such domestic securities were rated AAA. Approximately 11 percent were below investment grade or not rated. A significant portion of the foreign insurance fixed income portfolio is rated by Moody\\'s, Standard & Poor\\'s (S&P) or similar foreign services. Similar credit quality rating services are not available in all overseas locations. AIGannually reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio nonrated fixed income investments, including mortgages. At December 31, 1998, approximately 17 percent of the foreign fixed income investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of AIG\\'s internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities so rated. Approximately 15 percent were below investment grade or not rated at that date. The decline in credit worthiness results not from a change in investment policy but rather from economic turmoil, particularly in Southeast Asia. A large portion of these fixed maturity securities are sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting the policy liabilities in the country of issuance.'),\n",

CMOs are exposed to interest rate risk as the duration and ultimate realized yield would be affected by the accelerated prepayments of the underlying mortgages. There were no interest only or principal only CMOs at December 31, 1998. Any fixed income security may be subject to downgrade for a variety of reasons subsequent to any balance sheet date. There have been no significant downgrades as of March 1, 1999. AIG invests in equities for reasons including diversifying its overall exposure to interest rate risk. Equity securities are subject to declines in fair value. Such declines in fair value are presented as components of capital funds in unrealized appreciation of investments, net of taxes. Mortgage loans on real estate, policy and collateral loans comprised 7.4 percent of AIG's insurance invested assets at December 31, 1998. AIG's insurance operations' holdings of real estate mortgages amounted to $2.76 billion of which 36.7 percent was domestic. At December 31, 1998, no domestic mortgages and only a nominal amount of foreign mortgages were in default. It is AIG's practice to maintain a maximum loan to value ratio of 75 percent at loan origination. At December 31, 1998, AIG's insurance holdings of collateral loans amounted to $1.16 billion, all of which were foreign. It is AIG's strategy to enter into mortgage and collateral loans as an adjunct primarily to life insurance fixed maturity investments.

When permitted by regulatory authorities and when deemed necessary to protect insurance assets, including invested assets, from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, AIGand its insurance subsidiaries may enter into derivative transactions as end users. To date, such activities have not been significant. (See also the discussion under \"Derivatives\" herein.)\\nIn certain jurisdictions, significant regulatory and/or foreign governmental barriers exist which may not permit the immediate free flow of funds between insurance subsidiaries or from the insurance subsidiaries to AIG parent. These barriers generally cause only minor delays in the outward remittance of the funds. AIG\\'s insurance operations are exposed to market risk. Market risk is the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices. Measuring potential losses in fair values has recently become the focus of risk management efforts by many companies. Such measurements are performed through the application of various statistical techniques. One such technique is Value at Risk (VaR). VaR is a summary statistical measure that uses historical interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices and estimates the volatility and correlation of each of these rates and prices to calculate the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time given a certain probability. AIG believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk. While VaR models are relatively sophisticated, the quantitative market risk information generated is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related models. Therefore, such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management. AIG has performed a VaR analysis to estimate the maximum potential loss of fair value for each of AIG\\'s insurance segments and for each market risk within each insurance segment. In this analysis, financial instrument assets include the domestic and foreign invested assets excluding real estate and investment income due and accrued. Financial instrument liabilities include reserve for losses and loss expenses, reserve for unearned premiums, future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and policyholders\\' funds. Due to the nature of each insurance segment, AIG manages the general and life insurance operations separately. As a result, AIG manages separately the invested assets of each. Accordingly, the VaR analysis was separately performed for the general and the life insurance operations. AIG calculated the VaR with respect to the net fair value of each of AIG\\'s insurance segments as of December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997. These calculations used the variance-covariance (delta-normal) methodology.'),\n",

The primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are the cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of flight equipment and the rollover and refinancing of the prior debt. During 1998, ILFC acquired flight equipment costing $3.16 billion. At December 31, 1998, ILFC had committed to purchase or had secured positions for 303 aircraft deliverable from 1999 through 2006 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $17.4 billion. As of March 15, 1999, ILFC has entered into leases, letters of intent to lease or is in various stages of negotiation for all of the aircraft to be delivered in 1999 and 57 of 247 aircraft to be delivered subsequent to 1999. ILFC will be required to find customers for any aircraft presently on order and any aircraft to be ordered, and it must arrange financing for portions of the purchase price of such equipment. In a rising interest rate environment, ILFC negotiates higher lease rates on any new contracts. ILFC has been successful to date both in placing its new aircraft on lease or under sales contract and obtaining adequate financing. ILFC is exposed to market risk and the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates. As of December 31, 1998, AIG statistically measured the aforementioned loss of fair value through the application of a VaR model. In this analysis, the net fair value of ILFC was determined using the financial instrument assets which included the tax adjusted future flight equipment lease revenue and the financial instrument liabilities which included the future servicing of the current debt. The estimated impact of the current derivative positions was also taken into account. AIG calculated the VaR with respect to the net fair value of ILFC using the variance-covariance (delta-normal) methodology. This calculation also used daily historical interest rates for the two years ending December 31, 1998. The VaR model estimated the volatility of each of these interest rates and the correlation among them. The yield curve was constructed using eleven key points on the curve to model possible curve movements. Thus, the VaR measured the sensitivity of the assets and liabilities to the calculated interest rate exposures.

Securities purchased under agreements to resell are treated as collateralized transactions. AIGFP takes possession of or obtains a security interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell. AIGFP further minimizes its credit risk by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and, when AIGFP deems necessary, it requires additional collateral to be deposited. Trading securities, at market value are marked to market daily and are held to meet the short-term risk management objectives of AIGFP. AIGTG conducts, as principal, market making and trading activities in foreign exchange, interest rates and precious and base metals. AIGTG owns inventories in the commodities in which it trades and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the use of swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts. AIGTG uses derivatives to manage the economic exposure of its various trading positions and transactions from adverse movements of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. AIGTG supports its trading activities largely through trading liabilities, unrealized losses on swaps, short-term borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities and commodities sold but not yet purchased. (See also the discussions under \"Capital Resources\" and \"Derivatives\" herein.)\\nThe gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses of AIGFP and AIGTG included in the financial services assets and liabilities at December 31, 1998 were as follows:\\n(a) See also Note 8 (e) of Notes to Financial Statements. (b) These amounts are also presented as the respective balance sheet amounts. (c) At December 31, 1998, AIGTG\\'s replacement values with respect to interest rate and currency swaps were $642 million. AIGFP\\'s interest rate and currency risks on securities available for sale, at market, are managed by taking offsetting positions on a security by security basis, thereby offsetting a significant portion of the unrealized appreciation or depreciation. At December 31, 1998, the unrealized gains and losses remaining after the benefit of the offsets were $43 million and $35 million, respectively. Trading securities, at market value, and securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased, at market value are marked to market daily with the unrealized gain or loss being recognized in income at that time. These securities are held to meet the short-term risk management objectives of AIGFP and AIGTG. The senior management of AIG defines the policies and establishes general operating parameters for AIGFP and AIGTG. AIG\\'s senior management has established various oversight committees to review the various financial market, operational and credit issues of AIGFP and AIGTG. The senior managements of AIGFP and AIGTG report the results of their respective operations to and review future strategies with AIG\\'s senior management. AIG actively manages the exposures to limit potential losses, while maximizing the rewards afforded by these business opportunities. In doing so, AIG must manage a variety of exposures including credit, market, liquidity, operational and legal risks. Market risk arises principally from the uncertainty that future earnings are exposed to potential changes in volatility, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices. AIG generally controls its exposure to market risk by taking offsetting positions. AIG\\'s philosophy with respect to its financial services operations is to minimize or set limits for open or uncovered positions that are to be carried. Credit risk exposure is separately managed. (See the discussion on the management of credit risk below.)\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nAIG\\'s Market Risk Management Department provides detailed independent review of AIG\\'s market exposures, particularly those market exposures of AIGFP and AIGTG. This department determines whether AIG\\'s market risks, as well as those market risks of individual subsidiaries, are within the parameters established by AIG\\'s senior management. Well established market risk management techniques such as sensitivity analysis are used. Additionally, this department verifies that specific market risks of each of certain subsidiaries are managed and hedged by that subsidiary. AIGFP is exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of interest rates and the shape and slope of the yield curve. AIGFP hedges its exposure to interest rate risk by entering into transactions such as interest rate swaps and options and purchasing U.S. and foreign government obligations. AIGFP is exposed to market risk due to changes in and volatility of foreign currency exchange rates. AIGFP hedges its foreign currency exchange risk primarily through the use of currency swaps, options, forwards and futures. AIGFP is exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of equity prices which affect the value of securities or instruments that derive their value from a particular stock, a basket of stocks or a stock index. AIGFP reduces the risk of loss inherent in its inventory in equity securities by entering into hedging transactions, including equity swaps and options and purchasing U.S. and foreign government obligations. AIGFP does not seek to manage the market risk of each of its transactions through an individual offsetting transaction. Rather, AIGFP takes a portfolio approach to the management of its market risk exposure. AIGFP values its portfolio at market value or estimated fair value when market values are not readily available. These valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows of AIGFP\\'s transactions and may include reserves for such risks as are deemed appropriate by AIGFP\\'s and AIG\\'s management. AIGFP evaluates the portfolio\\'s discounted cash flows with reference to current market conditions, maturities within the portfolio and other relevant factors. Based upon this evaluation, AIGFP determines what, if any, offsetting transactions are necessary to reduce the market risk exposure of the portfolio. The aforementioned estimated fair values are based upon the use of valuation models. These models utilize, among other things, current interest, foreign exchange and volatility rates.'),\n",

Additionally, AIGFP operates in major business centers overseas and is essentially open for business 24 hours a day. Thus, the market exposure and offset strategies are monitored, reviewed and coordinated around the clock. Therefore, offsetting adjustments can be made as and when necessary from any AIGFP office in the world. As part of its monitoring and controlling of its exposure to market risk, AIGFP applies various testing techniques which reflect potential market movements. These techniques vary by currency and are regularly changed to reflect factors affecting the derivatives portfolio. In addition to the daily monitoring, AIGFP's senior management and local risk managers conduct a weekly review of the derivatives portfolio and existing hedges. This review includes an examination of the portfolio's risk measures, such as aggregate option sensitivity to movements in market variables. AIGFP's management may change these measures to reflect their judgment and evaluation of the dynamics of the markets. This management group will also determine whether additional or alternative action is required in order to manage the portfolio. AIG utilizes an outside consultant to provide the managements of AIG and AIGFP with comfort that the system produces representative values. All of AIGTG's market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for trading purposes. The fair values of AIGTG's financial instruments are exposed to market risk as a result of adverse market changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and adverse changes in the liquidity of the markets in which AIGTG trades. AIGTG's approach to managing market risk is to establish an appropriate offsetting position to a particular transaction or group of transactions depending upon the extent of market risk AIGTG expects to reduce. AIGTG's senior management has established positions and stop-loss limits for each line of business. AIGTG's traders are required to maintain positions within these limits. These positions are monitored during the day either manually and/or through on-line computer systems. In addition, these positions are reviewed by AIGTG's management. Reports which present each trading books position and the prior day's profit and loss are reviewed by traders, head traders and AIGTG's senior management. Based upon these and other reports, AIGTG's senior management may determine to adjust AIGTG's risk profile. AIGTG attempts to secure reliable current market prices, such as published prices or third party quotes, to value its derivatives. Where such prices are not available, AIGTG uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions. The methodology may reflect interest and exchange rates, commodity prices, volatility rates and other relevant factors. A significant portion of AIGTG's business is transacted in liquid markets. Certain of AIGTG's derivative product exposures are evaluated using simulation techniques which consider such factors as changes in currency and commodity prices, interest rates, volatility levels and the effect of time. Though not indicative of the future, past volatile market scenarios have represented profit opportunities for AIGTG. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nAIGFP and AIGTG are both exposed to the risk of loss of fair value from adverse fluctuations in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices. AIG statistically measured the losses of fair value through the application of a VaR model. AIG separately calculated the VaR with respect to AIGFP and AIGTG, as AIG manages these operations separately. AIGFP's and AIGTG's asset and liability portfolios for which the VaR analyses were performed included over the counter and exchange traded investments, derivative instruments and commodities. Since the market risk with respect to securities available for sale, at market is substantially hedged, segregation of market sensitive instruments into trading and other than trading was not deemed necessary. AIG calculated the VaR with respect to AIGFP and AIGTG as of December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997. These calculations used the variance-covariance (delta-normal) methodology. These calculations also used, where appropriate for each entity, daily historical interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity/commodity prices in the two years ending December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997, as applicable. The VaR model estimated the volatility of each of these rates, prices and the correlations among them. For interest rates, the yield curves of the United States and certain foreign countries were constructed using eleven separate points on each country's yield curve to model possible curve movements. Inter-country correlations were also used.\"),\n",

Thus, the VaR measured the sensitivity of the asset and the liability portfolios of each of the market exposures. Each sensitivity was estimated separately to capture the market exposures within each entity. These sensitivities were then applied to a database, which contained both historical ranges of movements in all market factors and the correlations among them. The results depict the maximum potential loss in fair value at a confidence level of 95 percent. Given the distinct business strategies at AIGFP and AIGTG, the VaR calculations used different time periods to measure market exposures. Many of AIGFP's customized, longer-term contracts may require several days to transact and hedge. AIG therefore used a one month holding period to measure market exposures for AIGFP. The large majority of AIGTG's contracts can be arranged and hedged within one day. AIG therefore used a one day holding period to measure market exposures at AIGTG. The following table presents the VaR on a combined basis and of each component of AIGFP's and AIGTG's market risk as of December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997.

DERIVATIVES\\nDerivatives are financial arrangements among two or more parties whose returns are linked to or \"derived\" from some underlying equity, debt, commodity or other asset, liability, or index. Derivatives payments may be based on interest rates and exchange rates and/or prices of certain securities, certain commodities, or financial or commodity indices. The more significant types of derivative arrangements in which AIG transacts are swaps, forwards, futures, options and related instruments. The most commonly used swaps are interest rate and currency swaps. An interest rate swap is a contract between two parties to exchange interest rate payments (typically a fixed interest rate versus a variable interest rate) calculated on a notional principal amount for a specified period of time.

A futures or forward contract is a legal contract between two parties to purchase or sell at a specified future date a specified quantity of a commodity, security, currency, financial index or other instrument, at a specified price. A futures contract is traded on an exchange, while a forward contract is executed over the counter. Over the counter derivatives are not transacted in an exchange traded environment. The futures exchanges maintain considerable financial requirements and surveillance to ensure the integrity of exchange traded futures and options. An option contract generally provides the option purchaser with the right but not the obligation to buy or sell during a period of time or at a specified date the underlying instrument at a set price. The option writer is obligated to sell or buy the underlying item if the option purchaser chooses to exercise his right. The option writer receives a nonrefundable fee or premium paid by the option purchaser. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nDerivatives are generally either negotiated over the counter contracts or standardized contracts executed on an exchange. Standardized exchange traded derivatives include futures and options which can be readily bought or sold over recognized security or commodity exchanges and settled daily through such clearing houses. Negotiated over the counter derivatives include forwards, swaps and options. Over the counter derivatives are generally not traded like exchange traded securities. However, in the normal course of business, with the agreement of the original counterparty, these contracts may be terminated early or assigned to another counterparty. All significant derivatives activities are conducted through AIGFP and AIGTG permitting AIG to participate in the derivatives dealer market acting primarily as principal. In these derivative operations, AIG structures agreements which generally allow its counterparties to enter into transactions with respect to changes in interest and exchange rates, securities' prices and certain commodities and financial or commodity indices. Generally, derivatives are used by AIG's customers such as corporations, financial institutions, multinational organizations, sovereign entities, government agencies and municipalities. For example, a futures, forward or option contract can be used to protect the customers' assets or liabilities against price fluctuations. A counterparty may default on any obligation to AIG, including a derivative contract. Credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and/or carrying trading and investment positions. Credit risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has an estimated positive fair value. To help manage this risk, the credit departments of AIGFP and AIGTG operate within the guidelines of the AIG Credit Risk Committee, which sets credit policy and limits for counterparties and provides limits for derivative transactions with counterparties having different credit ratings. In addition to credit ratings, this committee takes into account other factors, including the industry and country of the counterparty. Transactions which fall outside these pre-established guidelines require the approval of the AIG Credit Risk Committee. It is also AIG's policy to establish reserves for potential credit impairment when necessary. AIGFP and AIGTG determine the credit quality of each of their counterparties taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized statistical rating organizations. If it is determined that a counterparty requires credit enhancement, then one or more enhancement techniques will be used. Examples of such enhancement techniques include letters of credit, guarantees, collateral credit triggers and credit derivatives and margin agreements. A significant majority of AIGFP's transactions are contracted and documented under ISDA Master Agreements that provide for legally enforceable set-off and close out netting of exposures in the event of default. Under such agreements, in connection with the early termination of a transaction, AIGFP is permitted to set-off its receivables from a counterparty against AIGFP's payables to that same counterparty arising out of all included transactions. Excluding regulated exchange transactions, AIGTG, whenever possible, enters into netting agreements with its counterparties which are similar in effect to those discussed above. The following tables provide the notional and contractual amounts of AIGFP's and AIGTG's derivatives transactions at December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997. The notional amounts used to express the extent of AIGFP's and AIGTG's involvement in swap transactions represent a standard of measurement of the volume of AIGFP's and AIGTG's swaps business. Notional amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and it may not necessarily be recorded on the balance sheet. Notional amounts represent those amounts used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received, except for certain contracts such as currency swaps. The timing and the amount of cash flows relating to AIGFP's and AIGTG's foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures and options contracts are determined by each of the respective contractual agreements. The net replacement value most closely represents the net credit risk to AIGFP or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss after the application of the aforementioned strategies, set-off and netting under ISDA Master Agreements and collateral held. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nThe following table presents AIGFP's derivatives portfolio by maturity and type of derivative at December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997:\\nAIGFP determines counterparty credit quality by reference to ratings from independent rating agencies or internal analysis.

At December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997, the counterparty credit quality and counterparty breakdown by industry with respect to the net replacement value of AIGTG\\'s derivatives portfolio was as follows:\\n* Exchange traded futures and options are not deemed to have significant credit exposure as the exchanges guarantee that every contract will be properly settled on a daily basis. Generally, AIG manages and operates its businesses in the currencies of the local operating environment. Thus, exchange gains or losses occur when AIG\\'s foreign currency net investment is affected by changes in the foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar from one reporting period to the next. As an end user, AIG and its subsidiaries, including its insurance subsidiaries, use derivatives to aid in managing AIG\\'s foreign exchange translation exposure. Derivatives may also be used to minimize certain exposures with respect to AIG\\'s debt financing and its insurance operations; to date, such activities have not been significant. AIG has formed a Derivatives Review Committee. This committee, with certain exceptions, provides an independent review of any proposed derivative transaction. The committee examines, among other things, the nature and purpose of the derivative transaction, its potential credit exposure, if any, and the estimated benefits. This committee does not review those derivative transactions entered into by AIGFP and AIGTG for their own account. AIG, through its Foreign Exchange Operating Committee, evaluates each of its worldwide consolidated foreign currency net asset or liability positions and manages AIG\\'s translation exposure to adverse movement in currency exchange rates. AIG may use forward exchange contracts and purchase options where the cost of such is reasonable and markets are liquid to reduce these exchange translation exposures. The exchange gain or loss with respect to these hedging instruments is recorded on an accrual basis as a component of comprehensive income in capital funds. Legal risk arises from the uncertainty of the enforceability, through legal or judicial processes, of the obligations of AIG\\'s clients and counterparties, including contractual provisions intended to reduce credit exposure by providing for the netting of mutual obligations. (See also the discussion on master netting agreements above.) AIG seeks to eliminate or minimize such uncertainty through continuous consultation with internal and external legal advisors, both domestically and abroad, in order to understand the nature of legal risk, to improve documentation and to strengthen transaction structure. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\\nIn June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130 \"Reporting Comprehensive Income\" (FASB 130) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 \"Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information\" (FASB 131). FASB 130 establishes standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements. FASB 130 was effective for AIG as of January 1, 1998. FASB 130 had no impact on AIG\\'s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. FASB 131 establishes standards for the way AIG is required to disclose certain information about its operating segments in its annual financial statements and certain selected information in its interim financial statements. FASB 131 establishes, where practicable, standards with respect to geographic areas, among other things. Certain descriptive information is also required. FASB 131 was effective for the year ended December 31, 1998 and has been adopted herein. In February 1998, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132 \"Employers\\' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits\"(FASB 132). This statement requires AIG to revise its disclosures about pension and other postretirement benefit plans and does not change the measurement or recognition of these plans. Also, FASB 132 requires additional information on changes in the benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets. FASB 132 was effective for the year ended December 31, 1998 and has been adopted herein. In June 1998, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 \"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\" (FASB 133). This statement requires AIG to recognize all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheet measuring these derivatives at fair value. The recognition of the change in the fair value of a derivative depends on a number of factors, including the intended use of the derivative. Currently, AIGTG and AIGFP present, in all material respects, the changes in fair value of their derivative transactions as a component of AIG\\'s operating income.

YEAR 2000 ISSUES\\nAny statements contained herein that are not historical facts, or that might be considered an opinion or projection, whether expressed or implied, are meant as, and should be considered, forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and opinions concerning a variety of known and unknown risks, including those risks related to the Year 2000 issue. If any assumptions or opinions prove incorrect, any forward-looking statements made on that basis may also prove materially incorrect. The Year 2000 issue arises from computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year. This could result in a failure of the information technology systems (IT systems) and other equipment containing imbedded technology (non-IT systems) in the year 2000, causing disruption of operations of AIG, its lessees, vendors, or business partners. AIG has developed a plan to address the Year 2000 issue as it affects AIG's internal IT and non-IT systems, and to assess Year 2000 issues relating to third parties with whom AIG has critical relationships. The plan for addressing internal systems includes an assessment of internal IT and non-IT systems and equipment affected by the Year 2000 issue; definition of strategies to address affected systems and equipment; remediation of identified affected systems and equipment; and internal certification that each internal system is Year 2000 compliant. AIG has remediated, tested and returned to production substantially all of its internal IT systems. AIG continues to remediate and test internal non-IT systems and expects to complete remediation by mid-1999. AIG has also initiated formal communications with respect to the Year 2000 issue to those third parties which have significant interaction with AIG. Currently, AIG is unable to ascertain whether all such third parties will successfully address the Year 2000 issue, particularly those third parties outside the United States where it is believed that remediation efforts relating to the Year 2000 issue may be less advanced. While AIG expects to have no interruption of operations as a result of its internal IT and non-IT systems, significant uncertainties remain about the effect on AIG of third parties who are not Year 2000 compliant. AIG will continue to monitor third party Year 2000 issue readiness to determine whether additional or alternative measures may be necessary. Such measures may include the selection of alternate third parties or other actions designed to mitigate the effects of a third party's lack of preparedness. There can be no assurance that unresolved Year 2000 issues of third parties will not have a material adverse impact on AIG's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. AIG is considering the effects of Year 2000 related failures on its business and, as the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios become more clearly identified, AIG will develop appropriate contingency plans. The costs associated with addressing the Year 2000 issue, including developing and implementing the above stated plans and remediating affected systems and equipment, has approximated $115 million and has been expensed as incurred. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS\\nOn January 1, 1999, certain of the member nations of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) adopted a common currency, the euro. Once the national currencies are phased out, the euro will be the sole legal tender of each of these nations. During the transition period, commerce of these nations will be transacted in the euro or in the currently existing national currency. AIG has identified the significant issues and is prepared with respect to the phase in of and ultimate redenomination to the euro. Any costs associated with the adoption of the euro are expensed as incurred and are not material to AIG's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. The merger of SunAmerica Inc., a leading company in the retirement savings and asset accumulation business, with and into AIG was effective January 1, 1999. The transaction will be treated as a pooling of interests for accounting purposes. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nAIG issued 0.855 shares in exchange for each share of SunAmerica Inc. stock outstanding at the effective time of the merger for an aggregate issuance of approximately 187.5 million shares.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\n(A) PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of American International Group, Inc. and all significant subsidiaries (AIG). Some of AIG's foreign subsidiaries report on a fiscal year ending November 30. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Commencing with the third quarter 1998, Transatlantic and 20th Century were consolidated into AIG's financial statements as AIG became the majority shareholder of these entities. (B) BASIS OF PRESENTATION: The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\"),\n",

The reserve for unearned premiums represents the portion of premiums written relating to the unexpired terms of coverage. Acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums written are earned. Investment income is not anticipated in the deferral of acquisition costs. (See Note 4.)\\nLosses and loss expenses are charged to income as incurred. The reserve for losses and loss expenses represents the accumulation of estimates for reported losses and includes provisions for losses incurred but not reported. The methods of determining such estimates and establishing resulting reserves, including amounts relating to reserves for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance, are continually reviewed and updated. Adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in income currently. AIG discounts certain of its loss reserves which are primarily related to certain workers' compensation claims. (See Note 6.)\\nLife Insurance Operations: AIG's life insurance subsidiaries offer a wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment products. One or more of these subsidiaries is licensed to write life insurance in all states of the United States and in over 70 foreign countries. Traditional products consist of individual and group life, annuity, endowment and accident and health policies. Financial and investment products consist of single premium annuity, variable annuities, guaranteed investment contracts and universal life. Premiums for traditional life insurance products are generally recognized as revenues over the premium paying period of the related policies. Benefits and expenses are provided against such revenues to recognize profits over the estimated life of the policies. Revenues for universal life and investment-type products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, administration, and surrenders during the period. Expenses include interest credited to policy account balances and benefit payments made in excess of policy account balances. Investment income reflects certain minor amounts of realized capital gains where the gains are deemed to be an inherent element in pricing certain life products in some foreign countries. Policy acquisition costs for traditional life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period of the policy. Deferred policy acquisition costs and policy initiation costs related to universal life and investment-type products are amortized in relation to expected gross profits over the life of the policies. (See Note 4.)\\nThe liabilities for future policy benefits and policyholders' contract deposits are established using assumptions described in Note 6. Financial Services Operations: AIG participates in the derivatives dealer market conducting, primarily as principal, an interest rate, currency, equity and credit derivative products business. AIG also enters into structured transactions including long-dated forward foreign exchange contracts, option transactions, liquidity facilities and investment agreements and invests in a diversified portfolio of securities. AIG engages in market making and trading activities, as principal, in foreign exchange, interest rates and precious and base metals. AIG owns inventories in the commodities in which it trades and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the use of swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts. AIG, as lessor, leases flight equipment principally under operating leases. Accordingly, income is reported over the life of the lease as rentals become receivable under the provisions of the lease or, in the case of leases with varying payments, under the straight-line method over the noncancelable term of the lease. In certain cases, leases provide for additional amounts contingent on usage. AIG is also a remarketer of flight equipment for its own account and for airlines and financial institutions. AIG's revenues from such operations consist of net gains on sales of flight equipment and commissions. (C) INVESTMENTS IN FIXED MATURITIES AND EQUITY SECURITIES: Bonds and preferred stocks held to maturity, both of which are principally owned by the insurance subsidiaries, are carried at amortized cost where AIG has the ability and positive intent to hold these securities until maturity. Where AIG may not have the positive intent to hold these securities until maturity, those bonds are considered to be available for sale and carried at current market values. Interest income with respect to fixed maturity securities is accrued currently. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc.\"),\n",

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\\nIncluded in the bonds available for sale are collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). Premiums and discounts arising from the purchase of CMOs are treated as yield adjustments over their estimated life. Bond trading securities are carried at current market values, as it is AIG's intention to sell these securities in the near term. Common and non-redeemable preferred stocks are carried at current market values. Dividend income is generally recognized when receivable. Unrealized gains and losses from investments in equity securities and fixed maturities available for sale are reflected as a separate component of comprehensive income, net of deferred income taxes in capital funds currently. Unrealized gains and losses from investments in trading securities are reflected in income currently. Realized capital gains and losses are determined principally by specific identification. Where declines in values of securities below cost or amortized cost are considered to be other than temporary, a charge is reflected in income for the difference between cost or amortized cost and estimated net realizable value. (D) MORTGAGE LOANS ON REAL ESTATE, POLICY AND COLLATERAL LOANS--NET: Mortgage loans on real estate, policy loans and collateral loans are carried at unpaid principal balances. Interest income on such loans is accrued currently. Impairment of mortgage loans on real estate and collateral loans is generally measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate subject to the fair value of underlying collateral. Interest income on such loans is recognized as cash is received.\"),\n",

Major additions and modifications are capitalized. Normal maintenance and repairs, airframe and engine overhauls and compliance with return conditions of flight equipment on lease are provided by and paid for by the lessee. Under the provisions of most leases for certain airframe and engine overhauls, the lessee is reimbursed for costs incurred up to but not exceeding contingent rentals paid to AIG by the lessee. AIG provides a charge to income for such reimbursements based upon the expected reimbursements during the life of the lease. Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line basis to a residual value of approximately 15 percent over the estimated useful lives of the related assets but not exceeding 25 years. This caption also includes deposits for aircraft to be purchased. At the time the assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the related accounts and the difference, net of proceeds, is recorded as a gain or loss. (F) SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, AT MARKET VALUE: These securities are held to meet long term investment objectives and are accounted for as available for sale, carried at current market values and recorded on a trade date basis. Unrealized gains and losses from valuing these securities and any related hedges are reflected in capital funds currently, net of any related deferred income taxes. When the underlying security is sold, the realized loss or gain resulting from the hedging derivative transaction is recognized in income in that same period as the realized gain or loss of the hedged security. (G) TRADING SECURITIES, AT MARKET VALUE: Trading securities are held to meet short term investment objectives, including hedging securities. These securities are recorded on a trade date basis and carried at current market values. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in income currently. (H) SPOT COMMODITIES, AT MARKET VALUE: Spot commodities are carried at current market values and are recorded on a settlement date basis. The exposure to market risk may be reduced through the use of forwards, futures and option contracts. Unrealized gains and losses of both commodities and any derivative transactions are reflected in income currently. (I) UNREALIZED GAIN AND UNREALIZED LOSS ON INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS, OPTIONS AND FORWARD TRANSACTIONS: Swaps, options and forward transactions are accounted for as contractual commitments recorded on a trade date basis and are carried at current market values or estimated fair values when market values are not available. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in income currently. Estimated fair values are based on the use of valuation models that utilize, among other things, current interest, foreign exchange and volatility rates. These valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows of these transactions and may include reserves for market risk as deemed appropriate. The portfolio's discounted cash flows are evaluated with reference to current market conditions, maturities within the portfolio and other relevant factors. Based upon this evaluation, it is determined what offsetting transactions, if any, are necessary to reduce the market risk of the portfolio. AIG manages its market risk with a variety of transactions, including swaps, trading securities, futures contracts and other transactions as appropriate. Because of the limited liquidity of some of these instruments, the recorded values of these transactions may be different than the values that might be realized if AIG were to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes that such differences are not significant to the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. (J) TRADING ASSETS AND TRADING LIABILITIES: Trading assets and trading liabilities include option premiums paid and received and receivables from and payables to counterparties which relate to unrealized gains and losses on futures, forwards and options and balances due from and due to clearing brokers and exchanges. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\\nFutures, forwards and options purchased and written are accounted for as contractual commitments on a trade date basis and are carried at fair values. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in income currently. The fair values of futures contracts are based on closing exchange quotations. Commodity forward transactions are carried at fair values derived from dealer quotations and underlying commodity exchange quotations. For long dated forward transactions, where there are no dealer or exchange quotations, fair values are derived using internally developed valuation methodologies based on available market information. Options are carried at fair values based on the use of valuation models that utilize, among other things, current interest or commodity rates and foreign exchange and volatility rates, as applicable. (K) SECURITIES PURCHASED (SOLD) UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL (REPURCHASE), AT CONTRACT VALUE: Purchases of securities under agreements to resell and sales of securities under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized transactions and are recorded at their contracted resale or repurchase amounts, plus accrued interest. Generally, it is AIG's policy to take possession of or obtain a security interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell. AIG minimizes the credit risk that counterparties to transactions might be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations by monitoring customer credit exposure and collateral value and generally requiring additional collateral to be deposited with AIG when deemed necessary. (L) OTHER INVESTED ASSETS: Other invested assets consist primarily of investments by AIG's insurance operations in joint ventures and partnerships and other investments not classified elsewhere herein. The joint ventures and partnerships are carried at equity or cost depending on the nature of the invested asset and the ownership percentage thereof. Other investments are carried at cost or market values depending upon the nature of the underlying assets.\"),\n",

(M) REINSURANCE ASSETS: Reinsurance assets include the balances due from both reinsurance and insurance companies under the terms of AIG's reinsurance arrangements for paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses, ceded unearned premiums and ceded future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and benefits paid and unpaid. It also includes funds held under reinsurance treaties. (N) INVESTMENTS IN PARTIALLY-OWNED COMPANIES: The equity method of accounting is used for AIG's investment in companies in which AIG's ownership interest approximates twenty but is not greater than fifty percent (minority-owned companies). Equity in income of minority-owned insurance operations is presented separately in the consolidated statement of income. Equity in net income of other unconsolidated companies is principally included in other income (deductions)-net. At December 31, 1998, AIG's significant investments in partially-owned companies included its 19.9 percent interest in Richmond Insurance Company; and its 24.4 percent interest in IPC Holdings, Ltd. This balance sheet caption also includes investments in less significant partially-owned companies and in certain minor majority-owned subsidiaries. The amount of dividends received from unconsolidated subsidiaries owned less than 50 percent were $24 million, $30 million and $13 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996 respectively. The undistributed earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries owned less than 50 percent was $59 million as of December 31, 1998. In January 1998, AIG purchased the 76.1 percent of the outstanding shares of SELIC Holdings, Ltd. (SELIC) which AIG did not own. Prior to the purchase of these shares, SELIC's operations were accounted for on an equity basis and presented as a component of equity in income of minority-owned insurance operations. Subsequent to the acquisition, SELIC was consolidated as a component of general insurance operations. As a result of purchases of the common stock of Transatlantic, as of August 1998, AIG owns more than 50 percent of the voting securities of Transatlantic. Commencing with the third quarter of 1998, AIG accounted for its investment in Transatlantic on a consolidated basis. (O) REAL ESTATE AND OTHER FIXED ASSETS: The costs of buildings and furniture and equipment are depreciated principally on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (maximum of 40 years for buildings and 10 years for furniture and equipment). Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred; expenditures for betterments are capitalized and depreciated. (P) SEPARATE AND VARIABLE ACCOUNTS: Separate and variable accounts represent funds for which investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to the policyholders. Each account has specific investment objectives, and the assets are carried at market value. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims which arise out of any other business of AIG. (Q) SECURITIES AND SPOT COMMODITIES SOLD BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, AT MARKET VALUE: Securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased represent sales of securities and spot commodities not owned at the time of sale. The obligations arising from such transactions are recorded on a trade date basis and carried at the respective current market values or current commodity prices. (R) PREFERRED SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY IN SUBSIDIARY COMPANY: Preferred shareholders' equity in subsidiary company relates to outstanding market auction preferred stock of International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC), a wholly owned subsidiary of AIG. Dividends on such preferred stock are accounted for as interest expense and included as minority interest in the consolidated statement of income. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, inc.\"),\n",

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\\n(S) TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES: Financial statement accounts expressed in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52 \"Foreign Currency Translation\" (FASB 52). Under FASB 52, functional currency assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars generally using current rates of exchange and the related translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of comprehensive income, net of any related taxes in capital funds. Functional currencies are generally the currencies of the local operating environment. Income statement accounts expressed in functional currencies are translated using average exchange rates. The adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign entities operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in income. Exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are also recorded in income currently. The exchange gain or loss with respect to utilization of foreign exchange hedging instruments is recorded as a component of capital funds. (T) INCOME TAXES: Deferred federal and foreign income taxes are provided for temporary differences for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in AIG\\'s financial statements or tax returns. (U) EARNINGS PER SHARE: Basic earnings per common share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, retroactively adjusted to reflect all stock dividends and stock splits. Diluted earnings per share are based on those shares used in basic earnings per share plus shares that would have been outstanding assuming issuance of common shares for all dilutive potential common shares outstanding, retroactively adjusted to reflect all stock dividends and stock splits. The computation of earnings per share for December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 was as follows:\\n(V) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS: In June 1997, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130 \"Reporting Comprehensive Income\" (FASB 130) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 \"Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information\" (FASB 131). FASB 130 establishes standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements. FASB 130 was effective for AIG as of January 1, 1998. FASB 130 had no impact on AIG\\'s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. FASB 131 establishes standards for the way AIG is required to disclose information about its operating segments in its annual financial statements and selected information in its interim financial statements. FASB 131 establishes, where practicable, standards with respect to geographic areas, among other things. Certain descriptive information is also required. FASB 131 was effective for the year ended December 31, 1998 and has been adopted herein. In February 1998, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132 \"Employers\\' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits\"(FASB 132). This statement requires AIG to revise its disclosures about pension and other postretirement benefit plans and does not change the measurement or recognition of these plans. Also, FASB 132 requires additional information on changes in the benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets. FASB132 was effective for the year ended December 31, 1998 and has been adopted herein. In June 1998, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 \"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\" (FASB 133). This statement requires AIG to recognize all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheet measuring these derivatives at fair value. The recognition of the change in the fair value of a derivative depends on a number of factors, including the intended use of the derivative. Currently, AIG Financial Products Corp. and its subsidiaries (AIGFP) and AIG Trading Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (AIGTG) present, in all material respects, the changes in fair value of their derivative transactions as a component of AIG\\'s operating income. AIG is evaluating the impact of FASB 133 with respect to derivative transactions entered into by other AIG operations. AIG believes that the impact of FASB 133 on its results of operations, financial condition or liquidity will not be significant. FASB 133 is effective for the year commencing January 1, 2000. In December 1997, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AcSEC) issued Statement of Position (SOP) 97-3, \"Accounting by Insurance and Other Enterprises for Insurance-Related Assessments.\" This statement provides guidance for the recording of a liability for insurance-related assessments. The statement requires that a liability be recognized in certain defined circumstances. AIG believes that the impact of this\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\\nstatement on its results of operations, financial condition or liquidity will not be significant. This statement is effective for the year commencing January 1, 1999. In October 1998, AcSEC issued SOP 98-7, \"Deposit Accounting: Accounting for Insurance and Reinsurance Contracts That Do Not Transfer Insurance Risk.\" This statement identifies several methods of deposit accounting and provides guidance on the application of each method. This statement classifies insurance and reinsurance contracts for which the deposit method is appropriate as contracts that (i) transfer only significant timing risk, (ii) transfer only significant underwriting risk, (iii) transfer neither significant timing nor underwriting risk, and (iv) have an indeterminate risk. AIG believes that the impact of this statement on its results of operations, financial condition or liquidity will not be significant. This statement is effective for the year commencing January 1, 2000. Restatement of previously issued financial statements is not permitted.'),\n",

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES (continued)\\n(c) The components of the net deferred tax liability as of December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997 were as follows:\\n4. DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS\\nThe following reflects the policy acquisition costs deferred for amortization against future income and the related amortization charged to income for general and life insurance operations, excluding certain amounts deferred and amortized in the same period:\\n5. REINSURANCE\\nIn the ordinary course of business, AIG\\'s general and life insurance companies cede reinsurance to other insurance companies in order to provide greater diversification of AIG\\'s business and limit the potential for losses arising from large risks. General reinsurance is effected under reinsurance treaties and by negotiation on individual risks. Certain of these reinsurance arrangements consist of excess of loss contracts which protect AIG against losses over stipulated amounts. Amounts recoverable from general reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claims liabilities associated with the reinsurance and presented as a component of reinsurance assets. AIG life companies limit exposure to loss on any single life. For ordinary insurance, AIG retains a maximum of approximately one million dollars of coverage per individual life. There are smaller retentions for other lines of business. Life reinsurance is effected principally under yearly renewable term treaties. Amounts recoverable from life reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the assumptions used for the underlying policy benefits and are presented as a component of reinsurance assets. General insurance premiums written and earned were comprised of the following:\\nFor the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, reinsurance recoveries, which reduced loss and loss expenses incurred, amounted to $5.36 billion, $4.59 billion and $5.07 billion, respectively. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\\n5. REINSURANCE (continued)\\nLife insurance net premium income was comprised of the following:\\nLife insurance recoveries, which reduced death and other benefits, approximated $138 million, $136 million and $113 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996. AIG\\'s reinsurance arrangements do not relieve AIG from its direct obligation to its insureds. Thus, a credit exposure exists with respect to both general and life reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations assumed under the reinsurance agreements. AIG holds substantial collateral as security under related reinsurance agreements in the form of funds, securities and/or letters of credit. A provision has been recorded for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance. AIG has been largely successful in prior recovery efforts. AIG evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers through an internal reinsurance security committee consisting of members of AIG\\'s senior management. No single reinsurer is a material reinsurer to AIG nor is AIG\\'s business substantially dependent upon any reinsurance contract. Life insurance ceded to other insurance companies was as follows:\\nLife insurance assumed represented 0.3 percent of gross life insurance in-force at December 31, 1998 and 1997 and 0.2 percent for 1996, and life insurance premium income assumed represented 0.3 percent, 0.2 percent and 0.1 percent of gross premium income for the periods ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996.

The liability for future life policy benefits has been established based upon the following assumptions:\\n(i) Interest rates (exclusive of immediate/terminal funding annuities), which vary by territory, year of issuance and products, range from 3.0 percent to 12.0 percent within the first 20 years. Interest rates on immediate/terminal funding annuities are at a maximum of 12.2 percent and grade to not greater than 7.5 percent.

(iii) The portions of current and prior net income and of current unrealized appreciation of investments that can inure to the benefit of AIG are restricted in some cases by the insurance contracts and by the local insurance regulations of the countries in which the policies are in force. (iv) Participating life business represented approximately 30 percent of the gross insurance in-force at December 31, 1998 and 46 percent of gross premium income in 1998. The amount of dividends to be paid is determined annually by the Boards of Directors. Anticipated dividends are considered as a planned contractual benefit in computing the value of future policy benefits and are provided ratably over the premium-paying period of the contracts. (d) The liability for policyholders' contract deposits has been established based on the following assumptions:\\n(i) Interest rates credited on deferred annuities, which vary by territory and year of issuance, range from 3.0 percent to 7.1 percent. Credited interest rate guarantees are generally for a period of one year. Withdrawal charges generally range from 3.0 percent to 10.0 percent grading to zero over a period of 5 to 10 years. (ii) Domestically, GICs have market value withdrawal provisions for any funds withdrawn other than benefit responsive payments. Interest rates credited generally range from 4.7 percent to 8.1 percent and maturities range from 1 to 20 years. Overseas, primarily in the United Kingdom, GIC type contracts are credited at rates ranging from 4.6 percent to 6.5 percent with guarantees generally being one year. Contracts in other foreign locations have interest rates, maturities and withdrawal charges based upon local economic and regulatory conditions. (iii) Interest rates on corporate life insurance products are guaranteed at 4.0 percent and the weighted average rate credited in 1998 was 7.0 percent. (iv) The universal life funds have credited interest rates of 4.5 percent to 7.5 percent and guarantees ranging from 3.5 percent to 5.5 percent depending on the year of issue. Additionally, universal life funds are subject to surrender charges that amount to 11.0 percent of the fund balance grading to zero over a period not longer than 20 years. (e) Experience adjustments, relating to future policy benefits and policyholders' contract deposits, vary according to the type of contract and the territory in which the policy is in force. In general terms, investments, mortality and morbidity results may be passed through by experience credits or as an adjustment to the premium mechanism, subject to local regulatory guidance. 7. STATUTORY FINANCIAL DATA\\nStatutory surplus and net income for general insurance and life insurance operations as reported to regulatory authorities were as follows:\\n* Includes net realized capital gains and losses. AIG's insurance subsidiaries file financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by domestic or foreign insurance regulatory authorities. The differences between statutory financial statements and financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP vary between domestic and foreign jurisdictions. The principal differences are that statutory financial statements do not reflect deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred income taxes, all bonds are carried at amortized cost and reinsurance assets and liabilities are presented net of reinsurance. AIG's use of permitted statutory accounting practices does not have a significant impact on statutory surplus. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\\n8.

The notes are also redeemable at the option of AIG or bearer notes may be redeemed at the option of the holder in the event of certain changes involving taxation in the United States at prices ranging from 52.72 percent currently, to 89.88 percent after August 15, 2003, of the principal amount at stated maturity together with accrued amortization of original issue discount from the preceding August 15. During 1998 and 1997, no notes were repurchased. At December 31, 1998, the notes outstanding had a face value of $189 million, an unamortized discount of $87 million and a net book value of $102 million. The amortization of the original issue discount was recorded as interest expense. (ii) Italian Lire Bonds: In December, 1991, AIG issued unsecured bonds denominated in Italian Lire. The principal amount of 200 billion Italian Lire Bonds matures December 4, 2001 and accrues interest at a rate of 11.7 percent which is paid annually. These bonds are not redeemable prior to maturity, except in the event of certain changes involving taxation in the United States or the imposition of certain certification, identification or reporting requirements. Simultaneous with the issuance of this debt, AIG entered into a swap transaction which effectively converted AIG's net interest expense to a U.S. dollar liability of approximately 7.9 percent, which requires the payment of proceeds at maturity of approximately $159 million in exchange for 200 billion Italian Lire and interest thereon.

(F) REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES: AIG and Funding have entered into two syndicated revolving credit facilities (the Facilities) aggregating $1 billion. The Facilities consist of a $500 million 364 day revolving credit facility and a $500 million five year revolving credit facility. The Facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and also provide backup for AIG\\'s commercial paper programs administered by Funding. There are currently no borrowings outstanding under either of the Facilities, nor were any borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 1998. (G) INTEREST EXPENSE FOR ALL INDEBTEDNESS: Total interest expense for all indebtedness, net of capitalized interest, aggregated $1.87 billion in 1998, $1.70 billion in 1997 and $1.49 billion in 1996. Dividends on the preferred stock of ILFC are accounted for as interest expense and included as minority interest in the consolidated statement of income. The dividends for December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 were approximately $17 million in each of the three years. 10. CAPITAL FUNDS\\n(a) At December 31, 1998, there were 6,000,000 shares of AIG\\'s $5 par value serial preferred stock authorized, issuable in series. (b) AIG parent depends on its subsidiaries for cash flow in the form of loans, advances and dividends. AIG\\'s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions on the amount of dividends which can be remitted to AIG parent. These restrictions vary by state. For example, unless permitted by the New York Superintendent of Insurance, general insurance companies domiciled in New York may not pay dividends to shareholders which in any twelve month period exceed the lesser of 10 percent of the company\\'s statutory policyholders\\' surplus or 100 percent of its \"adjusted net investment income\", as defined. Generally, less severe restrictions applicable to both general and life insurance companies exist in most of the other states in which AIG\\'s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled. Certain foreign jurisdictions have restrictions which generally cause only a temporary delay in the remittance of dividends. There are also various local restrictions limiting cash loans and advances to AIG by its subsidiaries. Largely as a result of the restrictions, approximately 65 percent of consolidated capital funds were restricted from immediate transfer to AIG parent at December 31, 1998. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\\n10.

In addition, AIG guarantees various obligations of certain subsidiaries. (a) Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend subject to certain conditions. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses and typically require payment of a fee. These commitments, made principally by AIG Capital Corp., approximated $92 million for both December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997. AIG uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. AIG evaluates each counterparty's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by AIG upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. (b) AIG and certain of its subsidiaries become parties to financial instruments with market risk resulting from both dealer and end user activities and to reduce currency, interest rate, equity and commodity exposures. To the extent those instruments are carried at their estimated fair value, the elements of currency, interest rate, equity and commodity risks are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. In addition, these instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk not explicitly recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. Collateral is required, at the discretion of AIG, on certain transactions based on the creditworthiness of the counterparty. (c) AIGFP becomes a party to off-balance sheet financial instruments in the normal course of its business and to reduce its currency, interest rate and equity exposures. Interest rate, currency and equity risks related to such instruments are reflected in the consolidated financial statements to the extent these instruments are carried at a market or a fair value, whichever is appropriate. Because of limited liquidity of certain of these instruments, the recorded estimated fair values of such instruments may be different than the values that might be realized if AIGFP were to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIGFP, as principal and for its own account, enters into interest rate, currency and equity swaps, swaptions and forward commitments. Interest rate swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. AIGFP typically becomes a principal in the exchange of interest payments between the parties and, therefore, may be exposed to loss, if counterparties default. Currency and equity swaps are similar to interest rate swaps, but may involve the exchange of principal amounts at the beginning and end of the transaction. At December 31, 1998, the notional principal amount of the sum of the swap pays and receives approximated $345.5 billion, primarily related to interest rate swaps of approximately $255.9 billion. The following tables provide the contractual and notional amounts of derivatives transactions of AIGFP and AIGTG at December 31, 1998. The notional amounts used to express the extent of involvement in swap transactions represent a standard of measurement of the volume of swaps business of AIGFP and AIGTG. Notional amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and it may not necessarily be recorded on the balance sheet. Notional amounts represent those amounts used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received, except for certain contracts such as currency swaps. The timing and the amount of cash flows relating to AIGFP's and AIGTG's foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures and options contracts are determined by each of the respective contractual agreements. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\n11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (continued)\\nThe following table presents AIGFP's derivatives portfolio by maturity and type of derivative at December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997:\\nFutures and forward contracts are contracts for delivery of foreign currencies or financial indices in which the seller/purchaser agrees to make/take delivery at a specified future date of a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield. Risks arise as a result of movements in current market prices from contracted prices and the potential inability of counterparties to meet their obligations under the contracts. At December 31, 1998, the contractual amount of AIGFP's futures and forward contracts approximated $51.2 billion. The following table presents AIGFP's futures and forward contracts portfolio by maturity and type of derivative at December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997:\\nThese instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk not explicitly recognized in the consolidated financial statements. AIGFP utilizes various credit enhancements, including collateral, credit triggers and credit derivatives to reduce the credit exposure relating to these off-balance sheet financial instruments. AIGFP requires credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties and the transaction's size and maturity. In addition, AIGFP's derivative transactions are generally documented under ISDA Master Agreements. Such agreements provide for legally enforceable set-off and close out netting of exposures to specific counterparties. Under such agreements, in connection with an early termination of a transaction, AIGFP is permitted to set off its receivables from a counterparty against its payables to the same counterparty arising out of all included transactions. As a result, the net replacement value represents the net sum of estimated positive fair values after the application of such strategies, agreements and collateral held. The net replacement value most closely represents the net credit risk to AIGFP or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss. The net replacement value of all interest rate, currency, and equity swaps, swaptions and forward commitments at December 31, 1998, approximated $8.76 billion. The net replacement value for futures and forward contracts at December 31, 1998, approximated $469 million. AIGFP independently evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties, taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized statistical rating organizations. In addition, AIGFP's credit approval process involves pre-set counterparty, country and industry credit exposure limits and, for particularly credit intensive transactions, obtaining approval from AIG's Credit Risk Committee. The average credit rating of AIGFP's counterparties as a whole (as measured by AIGFP) is equivalent to AA. The maximum potential loss will increase or decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\\n11.

The agreements allow the holders, in certain circumstances, to tender the notes to the issuer at par value. In the event a remarketing agent of an issuer is unable to resell such tendered notes, AIGFP would be obligated to purchase the notes at par value. With respect to certain notes that have been issued, AIGFP has fulfilled its liquidity commitments by arranging bank liquidity facilities. These banks agree to purchase the notes that AIGFP is otherwise obligated to purchase in connection with a failed remarketing. It is the intention of AIGFP to arrange similar liquidity with respect to the $123 million aggregate amount of notes that are expected to be issued through 1999. Securities sold, but not yet purchased represent obligations of AIGFP to deliver specified securities at their contracted prices, and thereby create a liability to repurchase the securities in the market at prevailing prices. AIGFP monitors and controls its risk exposure on a daily basis through financial, credit and legal reporting systems and, accordingly, believes that it has in place effective procedures for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which it is subject. Management is not aware of any potential counterparty defaults. The net trading revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 from AIGFP's operations were $550 million, $452 million and $369 million, respectively.

Risks arise as a result of movements in current market prices from contracted prices, and the potential inability of the counterparties to meet their obligations under the contracts. As a writer of options, AIGTG generally receives an option premium and then manages the risk of any unfavorable change in the value of the underlying commodity, currency or index.

At December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997, the counterparty credit quality and counterparty breakdown by industry with respect to the net replacement value of AIGTG's derivatives portfolio was as follows:\\n* Exchange traded futures and options are not deemed to have significant credit exposure as the exchanges guarantee that every contract will be properly settled on a daily basis. Spot commodities sold but not yet purchased represent obligations of AIGTG to deliver spot commodities at their contracted prices and thereby create a liability to repurchase the spot commodities in the market at prevailing prices. AIGTG limits its risks by holding offsetting positions. In addition, AIGTG monitors and controls its risk exposures through various monitoring systems which evaluate AIGTG's market and credit risks, and through credit approvals and limits. At December 31, 1998, AIGTG did not have a significant concentration of credit risk from either an individual counterparty or group of counterparties. The net trading revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 from AIGTG's operations were $374 million, $562 million and $289 million, respectively. At December 31, 1998, AIGTG had issued and outstanding $140 million principal amount of letters of credit. These letters of credit were issued primarily to various exchanges. AIG has issued unconditional guarantees with respect to the prompt payment, when due, of all present and future obligations and liabilities of AIGFP and AIGTG arising from transactions entered into by AIGFP and AIGTG. (e) At December 31, 1998, ILFC had committed to purchase or had secured positions for 303 aircraft deliverable from 1999 through 2006 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $17.4 billion. ILFC will be required to find customers for any aircraft presently on order and any aircraft to be ordered, and it must arrange financing for portions of the purchase price of such equipment. (f) AIG and its subsidiaries, in common with the insurance industry in general, are subject to litigation, including claims for punitive damages, in the normal course of their business. AIG does not believe that such litigation will have a material effect on its operating results and financial condition. AIG continues to receive claims asserting injuries from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites (hereinafter collectively referred to as environmental claims) and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a difficult process, as these claims, which emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years, cannot be estimated by conventional reserving techniques. Asbestos and environmental claims development is affected by factors such as inconsistent court resolutions, the broadening of the intent of policies and scope of coverage and increasing number of new claims. AIG and other industry members have and will continue to litigate the broadening judicial interpretation of policy coverage and the liability issues. If the courts continue in the future to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage, as they have in the past, additional liabilities would emerge for amounts in excess of reserves held. This emergence cannot now be reasonably estimated, but could have a material impact on AIG's future operating results. The reserves carried for these claims as at December 31, 1998 ($2.5 billion gross; $865 million net) are believed to be adequate as these reserves are based on known facts and current law. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc.\"),\n",

These financial instruments may or may not be recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. In the measurement of the fair value of certain of the financial instruments, quoted market prices were not available and other valuation techniques were utilized. These derived fair value estimates are significantly affected by the assumptions used. FASB 107 excludes certain financial instruments, including those related to insurance contracts. The following methods and assumptions were used by AIG in estimating the fair value of the financial instruments presented:\\nCash and short-term investments: The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for these instruments approximate fair values. Fixed maturity securities: Fair values for fixed maturity securities carried at amortized cost or at market value were generally based upon quoted market prices. For certain fixed maturity securities for which market prices were not readily available, fair values were estimated using values obtained from independent pricing services. No other fair valuation techniques were applied to these securities as AIG believes it would have to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived. Equity securities: Fair values for equity securities were based upon quoted market prices. Mortgage loans on real estate, policy and collateral loans: Where practical, the fair values of loans on real estate and collateral loans were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based upon AIG\\'s current incremental lending rates for similar type loans. The fair values of the policy loans were not calculated as AIG believes it would have to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived. Trading assets and trading liabilities: Fair values for trading assets and trading liabilities approximate the carrying values presented in the consolidated balance sheet. Securities available for sale: Fair values for securities available for sale and related hedges were based on quoted market prices. For securities and related hedges for which market prices were not readily available, fair values were estimated using quoted market prices of comparable investments. Trading securities: Fair values for trading securities were based on current market value where available. For securities for which market values were not readily available, fair values were estimated using quoted market prices of comparable investments. Spot commodities: Fair values for spot commodities were based on current market prices. Unrealized gains and losses on interest rate and currency swaps, options and forward transactions: Fair values for swaps, options and forward transactions were based on the use of valuation models that utilize, among other things, current interest, foreign exchange and volatility rates, as applicable. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\\n12. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)\\nSecurities purchased (sold) under agreements to resell (repurchase), at contract value: As these securities (obligations) are short-term in nature, the contract values approximate fair values. Other invested assets: For assets for which market prices were not readily available, fair valuation techniques were not applied as AIG believes it would have to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived. Policyholders\\' contract deposits: Fair values of policyholder contract deposits were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based upon interest rates currently being offered for similar contracts with maturities consistent with those remaining for the contracts being valued. GIAs: Fair values of AIG\\'s obligations under investment type agreements were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based on interest rates currently being offered for similar agreements with maturities consistent with those remaining for the agreements being valued. Additionally, AIG follows a policy of minimizing interest rate risks associated with GIAs by entering into swap transactions. Securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased: The carrying amounts for the financial instruments approximate fair values. Fair values for spot commodities sold short were based on current market prices. Deposits due to banks and other depositors: To the extent certain amounts are not demand deposits or certificates of deposit which mature in more than one year, fair values were not calculated as AIG believes it would have to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived. Commercial paper: The carrying amount of AIG\\'s commercial paper borrowings approximates fair value. Notes, bonds, loans and mortgages payable: Where practical, the fair values of these obligations were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based upon AIG\\'s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowings with maturities consistent with those remaining for the debt being valued. The carrying values and fair values of AIG\\'s financial instruments at December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997 and the average fair values with respect to derivative positions during 1998 and 1997 were as follows:\\nOff-balance sheet financial instruments: Financial instruments which are not currently recognized in the consolidated balance sheet of AIG are principally commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees. The unrecognized fair values of these instruments represent fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the current agreements and the counterparties\\' credit standings.

STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS\\nAt December 31, 1998, AIG had two types of stock-based compensation plans. One was a stock option plan; the other, an employee stock purchase plan. AIG applies APB Opinion 25 \"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees\" and related Interpretations in accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no compensation costs have been recognized for either plan. Had compensation costs for these plans been determined consistent with the method of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 \"Accounting for Awards of Stock Based Compensation to Employees,\" AIG\\'s net income and earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts as follows:\\n(A) STOCK OPTION PLAN: On December 19, 1991, the AIG Board of Directors adopted a 1991 employee stock option plan (the 1991 Plan), which provided that options to purchase a maximum of 10,125,000 shares of common stock could be granted to officers and other key employees at prices not less than fair market value at the date of grant. Both the 1991 Plan, and the options with respect to 252,870 shares granted thereunder on December 19, 1991, were approved by shareholders at the 1992 Annual Meeting. An amendment to the 1991 Plan, approved by shareholders at the 1997 Annual Meeting, increased the aggregate number of shares available for grant to 17,718,750 shares to assure that adequate shares are available for grant during the remaining term of the 1991 Plan. A second amendment to the 1991 Plan limits the maximum number of shares as to which stock options may be granted to any employee in any one year to 202,500 shares. At December 31, 1998, 9,184,869 shares were reserved for future grants under the amended 1991 Plan. As of March 18, 1992, no further options could be granted under the 1987 employee stock option plan (the 1987 Plan), but outstanding options granted under the 1987 Plan continue in force until exercise or expiration. At December 31, 1998, there were 8,882,557 shares reserved for issuance under these plans. Under each plan, 25 percent of the options granted become exercisable on the anniversary of the date of grant in each of the four years following that grant and all options expire 10 years from the date of the grant. As of December 31, 1998, outstanding options granted with respect to 5,762,938 shares qualified for Incentive Stock Option treatment under the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. Additional information with respect to AIG\\'s plans at December 31, 1998, and changes for the three years then ended, was as follows:\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\\n13. STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS (continued)\\nInformation about stock options outstanding at December 31, 1998, is summarized as follows:\\nThe fair values of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 were $28 million, $29 million and $26 million, respectively. The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions were used for grants in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively: dividend yields of 0.24 percent, 0.30 percent and 0.33 percent; expected volatilities of 22.0 percent, 20.0 percent and 20.0 percent; risk-free interest rates of 4.73 percent, 6.03 percent and 6.29 percent and expected terms of 7 years. (B) EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN: AIG\\'s 1984 employee stock purchase plan was adopted at its 1984 shareholders\\' meeting and became effective as of July 1, 1984. Eligible employees could receive privileges to purchase up to an aggregate of 4,429,687 shares of AIG common stock, at a price equal to 85 percent of the fair market value on the date of grant of the purchase privilege. Purchase privileges were granted annually and were limited to the number of whole shares that could be purchased by an amount equal to 5 percent of an employee\\'s annual salary or $5,500, whichever was less. AIG\\'s 1996 employee stock purchase plan was adopted at its 1996 shareholders\\' meeting and became effective as of July 1, 1996, replacing the 1984 plan. Eligible employees may receive privileges to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,250,000 shares of AIG common stock, at a price equal to 85 percent of the fair market value on the date of the grant of the purchase privilege. Purchase privileges are granted annually and are limited to the number of whole shares that can be purchased by an amount equal to 5 percent of an employee\\'s annual salary or $5,500, whichever is less. Beginning with the January 1, 1998 subscription, the maximum allowable purchase limitation increased to 10 percent of an employee\\'s annual salary or $10,000 per year, whichever is less, and the eligibility requirement was reduced from two years to one year. In all other respects, the 1996 plan is identical to the 1984 plan. There were 104,008 shares and 328,988 shares issued under the 1984 plan at weighted average prices of $35.17 and $29.73 for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. There were 340,419 shares and 220,627 shares issued under the 1996 plan at weighted average prices of $53.89 and $38.51 for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The excess or deficit of the proceeds over the par value or cost of the common stock issued under these plans was credited or charged to additional paid-in capital. As of December 31, 1998, there were 396,285 shares of common stock subscribed to at a weighted average price of $71.63 per share pursuant to grants of privileges under the 1996 plan. There were 1,292,668 shares available for the grant of future purchase privileges under the 1996 plan at December 31, 1998. The fair values of purchase privileges granted during the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 were $10 million, $4 million and $3 million, respectively. The weighted average fair values per share of those purchase rights granted in 1998, 1997 and 1996 were $19.33, $13.35 and $8.76, respectively. The fair value of each purchase right is estimated on the date of the subscription using the Black-Scholes model. The following weighted average assumptions were used for grants in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively: dividend yields of 0.24 percent, 0.30 percent and 0.37 percent; expected volatilities of 33.0 percent, 26.0 percent and 21.9 percent; risk-free interest rates of 5.26 percent, 5.81 percent and 5.54 percent; and expected terms of 1 year. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc.'),\n",

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\\n(a) Employees of AIG, its subsidiaries and certain affiliated companies, including employees in foreign countries, are generally covered under various funded and insured pension plans. Eligibility for participation in the various plans is based on either completion of a specified period of continuous service or date of hire, subject to age limitation. AIG\\'s U.S. retirement plan is a qualified, noncontributory, defined benefit plan. All qualified employees, including those of Transatlantic, who have attained age 21 and completed twelve months of continuous service are eligible to participate in this plan. An employee with 5 or more years of service is entitled to pension benefits beginning at normal retirement at age 65. Benefits are based upon a percentage of average final compensation multiplied by years of credited service limited to 44 years of credited service. The average final compensation is subject to certain limitations. Annual funding requirements are determined based on the \"projected unit credit\" cost method which attributes a pro rata portion of the total projected benefit payable at normal retirement to each year of credited service. AIG has adopted a Supplemental Executive Retirement Program (Supplemental Plan) to provide additional retirement benefits to designated executives and key employees. Under the Supplemental Plan, the annual benefit, not to exceed 60 percent of average final compensation, accrues at a percentage of average final pay multiplied for each year of credited service reduced by any benefits from the current and any predecessor retirement plans, Social Security, if any, and from any qualified pension plan of prior employers. The Supplemental Plan also provides a benefit equal to the reduction in benefits payable under the AIG retirement plan as a result of Federal limitations on benefits payable thereunder. Currently, the Supplemental Plan is unfunded. Eligibility for participation in the various non-U.S. retirement plans is either based on completion of a specified period of continuous service or date of hire, subject to age limitation. Where non-U.S. retirement plans are defined benefit plans, they are generally based on the employees\\' years of credited service and average compensation in the years preceding retirement. In addition to AIG\\'s defined benefit pension plan, AIG and its subsidiaries provide a postretirement benefit program for medical care and life insurance, domestically and in certain foreign countries. Eligibility in the various plans is generally based upon completion of a specified period of eligible service and reaching a specified age. Benefits vary by geographic location. AIG\\'s U.S. postretirement medical and life insurance benefits are based upon the employee electing immediate retirement and having a minimum of ten years of service. Retirees and their dependents who were age 65 by May 1, 1989 participate in the medical plan at no cost. Employees who retired after May 1, 1989 and on or prior to January 1, 1993 pay the active employee premium if under age 65 and 50 percent of the active employee premium if over age 65. Retiree contributions are subject to adjustment annually. Other cost sharing features of the medical plan include deductibles, coinsurance and Medicare coordination and a lifetime maximum benefit of $1 million. The lifetime maximum benefit of the medical plan was increased to $1.5 million effective January 1, 1999. The maximum life insurance benefit prior to age 70 is $32,500, with a maximum of $25,000 thereafter. Effective January 1, 1993, both plans\\' provisions were amended. Employees who retire after January 1, 1993 are required to pay the actual cost of the medical benefits premium reduced by a credit which is based upon age and years of service at retirement. The life insurance benefit varies by age at retirement from $5,000 for retirement at ages 55 through 59 to $15,000 for retirement at ages 65 and over. These plans also benefit Transatlantic\\'s employees. (b) AIG sponsors a voluntary savings plan for domestic employees, including those of Transatlantic, (a 401(k) plan), which, during the three years ended December 31, 1998, provided for salary reduction contributions by employees and matching contributions by AIG of up to 6 percent of annual salary depending on the employees\\' years of service. (c) AIG has certain benefits provided to former or inactive employees who are not retirees. Certain of these benefits are insured and expensed currently; other expenses are provided for currently. Such uninsured expenses include long and short-term disability medical and life insurance continuation, short-term disability income continuation and COBRA medical subsidies. The provision for these benefits at December 31, 1998 was $5 million.'),\n",

These segments and their respective operations are as follows:\\nGeneral Insurance - AIG's general insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance. One or more of these companies is licensed to write substantially all of these lines in all states of the United States and in approximately 100 foreign countries. DBG writes substantially all classes of business insurance accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers. This provides DBG the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to submit business to DBG without the traditional agent-company contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no authority to commit DBG to accept a risk. Transatlantic's domestic operations are included in this group. AIG's Foreign General insurance group accepts risks primarily underwritten through AIU, a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned agencies and insurance entities. The Foreign General insurance group also includes business written by AIG's foreign-based insurance subsidiaries for their own accounts. The Foreign General group uses various marketing methods to write both business and personal lines insurance with certain refinements for local laws, customs and needs. AIU operates in over 70 countries in Asia, the Pacific Rim, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America. Transatlantic's foreign operations are included in this group. Life Insurance - AIG's life insurance subsidiaries offer a wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment products. One or more of these subsidiaries is licensed to write life insurance in all states in the United States and in over 70 foreign countries. Traditional products consist of individual and group life, annuity, endowment and accident and health policies. Financial and investment products consist of single premium annuity, variable annuities, guaranteed investment contracts, universal life and pensions. AIG's three principal overseas life operations are ALICO, AIA and Nan Shan. ALICO is incorporated in Delaware and all of its business is written outside of the United States. ALICO has operations either directly or through subsidiaries in approximately 50 countries located in Europe, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and the Far East, with Japan being the largest territory. AIA operates primarily in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. Nan Shan operates in Taiwan. Financial Services - AIG's financial services subsidiaries engage in diversified financial products and services including asset management, premium financing, banking services and consumer finance services. ILFC engages primarily in the acquisition of new and used commercial jet aircraft and the leasing and remarketing of such aircraft to airlines around the world. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n17.

Commencing in 1997, agency operations were presented as a component of general insurance and for years prior to 1997 agency results have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. The following table shows identifiable assets, revenues and income derived from operations in the United States and Canada and from operations in other countries for the year ended December 31, 1999. (See also Note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nGeneral Insurance Operations\\nAIG\\'s general insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance. One or more of these companies is licensed to write substantially all of these lines in all states of the United States and in approximately 70 foreign countries. Domestic general insurance operations are comprised of the Domestic Brokerage Group, which includes the domestic operations of Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (\"Transatlantic\"), Personal Lines, including 21st Century Insurance Group (21st Century), and Mortgage Guaranty. Commencing with the third quarter of 1998, Transatlantic and 21st Century were consolidated into AIG\\'s financial statements, as a result of AIG obtaining majority ownership. AIG\\'s primary domestic division is the Domestic Brokerage Group (DBG). DBG\\'s business is derived from brokers in the United States and Canada and is conducted through its general insurance subsidiaries including American Home, National Union, Lexington, Transatlantic and certain other insurance company subsidiaries of AIG. The risk management division of DBG provides insurance and risk management programs for large corporate customers. The AIG Risk Finance division designs and implements creative risk financing alternatives using the insurance and financial services capabilities of AIG. Also included are the operations of DBG\\'s environmental unit which focuses specifically on providing specialty products to clients with environmental exposures. DBG writes substantially all classes of business insurance accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers. This provides DBG the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to submit business to DBG without the traditional agent-company contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no authority to commit DBG to accept a risk. In addition to writing substantially all classes of business insurance, including large commercial or industrial property insurance, excess liability, inland marine, environmental, workers\\' compensation and excess and umbrella coverages, DBG offers many specialized forms of insurance such as directors and officers liability, difference-in-conditions, kidnap-ransom, export credit and political risk, and various types of professional errors and omissions coverages. Lexington writes surplus lines, those risks for which conventional insurance companies do not readily provide insurance coverage, either because of complexity or because the coverage does not lend itself to conventional contracts. AIG engages in mass marketing of personal lines coverages, primarily private passenger auto and includes homeowners and personal umbrella coverages, principally through American International Insurance Company and 21st Century. The business of United Guaranty Corporation (\"UGC\") and its subsidiaries is also included in the domestic operations of AIG. The principal business of the UGC subsidiaries is the writing of residential mortgage loan insurance, which is guaranty insurance on conventional first mortgage loans on single-family dwellings and condominiums. Such insurance protects lenders against loss if borrowers default. UGC subsidiaries also write home equity and property improvement loan insurance on loans to finance residential property improvements, alterations and repairs and for other purposes not necessarily related to real estate. UGC had approximately $19 billion of mortgage guarantee risk in-force at December 31, 1999. AIG\\'s Foreign General insurance group accepts risks primarily underwritten through American International Underwriters (\"AIU\"), a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned agencies and insurance companies. The Foreign General insurance group also includes business written by AIG\\'s foreign-based insurance subsidiaries for their own accounts. The Foreign General group uses various marketing methods to write both business and personal lines insurance with certain refinements for local laws, customs and needs. AIU operates in over 70 countries in Asia, the Pacific Rim, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America. Transatlantic\\'s foreign operations are included in this group. During 1999, DBG and the Foreign General insurance group accounted for 50.0 percent and 34.2 percent, respectively, of AIG\\'s net premiums written. AIG\\'s general insurance company subsidiaries worldwide operate primarily by underwriting and accepting any size risk for their direct account and securing reinsurance on that portion of the risk in excess of the limit which they wish to retain. This operating policy differs from that of many insurance companies which will underwrite only up to their net retention limit, thereby requiring the broker or agent to secure commitments from other underwriters for the remainder of the gross risk amount. The following table summarizes general insurance premiums written and earned:\\nThe utilization of reinsurance is closely monitored by an internal reinsurance security committee, consisting of members of AIG\\'s senior management. No single reinsurer is a material reinsurer to AIG nor is AIG\\'s business substantially dependent upon any reinsurance contract. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG is well diversified both in terms of lines of business and geographic locations. Of the general insurance lines of business, workers\\' compensation was approximately 7 percent of AIG\\'s net premiums written. This line is well diversified geographically. The majority of AIG\\'s insurance business is in the casualty classes, which tend to involve longer periods of time for the reporting and settling of claims. This may increase the risk and uncertainty with respect to AIG\\'s loss reserve development. (See also the Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development and Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nLoss and expense ratios of AIG\\'s consolidated general insurance operations are set forth in the following table. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\n* Source: Best\\'s Aggregates & Averages (Stock insurance companies, after dividends to policyholders); the ratio for 1999 reflects estimated results provided by Conning & Company. During 1999, of the direct general insurance premiums written (gross premiums less return premiums and cancellations, excluding reinsurance assumed and before deducting reinsurance ceded), 10.8 percent, 5.8 percent and 5.1 percent were written in California, New York and Illinois, respectively. No other state accounted for more than 5 percent of such premiums. There was no significant adverse effect on AIG\\'s general insurance results of operations from the economic environments in any one state, country or geographic region for the year ended December 31, 1999. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nDiscussion and Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development\\nThe reserve for net losses and loss expenses represents the accumulation of estimates for reported losses (\"case basis reserves\") and provisions for losses incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\"), both reduced by applicable reinsurance recoverable. Losses and loss expenses are charged to income as incurred. AIG discounts certain of its loss reserves principally related to workers\\' compensation lines of business. Loss reserves established with respect to foreign business are set and monitored in terms of the respective local or functional currency. Therefore, no assumption is included for changes in currency rates. (See also Note 1(t) of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nManagement continually reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves through the utilization of a number of analytical reserve development techniques. Through the use of these techniques, management is able to monitor the adequacy of its established reserves and determine appropriate assumptions for inflation. Also, analysis of emerging specific development patterns, such as case reserve redundancies or deficiencies and IBNR emergence, allows management to currently determine any required adjustments. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nThe \"Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development\", which follows, presents the development of net losses and loss expense reserves for calendar years 1989 through 1999. The upper half of the table shows the cumulative amounts paid during successive years related to the opening loss reserves. For example, with respect to the net losses and loss expense reserve of $16.76 billion as of December 31, 1992, by the end of 1999 (seven years later) $14.50 billion had actually been paid in settlement of these net loss reserves. In addition, as reflected in the lower section of the table, the original reserve of $16.76 billion was reestimated to be $18.15 billion at December 31, 1999. This increase from the original estimate would generally be a combination of a number of factors, including reserves being settled for larger amounts than originally estimated.'),\n",

The redundancy (deficiency) depicted in the table, for any particular calendar year, shows the aggregate change in estimates over the period of years subsequent to the calendar year reflected at the top of the respective column heading. For example, the redundancy of $382 million at December 31, 1999 related to December 31, 1998 net losses and loss expense reserves of $24.62 billion represents the cumulative amount by which reserves for 1998 and prior years have developed redundantly during 1999. The reserve for net losses and loss expenses with respect to Transatlantic and 21st Century are included only in the consolidated net losses and loss expenses commencing with the year ended December 31, 1998. Reserve development for these operations is included only for 1998 and subsequent periods. Over the past several years, AIG has significantly strengthened its net loss and loss expense reserves with respect to asbestos and environmental losses. This strengthening is the primary cause of the adverse development reflected in certain calendar years in the net loss and loss expense reserves shown in the following table. Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development\\nThe following table excludes for each calendar year the net loss and loss expense reserves and the development thereof with respect to asbestos and environmental claims. Thus, AIG\\'s loss and loss expense reserves excluding asbestos and environmental claims are developing adequately. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nAnalysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development Excluding Asbestos and Environmental Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development\\nReconciliation of Net Reserve for Losses and Loss Expenses\\n(a) Acquisitions include the opening balances with respect to Transatlantic and 21st Century. (b) Does not include the effects of foreign exchange adjustments which are reflected in the \"Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development\" table. (c) See also Note 6(a) of Notes to Financial Statements. Approximately 45 percent of the net losses and loss expense reserves are paid out within two years of the date incurred. The remaining net losses and loss expense reserves, particularly those associated with the casualty lines of business, may extend to 20 years or more. For further discussion regarding net reserves for losses and loss expenses, see Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The reserve for losses and loss expenses as reported in AIG\\'s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 1999, differs from the total reserve reported in the Annual Statements filed with state insurance departments and, where appropriate, with foreign regulatory authorities. The differences at December 31, 1999 relate primarily to reserves for certain foreign operations. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nThe reserve for gross losses and loss expenses is prior to reinsurance and represents the accumulation for reported losses and IBNR. Management reviews the adequacy of established gross loss reserves in the manner previously described for net loss reserves. The \"Analysis of Consolidated Gross Losses and Loss\\nExpense Reserve Development\", which follows, presents the development of gross losses and loss expense reserves for calendar years 1992 through 1999. As with the net losses and loss expense reserve development, the deficiencies of $1.77 billion and $923 million for 1992 and 1993, and redundancies of $1.02 billion, $1.44 billion, $2.02 billion, $1.15 billion and $1.15 billion for 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively, are relatively insignificant both in terms of an aggregate amount and as a percentage of the initial reserve balance. Analysis of Consolidated Gross Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development\\nLife Insurance Operations\\nAIG\\'s life insurance subsidiaries offer a wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment products. One or more of these subsidiaries is licensed to write life insurance in all states in the United States and in over 70 foreign countries. Traditional products consist of individual and group life, annuity, endowment and accident and health policies. Financial and investment products consist of single premium annuity, variable annuities, guaranteed investment contracts, universal life and pensions. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nLife insurance operations in foreign countries comprised 92.1 percent of life premium income and 66.0 percent of operating income in 1999. AIG operates overseas principally through American Life Insurance Company (ALICO), American International Assurance Company, Limited together with American International Assurance Company (Bermuda) Limited (AIA) and Nan Shan Life Insurance Company, Ltd. (Nan Shan). ALICO is incorporated in Delaware and all of its business is written outside of the United States. ALICO has operations either directly or through subsidiaries in approximately 50 countries located in Europe, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and the Far East, with Japan being the largest territory. AIA operates primarily in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. Nan Shan operates in Taiwan. These operations comprised 89.8 percent of AIG\\'s consolidated life premium income. (See also Note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG\\'s domestic life operations are comprised of two separate operations, AIG\\'s domestic life companies and the life insurance subsidiaries of SunAmerica. AIG\\'s predominant domestic life subsidiaries are American International Life Assurance Company of New York and AIG Life Insurance Company. These companies utilize multiple distribution channels including brokerage and career and general agents to offer primarily life insurance, financial and investment products and specialty forms of accident and health coverage for individuals and groups, including employee benefit plans. SunAmerica sells primarily financial and investment type products. The domestic life operations comprised 7.9 percent of total life premium income in 1999. There was no significant adverse effect on AIG\\'s life insurance results of operations from economic environments in any one state, country or geographic region for the year ended December 31, 1999. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nTraditional life insurance products such as whole life and endowment continue to be significant in the overseas companies, especially in Southeast Asia, while a mixture of traditional, accident and health and financial products are sold in Japan. In addition to the above, AIG also has subsidiary operations in the Philippines, Canada, Mexico, Poland, Switzerland, Puerto Rico, and conducts life insurance business through AIUO subsidiary companies in Russia, Israel and in certain countries in Central and South America. The foreign life companies have approximately 125,000 career agents and sell their products largely to indigenous persons in local currencies. In addition to the agency outlets, these companies also distribute their products through direct marketing channels, such as mass marketing, and through brokers and other distribution outlets such as financial institutions. The following tables summarize the life insurance operating results for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\n(a) Including income related to investment type products. (b) Including $304.7 billion of whole life insurance and endowments. (c) Not applicable. (a) Including income related to investment type products. (b) Including $280.1 billion of whole life insurance and endowments. (c) Not applicable. AIG\\'s individual life insurance and group life insurance portfolio accounted for 52 percent, 53 percent and 52 percent of AIG\\'s consolidated life insurance operating income before realized capital losses for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, 64.7 percent, 68.0 percent and 69.3 percent, respectively, of consolidated life operating income before realized capital losses was derived from foreign operations. Insurance Investment Operations\\nA significant portion of AIG\\'s general and life operating revenues are derived from AIG\\'s insurance investment operations.

AIG's worldwide insurance investment policy places primary emphasis on investments in high quality, fixed income securities in all of its portfolios and, to a lesser extent, investments in marketable common stocks in order to preserve policyholders' surplus and generate net investment income. The ability to implement this policy is somewhat limited in certain territories as there may be a lack of qualified long term investments or investment restrictions may be imposed by the local regulatory authorities.

Additional Investments\\nAIG holds a 24.4 percent interest in IPC Holdings, Ltd., a reinsurance holding company and a 19.9 percent interest in Richmond Insurance Company, Ltd., a reinsurer. (See also Note 1(o) of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nLocations of Certain Assets\\nAs of December 31, 1999, approximately 32 percent of the consolidated assets of AIG were located in foreign countries (other than Canada), including $894 million of cash and securities on deposit with foreign regulatory authorities. Foreign operations and assets held abroad may be adversely affected by political developments in foreign countries, including such possibilities as tax changes, nationalization and changes in\\nregulatory policy, as well as by consequence of hostilities and unrest. The risks of such occurrences and their overall effect upon AIG vary from country to country and cannot easily be predicted. If expropriation or nationalization does occur, AIG's policy is to take all appropriate measures to seek recovery of such assets. Certain of the countries in which AIG's business is conducted have currency restrictions which generally cause a delay in a company's ability to repatriate assets and profits. (See also Notes 1, 2 and 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nInsurance Regulation and Competition\\nCertain states require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies which are licensed in such states and are controlled by other corporations. Applicable legislation typically requires periodic disclosure concerning the corporation which controls the registered insurer and the other companies in the holding company system and prior approval of intercorporate transfers of assets (including in some instances payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiary) within the holding company system. AIG's subsidiaries are registered under such legislation in those states which have such requirements.(See also Note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG's insurance subsidiaries, in common with other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and by other jurisdictions in which they do business. Within the United States, the method of such regulation varies but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory and supervisory powers to an insurance official. The regulation and supervision relate primarily to approval of policy forms and rates, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, including risk based capital measurements, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on investments, restrictions on the size of risks which may be insured under a single policy, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, methods of accounting, periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies, the form and content of reports of financial condition required to be filed, and reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than security holders. (See also Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nRisk Based Capital (RBC) is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. Thus, inadequately capitalized general and life insurance companies may be identified. The RBC formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. Higher factors are applied to more risky items and lower factors are applied to less risky items. Thus, the target level of statutory surplus varies not only as a result of the insurer's size, but also on the risk profile of the insurer's operations. The RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control. The statutory surplus of each of AIG's domestic general and life insurance subsidiaries exceeded their RBC standards by considerable margins as of December 31, 1999. To the extent that any of AIG's insurance entities would fall below prescribed levels of surplus, it would be AIG's intention to infuse necessary capital to support that entity. A substantial portion of AIG's general insurance business and a majority of its life insurance business is carried on in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies from minimal in some to stringent in others. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification or revocation by such authorities, and AIU or other AIG subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. In the past, AIU has been allowed to modify its operations to conform with new licensing requirements in most jurisdictions. In addition to licensing requirements, AIG's foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, policy language and terms, amount and type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of local investment and the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on participating policies. Some foreign countries regulate rates on various types of policies. Certain countries have established reinsurance institutions, wholly or partially owned by the state, to which admitted insurers are obligated to cede a portion of their business on terms which do not always allow foreign insurers, including AIG, full compensation. In some countries, regulations governing constitution of technical reserves and remittance balances may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets. The insurance industry is highly competitive. Within the United States, AIG's general insurance subsidiaries compete with approximately 3,000 other stock companies, specialty insurance organizations, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations. AIG's life insurance companies compete in the United States with some 1,700 life insurance companies and other participants in related financial service fields. Overseas, AIG subsidiaries compete for business with foreign insurance operations of the larger U.S. insurers and local companies in particular areas in which they are active. AIG's financial services subsidiaries, particularly AIGTG and AIGFP, operate in a highly competitive environment, both domestically and overseas. Principal sources of competition are banks, investment banks and other non-bank financial institutions.\"),\n",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\nOperational Review\\nGeneral Insurance Operations\\nAIG's general insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance. Domestic general insurance operations are comprised of the Domestic Brokerage Group (DBG), which includes the domestic operations of Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (Transatlantic), Personal Lines, including 21st Century Insurance Group (21st Century), and Mortgage Guaranty. Commencing with the third quarter of 1998, Transatlantic and 21st Century were consolidated into AIG's financial statements, as a result of AIG obtaining majority ownership. DBG is AIG's primary domestic division. DBG writes substantially all classes of business insurance, accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers. This provides DBG the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to submit business to DBG without the traditional agent-company contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no authority to commit DBG to accept a risk. Personal Lines engages in the mass marketing of personal lines insurance, primarily private passenger auto and includes homeowners and personal umbrella coverages. Mortgage Guaranty provides guaranty insurance on conventional first mortgage loans on single family dwellings and condominiums. AIG's Foreign General insurance group accepts risks primarily underwritten through American International Underwriters (AIU), a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned agencies and insurance entities. The Foreign General insurance group also includes business written by AIG's foreign-based insurance subsidiaries for their own accounts. The Foreign General insurance group uses various marketing methods to write both business and personal lines insurance with certain refinements for local laws, customs and needs. AIU operates in over 70 countries in Asia, the Pacific Rim, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America. Transatlantic's foreign operations are included in this group. (See also Note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nGeneral insurance operations for the twelve month periods ending December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 were as follows:\\nIn AIG's general insurance operations, 1999 net premiums written and net premiums earned increased 11.2 percent and 10.3 percent, respectively, from those of 1998. In 1998, net premiums written increased 8.8 percent and net premiums earned increased 13.5 percent when compared to 1997. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nGeneral insurance domestic net premiums written and net premiums earned were as follows:\\nDuring the latter part of 1999, the commercial insurance market began to experience some rate increases. However, this market remains competitive and excessively capitalized. DBG has been able to sustain some growth in various specialty markets, such as pollution, excess liability and risk management, where AIG provides cost effective coverages for large complex risks, underwriting flexibility, and creative risk financing solutions; however, in 1999 DBG declined to renew $450 million of domestic business where underwriting and pricing standards could not be achieved. Non-renewed policies were principally in the workers' compensation, traditional casualty and property lines of business. As reflected in the preceding table showing the distribution of net premiums written and net premiums earned, domestic growth was primarily achieved through the growth in the personal auto insurance segment of Personal Lines. Personal Lines net premiums written increased $740 million in 1999 over 1998, compared to an increase of $610 million in 1998 over 1997. The consolidation of 21st Century for twelve months in 1999 compared to six months in 1998 accounted for approximately 50 percent of the increase.\"),\n",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\", 'filename': '5272_1999.txt', 'cik': '0000005272', 'year': 1999, 'chunk_index': 1}, page_content='The balance of the increase was related to the significant growth in the number of policies issued with respect to preferred, standard and non-standard auto risks. Growth of 15.6 percent and 18.0 percent for foreign general insurance net premiums written and net premiums earned, respectively, in 1999 over 1998 reflect growth of operations in the United Kingdom, the Far East, and the consolidation of Transatlantic\\'s foreign operations for the twelve months in 1999 compared to six months in 1998. Foreign general insurance operations produced 34.2 percent of the general insurance net premiums written in 1999, 32.9 percent in 1998 and 32.6 percent in 1997. Differences in foreign exchange rates during 1999 relative to 1998 had a negligible effect on foreign general insurance net premiums written when translated from original currencies into U.S. dollars. (See also the discussion under \"Capital Resources\" herein.)\\nBecause of the nature and diversity of AIG\\'s operations and the continuing rapid changes in the insurance industry worldwide, together with the factors discussed above, it is difficult to assess further or project future growth in AIG\\'s net premiums written and reserve for losses and loss expenses. Net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies. The net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period. Thus, the net unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized as net premiums earned until the end of the policy period. AIG, along with most general insurance entities, uses the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of performance. The loss ratio is derived as the sum of losses and loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is derived as statutory underwriting expenses divided by net premiums written. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. These ratios are relative measurements that describe for every $100 of net premiums earned or written, the cost of losses and statutory expenses, respectively. The combined ratio presents the total cost per $100 of premium production. A combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit; a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting loss. The statutory general insurance ratios were as follows:\\nAIG believes that underwriting profit is the true measure of the performance of the core business of a general insurance company. Underwriting profit is measured in two ways: statutory underwriting profit and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) underwriting profit. Statutory underwriting profit is arrived at by reducing net premiums earned by net losses and loss expenses incurred and net expenses incurred. Statutory accounting differs from GAAP, as statutory accounting requires immediate expense recognition and ignores the matching of revenues and expenses as required by GAAP. That is, for statutory purposes, all expenses, most specifically acquisition expenses, are recognized immediately, not consistent with the revenues earned. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (CONTINUED)\\nA basic premise of GAAP accounting is the recognition of expenses at the same time revenues are earned, the principle of matching. Therefore, to convert underwriting results to a GAAP basis, acquisition expenses are deferred and recognized together with the related revenues. Accordingly, the statutory underwriting profit has been adjusted as a result of acquisition expenses being deferred as required by GAAP. Thus, \"adjusted underwriting profit\" is a GAAP measurement which can be viewed as gross margin or an intermediate subtotal in calculating operating income and net income. A major part of the discipline of a successful general insurance company is to produce an underwriting profit, exclusive of investment income. If underwriting is not profitable, losses incurred are a major factor. The result is that the premiums are inadequate to pay for losses and expenses and produce a profit; therefore, investment income must be used to cover underwriting losses. If assets and the income therefrom are insufficient to pay claims and expenses over extended periods, an insurance company cannot survive. For these reasons, AIG views and manages its underwriting operations separately from its investment operations. The adjusted underwriting profits were $669 million in 1999, $531 million in 1998 and $490 million in 1997. Domestic adjusted underwriting profit increased primarily as a result of the disciplined underwriting of DBG. Foreign underwriting profit declined primarily as a result of catastrophe losses from European storms. The regulatory, product type and competitive environment as well as the degree of litigation activity in any one country varies significantly.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'doc_id': '5272_1999.txt#section_7::chunk2', 'section_id': '5272_1999.txt#section_7', 'section': 'section_7', 'section_title': \"ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\", 'filename': '5272_1999.txt', 'cik': '0000005272', 'year': 1999, 'chunk_index': 2}, page_content='These factors have a direct impact on pricing and consequently profitability as reflected by adjusted underwriting profit and statutory general insurance ratios. (See also Notes 4 and 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG\\'s results reflect the net impact of incurred losses from catastrophes approximating $156 million in 1999, $110 million in 1998 and $16 million in 1997. AIG\\'s gross incurred losses from catastrophes approximated $472 million in 1999, $625 million in 1998 and $22 million in 1997. In 1999, the catastrophe losses resulted primarily from European storms. The impact of losses caused by catastrophes can fluctuate widely from year to year, making comparisons of recurring type business more difficult. The pro forma table below excludes catastrophe losses in order to present comparable results of AIG\\'s recurring core underwriting operations. The pro forma consolidated statutory general insurance ratios would be as follows:\\nAIG\\'s historic ability to maintain its combined ratio below 100 is primarily attributable to the profitability of AIG\\'s foreign general insurance operations and AIG\\'s emphasis on maintaining its disciplined underwriting, especially in the domestic specialty markets. In 1999, the discipline in domestic underwriting was critical in maintaining underwriting profit as the foreign general combined ratio rose because of the impact of catastrophe losses. In addition, AIG does not seek net premium growth where rates do not adequately reflect its assessment of exposures. General insurance net investment income in 1999 increased 14.8 percent when compared to 1998. In 1998, net investment income increased 18.3 percent over 1997. The growth in net investment income in each of the three years was primarily attributable to new cash flow for investment and the consolidation of Transatlantic and 21st Century for twelve months in 1999 compared to six months in 1998. The new cash flow was generated from net general insurance operating cash flow and included the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income. (See also the discussion under \"Liquidity\" herein and Note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nGeneral insurance realized capital gains were $295 million in 1999, $205 million in 1998 and $128 million in 1997. These realized gains resulted from the ongoing management of the general insurance investment portfolios within the overall objectives of the general insurance operations and arose primarily from the disposition of equity securities and available for sale fixed maturities as well as redemptions of fixed maturities. General insurance operating income in 1999 increased 18.9 percent when compared to 1998. The 1998 results reflect an increase of 18.4 percent from 1997. The contribution of general insurance operating income to income before income taxes and minority interest was 46.3 percent in 1999 compared to 46.6 percent in 1998 and 1997. AIG is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its general insurance operations. AIG is cognizant of the need to exercise good judgment in the selection and approval of both domestic and foreign companies participating in its reinsurance programs. AIG insures risks in over 70 countries and its reinsurance programs must be coordinated in order to provide AIG the level of reinsurance protection that AIG desires. These reinsurance arrangements do not relieve AIG from its direct obligations to its insureds. AIG\\'s general reinsurance assets amounted to $19.13 billion and resulted from AIG\\'s reinsurance arrangements. Thus, a credit exposure existed at December 31, 1999 with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer may not be able to reimburse AIG under the terms of these reinsurance arrangements. AIG manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound, and when necessary AIG holds substantial collateral in the form of funds, securities and/or irrevocable letters of credit.

Thus, the subsequent payment of these personal lines claims is significantly faster as these claims are deemed short tail lines, as described below. The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance. The methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in operating income currently. It is management's belief that the general insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover all general insurance net losses and loss expenses as at December 31, 1999. In the future, if the general insurance net loss reserves develop deficiently, such deficiency would have an adverse impact on such future results of operations. In a very broad sense, the general loss reserves can be categorized into two distinct groups: one group being long tail casualty lines of business. Such lines include excess and umbrella liability, directors and officers' liability, professional liability, medical malpractice, general liability, products' liability, and related classes. These lines account for approximately one-half of net losses and loss expenses. The other group is short tail lines of business consisting principally of property lines, certain classes of casualty lines and includes personal lines. Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses (net losses) for long tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the line and volume of the business involved. In the more recent accident years of long tail casualty lines there is limited statistical credibility in reported net losses. That is, a relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims and expenses and an even smaller proportion would be net losses paid. A relatively high proportion of net losses would therefore be IBNR. A variety of actuarial methods and assumptions are normally employed to estimate net losses for long tail casualty lines. These methods ordinarily involve the use of loss trend factors intended to reflect the estimated annual growth in loss costs from one accident year to the next. For the majority of long tail casualty lines, net loss trend factors approximated five percent. Loss trend factors reflect many items including changes in claims handling, exposure and policy forms and current and future estimates of monetary inflation and social inflation. Thus, many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the year to year growth in loss costs. Therefore, AIG's carried net long tail loss reserves are judgmentally set as well as tested for reasonableness using the most appropriate loss trend factors for each class of business. In the evaluation of AIG's net loss reserves, loss trend factors vary slightly, depending on the particular class and nature of the business involved. These factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss experience. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (CONTINUED)\\nEstimation of net losses for short tail business is less complex than for long tail casualty lines. Loss cost trends for many property lines can generally be assumed to be similar to the growth in exposure of such lines. For example, if the fire insurance coverage remained proportional to the actual value of the property, the growth in property's exposure to fire loss can be approximated by the amount of insurance purchased. For other property and short tail casualty lines, the loss trend is implicitly assumed to grow at the rate that reported net losses grow from one year to the next. The concerns noted above for longer tail casualty lines with respect to the limited statistical credibility of reported net losses generally do not apply to shorter tail lines. AIG continues to receive claims asserting injuries from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites (hereinafter referred to collectively as environmental claims) and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. The vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. AIG established a specialized claims unit which investigates and adjusts all such asbestos and environmental claims. Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained an absolute exclusion for pollution related damage. However, AIG currently underwrites environmental impairment liability insurance on a claims made basis and excluded such claims from the analyses included herein. Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a difficult process. These asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated by conventional reserving techniques as previously described. Quantitative techniques frequently have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including managerial judgment. Significant factors which affect the trends which influence the development of asbestos and environmental claims are the inconsistent court resolutions and judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage. The current case law can be characterized as still evolving and there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop in the near future.\"),\n",

The cleanup cost exposure may significantly change if the Congressional reauthorization of Superfund dramatically changes, thereby reducing or increasing litigation and cleanup costs. Additionally, proposed legislation, if passed in current form, would be expected to reduce ultimate asbestos exposure. In the interim, AIG and other industry members have and will continue to litigate the broadening judicial interpretation of the policy coverage and the liability issues. At the current time, it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the same degree of reliability as is the case for other types of claims. Such development will be affected by the extent to which courts continue to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage, as they have in the past, as well as by changes in Superfund and waste dump site coverage issues. Although the estimated liabilities for these claims are subject to a significantly greater margin of error than for other claims, the reserves carried for these claims at December 31, 1999 are believed to be adequate as these reserves are based on the known facts and current law. Furthermore, as AIG's net exposure retained relative to the gross exposure written was lower in 1984 and prior years, the potential impact of these claims is much smaller on the net loss reserves than on the gross loss reserves. (See the previous discussion on reinsurance collectibility herein.)\\nThe majority of AIG's exposures for asbestos and environmental claims are excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. Thus, the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity reserves. That is, litigation expenses are included within the limits of the liability AIG incurs. Individual significant claim liabilities, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case basis. A summary of reserve activity, including estimates for applicable IBNR, relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined at December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 follows.

Best, an insurance rating agency, has developed a survival ratio to measure the number of years it would take a company to exhaust both its asbestos and environmental reserves for losses and loss expenses based on that company's current level of asbestos and environmental claims payments. This is a ratio derived by taking the current ending losses and loss expense reserves and dividing by the average annual payments for the prior three years. Therefore, the ratio derived is a simplistic measure of an estimate of the number of years it would be before the current ending losses and loss expense reserves would be paid off using recent average payments. The higher the ratio, the more years the reserves for losses and loss expenses cover these claims payments. These ratios are computed based on the ending reserves for losses and loss expenses over the respective claims settlements during the fiscal year. Such payments include indemnity payments and legal and loss adjustment payments. It should be noted, however, that this is an extremely simplistic approach to measuring asbestos and environmental reserve levels. Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have significant impact on the amount of asbestos and environmental losses and loss expense reserves, ultimate payments thereof and the resultant ratio. The developed survival ratios include both involuntary and voluntary indemnity payments. Involuntary payments are primarily attributable to court judgments, court orders, covered claims with no coverage defenses, state mandated cleanup costs, claims where AIG's coverage defenses are minimal, and settlements made less than six months before trial. Also, AIG considers all legal and loss adjustment payments as involuntary. AIG believes voluntary indemnity payments should be excluded from the survival ratio. The special asbestos and environmental claims unit actively manages AIG's asbestos and environmental claims and proactively pursues early settlement of environmental claims for all known and unknown sites. As a result, AIG reduces its exposure to future environmental loss contingencies. AIG's survival ratios for involuntary asbestos and environmental claims, separately and combined, were based upon a three year average payment. These ratios for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 were as follows:\\nAIG's operations are negatively impacted under guarantee fund assessment laws which exist in most states. As a result of operating in a state which has guarantee fund assessment laws, a solvent insurance company may be assessed for certain obligations arising from the insolvencies of other insurance companies which operated in that state. AIG generally records these assessments upon notice. Additionally, certain states permit at least a portion of the assessed amount to be used as a credit against a company's future premium tax liabilities.\"),\n",

The sale of these operations did not have a significant impact on AIG\\'s results of operations. AIG Consumer Finance Group, Inc., through its subsidiaries, is engaged in developing a multi-product consumer finance business with an emphasis on emerging markets. Asset Management Operations\\nAIG\\'s asset management operations offer a wide variety of investment vehicles and services, including variable annuities, mutual funds, and investment asset management. Such products and services are offered to individuals and institutions both domestically and internationally. AIG\\'s three principal asset management operations are SunAmerica\\'s asset management operations (SAAMCo), AIG Global Investment Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Global Investment) and AIG Capital Partners, Inc. (Cap Partners). SAAMCo develops and sells variable annuities and other investment products, sells and manages mutual funds and provides financial services. Global Investment manages invested assets of institutions, including insurance companies and pension funds, and provides custodial services. Cap Partners organizes, and manages the invested assets of institutional investment funds and may also invest in such funds. Each of these subsidiary operations receives fees for investment products and services provided. Asset management operations for the twelve month periods ending December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 were as follows:\\nThese increases were primarily attributable to increased fees from the management of the variable annuity business and mutual fund assets by SAAMCo. Asset management operating income increased 64.3 percent in 1999 over 1998. This compares with an increase of 50.4 percent in 1998 over 1997. Asset management operating income represented 4.2 percent of AIG\\'s income before income taxes and minority interest in 1999. This compares to 3.0 percent and 2.4 percent in 1998 and 1997, respectively. Other Operations\\nIn 1998, AIG\\'s equity in income of minority-owned insurance operations was $57 million compared to $114 million in 1997. In 1998, the equity interest in insurance companies represented 0.9 percent of income before income taxes and minority interest compared to 2.1 percent in 1997. In 1999, AIG did not report equity in income of minority-owned insurance operations as a result of the consolidation of Transatlantic\\'s and SELIC Holdings, Ltd. operations into general insurance operating results. IPC Holdings, Ltd., the remaining operation included in equity in income of minority-owned insurance operations in previous periods is now reported as a component of other income (deductions)--net. Other realized capital losses amounted to $25 million, $7 million and $29 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (CONTINUED)\\nOther income (deductions)--net includes AIG\\'s equity in certain minor majority-owned subsidiaries and certain partially-owned companies, realized foreign exchange transaction gains and losses in substantially all currencies and unrealized gains and losses in hyperinflationary currencies, costs associated with the Year 2000 computer issues, as well as the income and expenses of the parent holding company and other miscellaneous income and expenses.

At December 31, 1999, ILFC had $1.68 billion in aggregate principal amount of debt securities registered for issuance from time to time. In addition, ILFC established a Euro Medium Term Note Program for $2.0 billion, under which $771 million in notes were sold through December 31, 1999. ILFC has an Export Credit Facility up to a maximum of $4.3 billion, for approximately 75 aircraft to be delivered from 1999 through 2001. ILFC has the right, but is not required, to use the facility to fund 85 percent of each aircraft\\'s purchase price. This facility is guaranteed by various European Export Credit Agencies.

Retained earnings increased $3.93 billion, resulting from net income less dividends. During 1999 and prior to the five for four split in the form of a 25 percent common stock dividend, AIG repurchased in the open market 931,000 shares of its common stock. Subsequent to the common stock dividend, AIG repurchased 11,633,200 shares of its common stock. AIG intends to continue to buy its common shares in the open market for general corporate purposes, including to satisfy its obligations under various employee benefit plans. Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by statutory authorities. AIG has in the past reinvested most of its unrestricted earnings in its operations and believes such continued reinvestment in the future will be adequate to meet any foreseeable capital needs. However, AIG may choose from time to time to raise additional funds through the issuance of additional securities. At December 31, 1999, there were no significant statutory or regulatory issues which would impair AIG\\'s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. To AIG\\'s knowledge, no AIG company is on any regulatory or similar \"watch list\". (See also the discussion under \"Liquidity\" herein and Note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has developed Risk-Based Capital (RBC) requirements. RBC relates an individual insurance company\\'s statutory surplus to the risk inherent in its overall operations. At December 31, 1999, the adjusted capital of each of AIG\\'s domestic general companies and of each of AIG\\'s domestic life companies exceeded each of their RBC standards by considerable margins. A substantial portion of AIG\\'s general insurance business and a majority of its life insurance business are conducted in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies from minimal in some to stringent in others. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (CONTINUED)\\nLiquidity\\nAIG\\'s liquidity is primarily derived from the operating cash flows of its general and life insurance operations. At December 31, 1999, AIG\\'s consolidated invested assets included $7.14 billion of cash and short-term investments. Consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in 1999 amounted to $10.32 billion. Sources of funds considered in meeting the objectives of AIG\\'s financial services operations include guaranteed investment agreements, issuance of long and short-term debt, maturities and sales of securities available for sale, securities sold under repurchase agreements, trading liabilities, securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased, issuance of equity, and cash provided from such operations. AIG\\'s strong capital position is integral to managing this liquidity, as it enables AIG to raise funds in diverse markets worldwide. (See also the discussions under \"Capital Resources\" herein.)\\nManagement believes that AIG\\'s liquid assets, its net cash provided by operations, and access to the capital markets will enable it to meet any foreseeable cash requirements. The liquidity of the combined insurance operations is derived both domestically and abroad. The combined insurance operating cash flow is derived from two sources, underwriting operations and investment operations. In the aggregate, AIG\\'s insurance operations generated approximately $18 billion in pre-tax cash flow during 1999. Cash flow includes periodic premium collections, including policyholders\\' contract deposits, paid loss recoveries less reinsurance premiums, losses, benefits, acquisition and operating expenses. Generally, there is a time lag from when premiums are collected and, when as a result of the occurrence of events specified in the policy, the losses and benefits are paid. AIG\\'s insurance investment operations generated approximately $8.6 billion in investment income cash flow during 1999. Investment income cash flow is primarily derived from interest and dividends received and includes realized capital gains net of realized capital losses. In addition to the combined insurance pre-tax operating cash flow, AIG\\'s insurance operations held $6.69 billion in cash and short-term investments at December 31, 1999. The aforementioned operating cash flow and the cash and short-term balances held provided AIG\\'s insurance operations with a significant amount of liquidity. This liquidity is available, among other things, to purchase high quality and diversified fixed income securities and to a lesser extent equity securities and to provide mortgage loans on real estate, policy loans and collateral loans. This cash flow coupled with proceeds of approximately $40 billion from the maturities, sales and redemptions of fixed income securities and from the sale of equity securities was used to purchase approximately $54 billion of fixed income securities and equity securities during 1999. The following table is a summary of AIG\\'s invested assets by significant segment, including investment income due and accrued of $2.05 billion and $1.87 billion and real estate of $1.62 billion and $1.61 billion, at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively:\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nInsurance Invested Assets\\nThe following tables summarize the composition of AIG\\'s insurance invested assets by insurance segment, including investment income due and accrued and real estate, at December 31, 1999 and 1998:\\n(a) Includes $1.04 billion of bonds trading securities, at market value.

(b) Includes $593 million of non-redeemable preferred stocks, at market value. Generally, insurance regulations restrict the types of assets in which an insurance company may invest. With respect to fixed maturities, AIG\\'s general strategy is to invest in high quality securities while maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure to issuer, industry and/or country concentrations. With respect to general insurance, AIG\\'s strategy is to invest in longer duration fixed maturities to maximize the yields at the date of purchase. With respect to life insurance, AIG\\'s strategy is to produce cash flows required to meet maturing insurance liabilities (See also the discussion under \"Operational Review: Life Insurance Operations\" herein.)\\nThe fixed maturity available for sale portfolio is subject to decline in fair value as interest rates rise. Such declines in fair value are presented as a component of comprehensive income in unrealized appreciation of investments, net of taxes. The fixed maturities held to maturity portfolio is exposed to adverse interest rate fluctuations. However, AIG has the ability and intent to hold such securities to maturity. Therefore, there would be no detrimental impact to AIG\\'s results of operations or financial condition as a result of such fluctuations. At December 31, 1999, approximately 59.8 percent of the fixed maturities investments were domestic securities. Approximately 36 percent of such domestic securities were rated AAA. Approximately 12 percent were below investment grade or not rated. A significant portion of the foreign insurance fixed income portfolio is rated by Moody\\'s, Standard & Poor\\'s (S&P) or similar foreign services. Similar credit quality rating services are not available in all overseas locations. AIG annually reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio nonrated fixed income investments, including mortgages. At December 31, 1999, approximately 15 percent of the foreign fixed income investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of AIG\\'s internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities so rated. Approximately 13 percent were below investment grade or not rated at that date.'),\n",

Substantially all of the CMOs were investment grade and approximately 18 percent of the CMOs were backed by various U.S. government agencies. CMOs are exposed to interest rate risk as the duration and ultimate realized yield would be affected by the accelerated prepayments of the underlying mortgages. Any fixed income security may be subject to downgrade for a variety of reasons subsequent to any balance sheet date. AIG invests in equities for reasons including diversifying its overall exposure to interest rate risk. Equity securities are subject to declines in fair value. Such declines in fair value are presented in unrealized appreciation of investments, net of taxes as components of comprehensive income. Mortgage loans on real estate, policy and collateral loans comprised 8.3 percent of AIG\\'s insurance invested assets at December 31, 1999. AIG\\'s insurance operations\\' holdings of real estate mortgages amounted to $6.64 billion of which 74.6 percent was domestic. At December 31, 1999, only a nominal amount were in default. It is AIG\\'s practice to maintain a maximum loan to value ratio of 75 percent at loan origination. At December 31, 1999, AIG\\'s insurance holdings of collateral loans amounted to $1.03 billion, all of which were foreign. It is AIG\\'s strategy to enter into mortgage and collateral loans as an adjunct primarily to life insurance fixed maturity investments. AIG\\'s policy loans increased from $2.63 billion at December 31, 1998 to $2.82 billion at December 31, 1999. Short-term investments represent amounts invested in various internal and external money market funds, time deposits and cash held. AIG\\'s real estate investment properties are primarily occupied by AIG\\'s various operations. The current market value of these properties considerably exceeds their carrying value. Other invested assets were primarily comprised of both foreign and domestic private placements, limited partnerships and outside managed funds. When permitted by regulatory authorities and when deemed necessary to protect insurance assets, including invested assets, from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, AIG and its insurance subsidiaries may enter into derivative transactions as end users. To date, such activities have not been significant. (See also the discussion under \"Derivatives\" herein.)\\nIn certain jurisdictions, significant regulatory and/or foreign governmental barriers exist which may not permit the immediate free flow of funds between insurance subsidiaries or from the insurance subsidiaries to AIG parent. These barriers generally cause only minor delays in the outward remittance of the funds. AIG\\'s insurance operations are exposed to market risk. Market risk is the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices. Measuring potential losses in fair values has recently become the focus of risk management efforts by many companies. Such measurements are performed through the application of various statistical techniques. One such technique is Value at Risk (VaR). VaR is a summary statistical measure that uses historical interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices and estimates the volatility and correlation of each of these rates and prices to calculate the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time given a certain probability. AIG believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk. While VaR models are relatively sophisticated, the quantitative market risk information generated is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related models. Therefore, such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management. AIG has performed a VaR analysis to estimate the maximum potential loss of fair value for each of AIG\\'s insurance segments and for each market risk within each insurance segment. In this analysis, financial instrument assets include the domestic and foreign invested assets excluding real estate and investment income due and accrued. Financial instrument liabilities include reserve for losses and loss expenses, reserve for unearned premiums, future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and policyholders\\' funds. Due to the nature of each insurance segment, AIG manages the general and life insurance operations separately. As a result, AIG manages separately the invested assets of each. Accordingly, the VaR analysis was separately performed for the general and the life insurance operations. AIG calculated the VaR with respect to the net fair value of each of AIG\\'s insurance segments as of December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998. These calculations used the variance-covariance (delta-normal) methodology.'),\n",

As of March 8, 2000, ILFC has entered into leases for all of the aircraft to be delivered in 2000 and 100 of 280 aircraft to be delivered subsequent to 2000. ILFC will be required to find customers for any aircraft presently on order and any aircraft to be ordered, and it must arrange financing for portions of the purchase price of such equipment. In a rising interest rate environment, ILFC negotiates higher lease rates on any new contracts. ILFC has been successful to date both in placing its new aircraft on lease or under sales contract and obtaining adequate financing. ILFC is exposed to market risk and the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates. As of December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998, AIG statistically measured the aforementioned loss of fair value through the application of a VaR model. In this analysis, the net fair value of ILFC was determined using the financial instrument assets which included the tax adjusted future flight equipment lease revenue and the financial instrument liabilities which included the future servicing of the current debt. The estimated impact of the current derivative positions was also taken into account. AIG calculated the VaR with respect to the net fair value of ILFC using the variance-covariance (delta-normal) methodology. This calculation also used daily historical interest rates for the two years ending December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998.'),\n",

AIGFP\\'s derivative transactions are carried at market value or at estimated fair value when market prices are not readily available. AIGFP reduces its economic risk exposure through similarly valued offsetting transactions including swaps, trading securities, options, forwards and futures. The estimated fair values of these transactions represent assessments of the present value of expected future cash flows. These transactions are exposed to liquidity risk if AIGFP were to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes that the impact of any such limited liquidity would not be significant to AIG\\'s financial condition or its overall liquidity. (See also the discussion under \"Operational Review: Financial Services Operations\" and \"Derivatives\" herein.)\\nAIGFP uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes and bonds and GIA borrowings to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities, including securities available for sale, at market, and derivative transactions. The funds may also be temporarily invested in securities purchased under agreements to resell. The proceeds from the disposal of the aforementioned securities available for sale and securities purchased under agreements to resell have been used to fund the maturing GIAs or other AIGFP financings. (See also the discussion under \"Capital Resources\" herein.)\\nSecurities available for sale is mainly a portfolio of debt securities, where the individual securities have varying degrees of credit risk. At December 31, 1999, the average credit rating of this portfolio was AA or the equivalent thereto as determined through rating agencies or internal review. AIGFP has also entered into credit derivative transactions to hedge its credit risk associated with $182 million of these securities. There were no securities deemed below investment grade at December 31, 1999.'),\n",

Securities purchased under agreements to resell are treated as collateralized transactions. AIGFP takes possession of or obtains a security interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell. AIGFP further minimizes its credit risk by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and, when AIGFP deems necessary, it requires additional collateral to be deposited. Trading securities, at market value are marked to market daily and are held to meet the short-term risk management objectives of AIGFP. AIGTG conducts, as principal, market making and trading activities in foreign exchange, interest rates and precious and base metals. AIGTG owns inventories in the commodities in which it trades and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the use of swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts. AIGTG uses derivatives to manage the economic exposure of its various trading positions and transactions from adverse movements of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. AIGTG supports its trading activities largely through trading liabilities, unrealized losses on swaps, short-term borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities and commodities sold but not yet purchased. (See also the discussions under \"Capital Resources\" and \"Derivatives\" herein.)\\nThe gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses of AIGFP and AIGTG included in the financial services assets and liabilities at December 31, 1999 were as follows:\\n(a) See also Note 8(e) of Notes to Financial Statements. (b) These amounts are also presented as the respective balance sheet amounts. (c) At December 31, 1999, AIGTG\\'s replacement values with respect to interest rate and currency swaps were $315 million. AIGFP\\'s interest rate and currency risks on securities available for sale, at market, are managed by taking offsetting positions on a security by security basis, thereby offsetting a significant portion of the unrealized appreciation or depreciation. At December 31, 1999, the unrealized gains and losses remaining after the benefit of the offsets were $39 million and $5 million, respectively. Trading securities, at market value, and securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased, at market value are marked to market daily with the unrealized gain or loss being recognized in income at that time. These securities are held to meet the short-term risk management objectives of AIGFP and AIGTG. The senior management of AIG defines the policies and establishes general operating parameters for AIGFP and AIGTG. AIG\\'s senior management has established various oversight committees to review the various financial market, operational and credit issues of AIGFP and AIGTG. The senior managements of AIGFP and AIGTG report the results of their respective operations to and review future strategies with AIG\\'s senior management. AIG actively manages the exposures to limit potential losses, while maximizing the rewards afforded by these business opportunities. In doing so, AIG must manage a variety of exposures including credit, market, liquidity, operational and legal risks. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nMarket risk arises principally from the uncertainty that future earnings are exposed to potential changes in volatility, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices. AIG generally controls its exposure to market risk by taking offsetting positions. AIG\\'s philosophy with respect to its financial services operations is to minimize or set limits for open or uncovered positions that are to be carried. Credit risk exposure is separately managed. (See the discussion on the management of credit risk below.)\\nAIG\\'s Market Risk Management Department provides detailed independent review of AIG\\'s market exposures, particularly those market exposures of AIGFP and AIGTG. This department determines whether AIG\\'s market risks, as well as those market risks of individual subsidiaries, are within the parameters established by AIG\\'s senior management. Well established market risk management techniques such as sensitivity analysis are used. Additionally, this department verifies that specific market risks of each of certain subsidiaries are managed and hedged by that subsidiary. AIGFP is exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of interest rates and the shape and slope of the yield curve. AIGFP hedges its exposure to interest rate risk by entering into transactions such as interest rate swaps and options and purchasing U.S. and foreign government obligations. AIGFP is exposed to market risk due to changes in and volatility of foreign currency exchange rates. AIGFP hedges its foreign currency exchange risk primarily through the use of currency swaps, options, forwards and futures. AIGFP is exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of equity prices which affect the value of securities or instruments that derive their value from a particular stock, a basket of stocks or a stock index. AIGFP reduces the risk of loss inherent in its inventory in equity securities by entering into hedging transactions, including equity swaps and options and purchasing U.S. and foreign government obligations. AIGFP does not seek to manage the market risk of each of its transactions through an individual offsetting transaction. Rather, AIGFP takes a portfolio approach to the management of its market risk exposure. AIGFP values its portfolio at market value or estimated fair value when market values are not readily available. These valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows of AIGFP\\'s transactions and may include reserves for such risks as are deemed appropriate by AIGFP\\'s and AIG\\'s management. AIGFP evaluates the portfolio\\'s discounted cash flows with reference to current market conditions, maturities within the portfolio and other relevant factors. Based upon this evaluation, AIGFP determines what, if any, offsetting transactions are necessary to reduce the market risk exposure of the portfolio. The aforementioned estimated fair values are based upon the use of valuation models. These models utilize, among other things, current interest, foreign exchange and volatility rates.'),\n",

Additionally, AIGFP operates in major business centers overseas and is essentially open for business 24 hours a day. Thus, the market exposure and offset strategies are monitored, reviewed and coordinated around the clock. Therefore, offsetting adjustments can be made as and when necessary from any AIGFP office in the world. As part of its monitoring and controlling of its exposure to market risk, AIGFP applies various testing techniques which reflect potential market movements. These techniques vary by currency and are regularly changed to reflect factors affecting the derivatives portfolio. In addition to the daily monitoring, AIGFP's senior management and local risk managers conduct a weekly review of the derivatives portfolio and existing hedges. This review includes an examination of the portfolio's risk measures, such as aggregate option sensitivity to movements in market variables. AIGFP's management may change these measures to reflect their judgment and evaluation of the dynamics of the markets. This management group will also determine whether additional or alternative action is required in order to manage the portfolio. AIG's Market Risk Management Department reviews AIGFP's transactions in order to provide comfort to AIG's senior management that the system produces representative values. All of AIGTG's market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for trading purposes. The fair values of AIGTG's financial instruments are exposed to market risk as a result of adverse market changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and adverse changes in the liquidity of the markets in which AIGTG trades. AIGTG's approach to managing market risk is to establish an appropriate offsetting position to a particular transaction or group of transactions depending upon the extent of market risk AIGTG expects to reduce. AIGTG's senior management has established positions and stop-loss limits for each line of business. AIGTG's traders are required to maintain positions within these limits. These positions are monitored during the day either manually and/or through on-line computer systems. In addition, these positions are reviewed by AIGTG's management. Reports which present each trading books position and the prior day's profit and loss are reviewed by traders, head traders and AIGTG's senior management. Based upon these and other reports, AIGTG's senior management may determine to adjust AIGTG's risk profile. AIGTG attempts to secure reliable current market prices, such as published prices or third party quotes, to value its derivatives. Where such prices are not available, AIGTG uses\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (CONTINUED)\\nan internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions. The methodology may reflect interest and exchange rates, commodity prices, volatility rates and other relevant factors. A significant portion of AIGTG's business is transacted in liquid markets. Certain of AIGTG's derivative product exposures are evaluated using simulation techniques which consider such factors as changes in currency and commodity prices, interest rates, volatility levels and the effect of time. Though not indicative of the future, past volatile market scenarios have represented profit opportunities for AIGTG. AIGFP and AIGTG are both exposed to the risk of loss of fair value from adverse fluctuations in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices. AIG statistically measured the losses of fair value through the application of a VaR model. AIG separately calculated the VaR with respect to AIGFP and AIGTG, as AIG manages these operations separately. AIGFP's and AIGTG's asset and liability portfolios for which the VaR analyses were performed included over the counter and exchange traded investments, derivative instruments and commodities. Since the market risk with respect to securities available for sale, at market is substantially hedged, segregation of market sensitive instruments into trading and other than trading was not deemed necessary. AIG calculated the VaR with respect to AIGFP and AIGTG as of December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998. These calculations used the variance-covariance (delta-normal) methodology.\"),\n",

The results depict the maximum potential loss in fair value at a confidence level of 95 percent. Given the distinct business strategies at AIGFP and AIGTG, the VaR calculations used different time periods to measure market exposures. Many of AIGFP\\'s customized, longer-term contracts may require several days to transact and hedge. AIG therefore used a one month holding period to measure market exposures for AIGFP. The large majority of AIGTG\\'s contracts can be arranged and hedged within one day. AIG therefore used a one day holding period to measure market exposures at AIGTG.

(b) A one day holding period was used to measure the market exposures of AIGTG. The average combined VaRs for 1999 were approximately $25 million and $5 million for AIGFP and AIGTG, respectively.

Derivatives\\nDerivatives are financial arrangements among two or more parties whose returns are linked to or \"derived\" from some underlying equity, debt, commodity or other asset, liability, or index. Derivatives payments may be based on interest rates and exchange rates and/or prices of certain securities, certain commodities, or financial or commodity indices. The more significant types of derivative arrangements in which AIG transacts are swaps, forwards, futures, options and related instruments. The most commonly used swaps are interest rate swaps, currency swaps, equity swaps and swaptions.'),\n",

An interest rate swap is a contract between two parties to exchange interest rate payments (typically a fixed interest rate versus a variable interest rate) calculated on a notional principal amount for a specified period of time. The notional amount is not exchanged. Currency and equity swaps are similar to interest rate swaps but may involve the exchange of principal amounts at the commencement and termination of the swap. Swaptions are options where the holder has the right but not the obligation to enter into a swap transaction or cancel an existing swap transaction. A futures or forward contract is a legal contract between two parties to purchase or sell at a specified future date a specified quantity of a commodity, security, currency, financial index or other instrument, at a specified price. A futures contract is traded on an exchange, while a forward contract is executed over the counter. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nOver the counter derivatives are not transacted in an exchange traded environment. The futures exchanges maintain considerable financial requirements and surveillance to ensure the integrity of exchange traded futures and options. An option contract generally provides the option purchaser with the right but not the obligation to buy or sell during a period of time or at a specified date the underlying instrument at a set price. The option writer is obligated to sell or buy the underlying item if the option purchaser chooses to exercise his right. The option writer receives a nonrefundable fee or premium paid by the option purchaser. Options may be traded over the counter or on an exchange. Derivatives are generally either negotiated over the counter contracts or standardized contracts executed on an exchange. Standardized exchange traded derivatives include futures and options which can be readily bought or sold over recognized security or commodity exchanges and settled daily through such clearing houses. Negotiated over the counter derivatives include forwards, swaps and options. Over the counter derivatives are generally not traded like exchange traded securities and the terms of over the counter derivatives are non-standard and unique to each contract. However, in the normal course of business, with the agreement of the original counterparty, these contracts may be terminated early or assigned to another counterparty. All significant derivatives activities are conducted through AIGFP and AIGTG permitting AIG to participate in the derivatives dealer market acting primarily as principal. In these derivative operations, AIG structures agreements which generally allow its counterparties to enter into transactions with respect to changes in interest and exchange rates, securities\\' prices and certain commodities and financial or commodity indices. Generally, derivatives are used by AIG\\'s customers such as corporations, financial institutions, multinational organizations, sovereign entities, government agencies and municipalities. For example, a futures, forward or option contract can be used to protect the customers\\' assets or liabilities against price fluctuations. A counterparty may default on any obligation to AIG, including a derivative contract. Credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and/or carrying trading and investment positions. Credit risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has an estimated positive fair value. To help manage this risk, the credit departments of AIGFP and AIGTG operate within the guidelines of the AIG Credit Risk Committee, which sets credit policy and limits for counterparties and provides limits for derivative transactions with counterparties having different credit ratings. In addition to credit ratings, this committee takes into account other factors, including the industry and country of the counterparty. Transactions which fall outside these pre-established guidelines require the approval of the AIG Credit Risk Committee. It is also AIG\\'s policy to establish reserves for potential credit impairment when necessary. AIGFP and AIGTG determine the credit quality of each of their counterparties taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized statistical rating organizations. If it is determined that a counterparty requires credit enhancement, then one or more enhancement techniques will be used. Examples of such enhancement techniques include letters of credit, guarantees, collateral credit triggers and credit derivatives and margin agreements. A significant majority of AIGFP\\'s transactions are contracted and documented under ISDA Master Agreements that provide for legally enforceable set-off in the event of default. Also, under such agreements, in connection with a counterparty desiring to terminate a contract prior to maturity, AIGFP may be permitted to set-off its receivables from that counterparty against AIGFP\\'s payables to that same counterparty arising out of all included transactions. Excluding regulated exchange transactions, AIGTG, whenever possible, enters into netting agreements with its counterparties which are similar in effect to those discussed above. The following tables provide the notional and contractual amounts of AIGFP\\'s and AIGTG\\'s derivatives transactions at December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998. The notional amounts used to express the extent of AIGFP\\'s and AIGTG\\'s involvement in swap transactions represent a standard of measurement of the volume of AIGFP\\'s and AIGTG\\'s swaps business. Notional amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and it may not necessarily be recorded on the balance sheet. Notional amounts represent those amounts used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received, except for certain contracts such as currency swaps. The timing and the amount of cash flows relating to AIGFP\\'s and AIGTG\\'s foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures and options contracts are determined by each of the respective contractual agreements. The net replacement value most closely represents the net credit risk to AIGFP or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss after the application of the aforementioned strategies, set-off and netting under ISDA Master Agreements and collateral held. Prior to the application of these credit enhancements, the gross credit risk with respect to these derivative instruments was $16.90 billion at December 31, 1999. Subsequent to the application of such credit enhancements, the net exposure to credit risk or the net replacement value of all interest rate, currency and equity swaps, swaptions and forward commitments at December 31, 1999, approximated $7.53 billion. The net replacement value for futures and forward contracts at December 31, 1999, approximated $5 million.

Generally, AIG manages and operates its businesses in the currencies of the local operating environment. Thus, exchange gains or losses occur when AIG\\'s foreign currency net investment is affected by changes in the foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar from one reporting period to the next. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nAIG, through its Foreign Exchange Operating Committee, evaluates each of its worldwide consolidated foreign currency net asset or liability positions and manages AIG\\'s translation exposure to adverse movement in currency exchange rates. AIG may use forward exchange contracts and purchase options where the cost of such is reasonable and markets are liquid to reduce these exchange translation exposures. The exchange gain or loss with respect to these hedging instruments is recorded on an accrual basis as a component of comprehensive income in capital funds. As an end user, AIG and its subsidiaries, including its insurance subsidiaries, use derivatives to aid in managing AIG\\'s foreign exchange translation exposure. Derivatives may also be used to minimize certain exposures with respect to AIG\\'s debt financing and its insurance operations; to date, such activities have not been significant. AIG has formed a Derivatives Review Committee. This committee, with certain exceptions, provides an independent review of any proposed derivative transaction. The committee examines, among other things, the nature and purpose of the derivative transaction, its potential credit exposure, if any, and the estimated benefits. This committee does not review those derivative transactions entered into by AIGFP and AIGTG for their own accounts. Legal risk arises from the uncertainty of the enforceability, through legal or judicial processes, of the obligations of AIG\\'s clients and counterparties, including contractual provisions intended to reduce credit exposure by providing for the netting of mutual obligations. (See also the discussion on master netting agreements above.) AIG seeks to eliminate or minimize such uncertainty through continuous consultation with internal and external legal advisors, both domestically and abroad, in order to understand the nature of legal risk, to improve documentation and to strengthen transaction structure. Accounting Standards\\nIn June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130 \"Reporting Comprehensive Income\" (FASB 130) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 \"Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information\" (FASB 131). FASB 130 establishes standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements. FASB 130 was effective for AIG as of January 1, 1998. FASB 131 establishes standards for the way AIG is required to disclose certain information about its operating segments in its annual financial statements and certain selected information in its interim financial statements. FASB 131 establishes, where practicable, standards with respect to geographic areas, among other things. Certain descriptive information is also required. FASB 131 was effective for the year ended December 31, 1998. In February 1998, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132 \"Employers\\' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits\" (FASB 132). This statement requires AIG to revise its disclosures about pension and other postretirement benefit plans and does not change the measurement or recognition of these plans. Also, FASB 132 requires additional information on changes in the benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets. FASB 132 was effective for the year ended December 31, 1998. In June 1998, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 \"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\" (FASB 133). This statement requires AIG to recognize all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheet measuring these derivatives at fair value. The recognition of the change in the fair value of a derivative depends on a number of factors, including the intended use of the derivative. Currently, AIGTG and AIGFP present, in all material respects, the changes in fair value of their derivative transactions as a component of AIG\\'s operating income. AIG is evaluating the impact of FASB 133 with respect to derivative transactions entered into by other AIG operations. AIG believes that the impact of FASB 133 on its results of operations, financial condition or liquidity will not be significant. FASB 133 is effective for the year commencing January 1, 2001.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\n(a) Principles of Consolidation: On January 1, 1999 (the merger date), SunAmerica Inc., a Maryland corporation, merged with and into AIG. AIG issued 187.5 million shares of its common stock in exchange for all the outstanding common stock and Class B stock of SunAmerica Inc., based on an exchange ratio of 0.855 shares of AIG common stock for each share of SunAmerica Inc. stock. A newly formed Delaware company, SunAmerica Inc. (SunAmerica) holds substantially all of the assets previously held by the Maryland corporation. The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and the accompanying financial statements for 1998 and prior years have been restated to combine SunAmerica Inc.\\'s financial statements for its fiscal years ended September 30 with AIG\\'s December 31 financial statements. The following is a reconciliation of the individual company results to the combined results for the twelve month periods during 1998 and 1997:\\nThe financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 1999, included in the AIG Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q reflected the operations of SunAmerica on a pooling of interests basis and the change of its fiscal year from September 30 to December 31. For the period October 1, 1998 through December 31, 1998, SunAmerica Inc.\\'s revenues were $318 million, operating income was $52 million and net income was $29 million; dividends distributed were $33 million. Thus, capital funds at December 31, 1999 reflect the net decrease in SunAmerica Inc.\\'s retained earnings of $4 million and the decline of $94 million in accumulated other comprehensive income. AIG subsidiaries write property, casualty, marine, life and financial lines insurance in approximately 130 countries and jurisdictions. Certain of AIG\\'s foreign subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements report on a fiscal year ending November 30. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Commencing with the third quarter 1998, Transatlantic and 21st Century were consolidated into AIG\\'s financial statements as AIG became the majority shareholder of these entities. (b) Basis of Presentation: The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.'),\n",

Acquisition costs represent those costs, including commissions, that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new business. These costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums written are earned. Investment income is not anticipated in the deferral of acquisition costs. (See Note 4.)\\nLosses and loss expenses are charged to income as incurred. The reserve for losses and loss expenses represents the accumulation of estimates for reported losses and includes provisions for losses incurred but not reported. The methods of determining such estimates and establishing resulting reserves, including amounts relating to reserves for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance, are continually reviewed and updated. Adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in income currently. AIG discounts certain of its loss reserves which are primarily related to certain workers' compensation claims. (See Note 6.)\\nLife Insurance Operations: AIG's life insurance subsidiaries offer a wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment products. Traditional products consist of individual and group life, annuity, endowment and accident and health policies. Financial and investment products consist of single premium annuity, variable annuities, guaranteed investment contracts, universal life and pensions. Premiums for traditional life insurance products and life contingent annuities, excluding accident and health products, are recognized as revenues when due. Estimates for premiums due but not yet collected are accrued. Benefits and expenses are provided against such revenues to recognize profits over the estimated life of the policies. Revenues for universal life and investment-type products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, administration and surrenders during the period. Expenses include interest credited to policy account balances and benefit payments made in excess of policy account balances. Accident and health products are accounted for in a manner similar to general insurance products described above. Investment income reflects certain amounts of realized capital gains where the gains are deemed to be an inherent element in pricing certain life products in some foreign countries. Policy acquisition costs for traditional life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period of the policy. Deferred policy acquisition costs and policy initiation costs related to universal life and investment-type products are amortized in relation to expected gross profits over the life of the policies.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\\nlife and investment-type products are deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts. Estimated gross profits are composed of net interest income, net realized investment gains and losses, variable annuity fees, surrender charges and direct administrative expenses. As debt and equity securities available for sale are carried at aggregate fair value, an adjustment is made to deferred policy acquisition costs equal to the change in amortization that would have been recorded if such securities had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields. The change in this adjustment, net of tax, is included with the change in net unrealized gains/losses on debt and equity securities available for sale that is credited or charged directly to comprehensive income. Deferred policy acquisition costs have been increased by $130 million at December 31, 1999 and reduced by $145 million at December 31, 1998 for this adjustment. (See Note 4.)\\nThe liabilities for future policy benefits and policyholders' contract deposits are established using assumptions described in Note 6. Financial Services Operations: AIG participates in the derivatives dealer market conducting, primarily as principal, an interest rate, currency, equity and credit derivative products business. AIG also enters into structured transactions including long-dated forward foreign exchange contracts, option transactions, liquidity facilities and investment agreements and invests in a diversified portfolio of securities. AIG engages in market making and trading activities, as principal, in foreign exchange, interest rates and precious and base metals. AIG owns inventories in the commodities in which it trades and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the use of swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts. AIG, as lessor, leases flight equipment principally under operating leases. Accordingly, income is reported over the life of the lease as rentals become receivable under the provisions of the lease or, in the case of leases with varying payments, under the straight-line method over the noncancelable term of the lease. In certain cases, leases provide for additional amounts contingent on usage. AIG is also a remarketer of flight equipment for its own account and for airlines and financial institutions. AIG's revenues from such operations consist of net gains on sales of flight equipment and commissions. Asset Management Operations: AIG's asset management operations offer a wide variety of investment vehicles and services, including variable annuities, mutual funds and investment asset management. Such products and services are offered to individuals and institutions both domestically and internationally. The fees generated with respect to asset management operations are recognized as revenues when earned. Costs incurred in the sale of variable annuities and mutual funds are deferred and subsequently amortized. With respect to variable annuities, acquisition costs are amortized in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the variable annuity contracts. With respect to the sale of mutual funds, acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the funds obtained. (c) Non-cash Transaction: In July 1998, 224,950 shares of 21st Century's Series A preferred stock were converted into 19,584,368 shares of 21st Century's common stock. (d) Investments in Fixed Maturities and Equity Securities: Bonds and preferred stocks held to maturity, both of which are principally owned by the insurance subsidiaries, are carried at amortized cost where AIG has the ability and positive intent to hold these securities until maturity. Where AIG may not have the positive intent to hold these securities until maturity, those bonds are considered to be available for sale and carried at current market values. Interest income with respect to fixed maturity securities is accrued currently. Included in the bonds available for sale are collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). Premiums and discounts arising from the purchase of CMOs are treated as yield adjustments over their estimated lives. Bond trading securities are carried at current market values, as it is AIG's intention to sell these securities in the near term. Common and non-redeemable preferred stocks are carried at current market values. Dividend income is generally recognized when receivable. Unrealized gains and losses from investments in equity securities and fixed maturities available for sale are reflected as a separate component of comprehensive income, net of deferred income taxes in capital funds currently. Unrealized gains and losses from investments in trading securities are reflected in income currently. Realized capital gains and losses are determined principally by specific identification. Where declines in values of securities below cost or amortized cost are considered to be other than temporary, a charge is reflected in income for the difference between cost or amortized cost and estimated net realizable value. (e) Mortgage Loans on Real Estate, Policy and Collateral Loans-net: Mortgage loans on real estate, policy loans and collateral loans are carried at unpaid principal balances. Interest income on such loans is accrued currently. Impairment of mortgage loans on real estate and collateral loans is generally measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate subject to the fair value of underlying collateral. Interest income on such loans is recognized as cash is received. There is no allowance for policy loans, as these loans serve to reduce the death benefit paid when the death claim is made and the balances are effectively collateralized by the cash surrender value of the policy. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes to Financial Statements (CONTINUED)\\n1.

Under the provisions of most leases for certain airframe and engine overhauls, the lessee is reimbursed for costs incurred up to but not exceeding contingent rentals paid to AIG by the lessee. AIG provides a charge to income for such reimbursements based upon the expected reimbursements during the life of the lease. Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line basis to a residual value of approximately 15 percent over the estimated useful lives of the related assets but not exceeding 25 years. AIG monitors the global aircraft market and the values of various types and models of aircraft within that market relative to the values of its own fleet. If events or circumstances were such that the carrying amount of AIG's aircraft might be impaired, AIG would determine if such impairment existed and recognize such impairment. This caption also includes deposits for aircraft to be purchased. At the time the assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the related accounts and the difference, net of proceeds, is recorded as a gain or loss. (g) Securities Available for Sale, at market value: These securities are held to meet long term investment objectives and are accounted for as available for sale, carried at current market values and recorded on a trade date basis. Unrealized gains and losses from valuing these securities and any related hedges are reflected in capital funds currently, net of any related deferred income taxes. When the underlying security is sold, the realized gain or loss resulting from the hedging derivative transaction is recognized in income in that same period as the realized gain or loss of the hedged security.

(i) Spot Commodities, at market value: Spot commodities are carried at current market values and are recorded on a settlement date basis. The exposure to market risk may be reduced through the use of forwards, futures and option contracts. Unrealized gains and losses of both commodities and any derivative transactions are reflected in income currently. (j) Unrealized Gain and Unrealized Loss on Interest Rate and Currency Swaps, Options and Forward Transactions: Interest rate swaps, currency swaps, equity swaps, swaptions, options and forward transactions are accounted for as contractual commitments recorded on a trade date basis and are carried at current market values or estimated fair values when market values are not available. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in income currently. Estimated fair values are based on the use of valuation models that utilize, among other things, current interest, foreign exchange and volatility rates. These valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows of these transactions and may include reserves for market risk as deemed appropriate. The portfolio's discounted cash flows are evaluated with reference to current market conditions, maturities within the portfolio and other relevant factors. Based upon this evaluation, it is determined what offsetting transactions, if any, are necessary to reduce the market risk of the portfolio. AIG manages its market risk with a variety of transactions, including swaps, trading securities, futures and forward contracts and other transactions as appropriate. Because of the limited liquidity of some of these instruments, the recorded values of these transactions may be different than the values that might be realized if AIG were to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes that such differences are not significant to the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Such differences would be immediately recognized when the transactions are sold or closed out prior to maturity. (k) Trading Assets and Trading Liabilities: Trading assets and trading liabilities include option premiums paid and received and receivables from and payables to counterparties which relate to unrealized gains and losses on futures, forwards and options and balances due from and due to clearing brokers and exchanges. Futures, forwards and options purchased and written are accounted for as contractual commitments on a trade date basis and are carried at fair values. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in income currently. The fair values of futures contracts are based on closing exchange quotations. Commodity forward transactions are carried at fair values derived from dealer quotations and underlying commodity exchange quotations. For long dated forward transactions, where there are no dealer or exchange quotations, fair values are derived using internally developed valuation methodologies based on available market information. Options are carried at fair values based on the use of valuation models that utilize, among other things, current interest or commodity rates and foreign exchange and volatility rates, as applicable. (l) Securities Purchased (Sold) Under Agreements to Resell (Repurchase), at contract value: Purchases of securities under agreements to resell and sales of securities under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized lending transactions and are recorded at their contracted resale or repurchase amounts, plus accrued interest. Generally, it is AIG's policy to take possession of or obtain a security interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell. AIG minimizes the credit risk that counterparties to transactions might be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations by monitoring customer credit exposure and collateral value and generally requiring additional collateral to be deposited with AIG when deemed necessary. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc.\"),\n",

It also includes funds held under reinsurance treaties. Amounts related to paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses with respect to these reinsurance agreements are substantially collateralized. (o) Investments in Partially-Owned Companies: The equity method of accounting is used for AIG\\'s investment in companies in which AIG\\'s ownership interest approximates twenty but is not greater than fifty percent (minority-owned companies). Equity in income of minority-owned insurance operations is presented separately in the consolidated statement of income. Equity in net income of other unconsolidated companies is principally included in other income (deductions)--net. At December 31, 1999, AIG\\'s significant investments in partially-owned companies included its 24.4 percent interest in IPC Holdings, Ltd. This balance sheet caption also includes investments in less significant partially-owned companies and in certain minor majority-owned subsidiaries. The amounts of dividends received from unconsolidated subsidiaries owned less than 50 percent were $13 million, $24 million and $30 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997 respectively. The undistributed earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries owned less than 50 percent was $82 million as of December 31, 1999. In 1999, AIG did not report equity in income of minority-owned insurance operations as a result of the consolidation of Transatlantic\\'s and SELIC Holdings, Ltd. operations into general insurance operating results. IPC Holdings, Ltd., the remaining operation included in equity in income of minority-owned insurance operations in previous periods is now reported as a component of other income (deductions) -- net. (p) Real Estate and Other Fixed Assets: The costs of buildings and furniture and equipment are depreciated principally on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (maximum of 40 years for buildings and 10 years for furniture and equipment). Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred; expenditures for betterments are capitalized and depreciated. From time to time, AIG assesses the carrying value of its real estate relative to the market values of real estate within the specific local area. At December 31, 1999, there were no impairments. (q) Separate and Variable Accounts: Separate and variable accounts represent funds for which investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to the policyholders. Each account has specific investment objectives, and the assets are carried at market value. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims which arise out of any other business of AIG. (r) Securities and Spot Commodities Sold but not yet Purchased, at market value: Securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased represent sales of securities and spot commodities not owned at the time of sale. The obligations arising from such transactions are recorded on a trade date basis and carried at the respective current market values or current commodity prices. (s) Preferred Shareholders\\' Equity in Subsidiary Companies: Preferred shareholders\\' equity in subsidiary companies relates to outstanding preferred stock of ILFC and certain subsidiaries of SunAmerica, both wholly owned subsidiaries of AIG. Dividends on such preferred stock are accounted for as interest expense and included as minority interest in the consolidated statement of income. (t) Translation of Foreign Currencies: Financial statement accounts expressed in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52 \"Foreign Currency Translation\" (FASB 52). Under FASB 52, functional currency assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars generally using current rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date of each respective subsidiary and the related translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of comprehensive income, net of any related taxes in capital funds. Functional currencies are generally the currencies of the local operating environment. Income statement accounts expressed in functional currencies are translated using average exchange rates. The adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign entities operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in income. Exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are also recorded in income currently. The exchange gain or loss with respect to utilization of foreign exchange hedging instruments is recorded as a component of comprehensive income. (u) Income Taxes: Deferred federal and foreign income taxes are provided for temporary differences for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in AIG\\'s financial statements or tax returns.

The computation of earnings per share for December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 was as follows:\\n(w) Accounting Standards: In June 1997, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130 \"Reporting Comprehensive Income\" (FASB 130) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 \"Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information\" (FASB 131). FASB 130 establishes standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements. FASB 130 was effective for AIG as of January 1, 1998. FASB 131 establishes standards for the way AIG is required to disclose information about its operating segments in its annual financial statements and selected information in its interim financial statements. FASB 131 establishes, where practicable, standards with respect to geographic areas, among other things. Certain descriptive information is also required. FASB 131 was effective for the year ended December 31, 1998. In February 1998, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132 \"Employers\\' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits\" (FASB 132). This statement requires AIG to revise its disclosures about pension and other postretirement benefit plans and does not change the measurement or recognition of these plans. Also, FASB 132 requires additional information on changes in the benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets. FASB 132 was effective for the year ended December 31, 1998. In June 1998, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 \"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\" (FASB 133). This statement requires AIG to recognize all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheet measuring these derivatives at fair value. The recognition of the change in the fair value of a derivative depends on a number of factors, including the intended use of the derivative. Currently, AIG Financial Products Corp. and its subsidiaries (AIGFP) and AIG Trading Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (AIGTG) present, in all material respects, the changes in fair value of their derivative transactions as a component of AIG\\'s operating income. AIG is evaluating the impact of FASB 133 with respect to derivative transactions entered into by other AIG operations. AIG believes that the impact of FASB 133 on its results of operations, financial condition or liquidity will not be significant. FASB 133 is effective for the year commencing January 1, 2001. In December 1997, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AcSEC) issued Statement of Position (SOP) 97-3, \"Accounting by Insurance and Other Enterprises for Insurance-Related Assessments.\" This statement provides guidance for the recording of a liability for insurance-related assessments. The statement requires that a liability be recognized in certain defined circumstances. This statement was effective for the year commencing January 1, 1999 and has been adopted herein. SOP 97-3 did not have a material impact on AIG\\'s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In October 1998, AcSEC issued SOP 98-7, \"Deposit Accounting: Accounting for Insurance and Reinsurance Contracts That Do Not Transfer Insurance Risk.\" This statement identifies several methods of deposit accounting and provides guidance on the application of each method. This statement classifies insurance and reinsurance contracts for which the deposit\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nmethod is appropriate as contracts that (i) transfer only significant timing risk, (ii) transfer only significant underwriting risk, (iii) transfer neither significant timing nor underwriting risk, and (iv) have an indeterminate risk. AIG believes that the impact of this statement on its results of operations, financial condition or liquidity will not be significant. This statement is effective for the year commencing January 1, 2000. Restatement of previously issued financial statements is not permitted.'),\n",

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs\\nThe following reflects the policy acquisition costs deferred for amortization against future income and the related amortization charged to income for general and life insurance operations, excluding certain amounts deferred and amortized in the same period:\\n5. Reinsurance\\nIn the ordinary course of business, AIG's general and life insurance companies cede reinsurance to other insurance companies in order to provide greater diversification of AIG's business and limit the potential for losses arising from large risks. General reinsurance is effected under reinsurance treaties and by negotiation on individual risks. Certain of these reinsurance arrangements consist of excess of loss contracts which protect AIG against losses over stipulated amounts. Ceded premiums are considered prepaid reinsurance premiums and are amortized into income over the contract period in proportion to the protection received. Amounts recoverable from general reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claims liabilities associated with the reinsurance and presented as a component of reinsurance assets. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\n5. Reinsurance (continued)\\nAIG life companies limit exposure to loss on any single life. For ordinary insurance, AIG retains a maximum of approximately one million dollars of coverage per individual life. There are smaller retentions for other lines of business. Life reinsurance is effected principally under yearly renewable term treaties. The premiums with respect to these treaties are considered prepaid reinsurance premiums and are amortized into income over the contract period in proportion to the protection provided. Amounts recoverable from life reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the assumptions used for the underlying policy benefits and are presented as a component of reinsurance assets. General insurance premiums written and earned were comprised of the following:\\nFor the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, reinsurance recoveries, which reduced loss and loss expenses incurred, amounted to $5.13 billion, $5.36 billion and $4.59 billion, respectively. Life insurance net premium income was comprised of the following:\\nLife insurance recoveries, which reduced death and other benefits, approximated $168 million, $176 million and $190 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997. AIG's reinsurance arrangements do not relieve AIG from its direct obligation to its insureds. Thus, a credit exposure exists with respect to both general and life reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations assumed under the reinsurance agreements. AIG holds substantial collateral as security under related reinsurance agreements in the form of funds, securities and/or letters of credit. A provision has been recorded for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance. AIG has been largely successful in prior recovery efforts. AIG evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers through an internal reinsurance security committee consisting of members of AIG's senior management. No single reinsurer is a material reinsurer to AIG nor is AIG's business substantially dependent upon any reinsurance contract. Life insurance ceded to other insurance companies was as follows:\\nLife insurance assumed represented 0.2 percent of gross life insurance in-force at December 31, 1999 and 0.3 percent at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively, and life insurance premium income assumed represented 0.3 percent, 0.3 percent and 0.2 percent of gross premium income for the periods ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

Short duration contract liabilities are primarily accident and health products. The liability for future life policy benefits has been established based upon the following assumptions:\\n(i) Interest rates (exclusive of immediate/terminal funding annuities), which vary by territory, year of issuance and products, range from 1.5 percent to 12.0 percent within the first 20 years. Interest rates on immediate/terminal funding annuities are at a maximum of 12.2 percent and grade to not greater than 7.5 percent.

(iv) Participating life business represented approximately 30 percent of the gross insurance in-force at December 31, 1999 and 46 percent of gross premium income in 1999. The amount of dividends to be paid is determined annually by the Boards of Directors. Anticipated dividends are considered as a planned contractual benefit in computing the value of future policy benefits and are provided ratably over the premium-paying period of the contracts. (d) The liability for policyholders' contract deposits has been established based on the following assumptions:\\n(i) Interest rates credited on deferred annuities, which vary by territory and year of issuance, range from 2.0 percent to 12.0 percent. Credited interest rate guarantees are generally for a period of one year. Withdrawal charges generally range from zero percent to 10.0 percent grading to zero over a period of zero to 10 years. (ii) Domestically, GICs have market value withdrawal provisions for any funds withdrawn other than benefit responsive payments. Interest rates credited generally range from 3.9 percent to 9.4 percent and maturities range from 1 to 30 years. Overseas, primarily in the United Kingdom, GIC type contracts are credited at rates ranging from 3.6 percent to 5.8 percent with guarantees generally being one year. Contracts in other foreign locations have interest rates, maturities and withdrawal charges based upon local economic and regulatory conditions. (iii) Interest rates on corporate life insurance products are guaranteed at 4.0 percent and the weighted average rate credited in 1999 was 6.7 percent. (iv) The universal life funds have credited interest rates of 4.5 percent to 7.0 percent and guarantees ranging from 3.5 percent to 5.5 percent depending on the year of issue. Additionally, universal life funds are subject to surrender charges that amount to 11.0 percent of the fund balance grading to zero over a period not longer than 20 years. (e) Certain products, which are short duration contracts, are subject to experience adjustments. These include group life and group medical products, credit life contracts, accident & health insurance contracts/riders attached to life policies and, to a limited extent, reinsurance agreements with other direct insurers. Ultimate premiums from these contracts are estimated and recognized as revenue and the unearned portions of the premiums are held as reserves.

An analysis of AIG's Medium Term Notes for the year ended December 31, 1999 was as follows:\\nThe interest rates on this debt range from 2.25 percent to 6.38 percent. To the extent deemed appropriate, AIG may enter into swap transactions to reduce its effective borrowing rates with respect to these notes.

The notes were offered at 12 percent of princi pal amount at stated maturity, bear no interest and are due August 15, 2004. The net proceeds to AIG from the issuance were $86 million. The notes are redeemable at any time in whole or in part at the option of AIG at 100 percent of their principal amount at stated maturity. The notes are also redeemable at the option of AIG or bearer notes may be redeemed at the option of the holder in the event of certain changes involving taxation in the United States at prices ranging from 58.66 percent currently, to 89.88 percent after August 15, 2003, of the principal amount at stated maturity together with accrued amortization of original issue discount from the preceding August 15. During 1999 and 1998, no notes were repurchased. At December 31, 1999, the notes outstanding after prior purchases had a face value of $189 million, an unamortized discount of $75 million and a net book value of $114 million. The amortization of the original issue discount was recorded as interest expense. (B) Italian Lire Bonds: In December, 1991, AIG issued unsecured bonds denominated in Italian Lire. The principal amount of 200 billion Italian Lire Bonds matures December 4, 2001 and accrues interest at a rate of 11.7 percent which is paid annually. These bonds are not redeemable prior to matu-\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes to Financial Statements (CONTINUED)\\n9.

Simultaneous with the issuance of this debt, AIG entered into a swap transaction which effectively converted AIG's net interest expense to a U.S. dollar liability of approximately 7.9 percent, which requires the payment of proceeds at maturity of approximately $159 million in exchange for 200 billion Italian Lire and interest thereon. (C) Notes and Debentures Issued by SunAmerica Inc.: As of December 31, 1999, Notes and Debentures issued by SunAmerica Inc. in aggregate principal amount of $432 million (net of amortized discount of $43 million) were outstanding with maturity dates from 2007 to 2097 at interest rates ranging from 5.60 percent to 9.95 percent. (ii) Term Notes Issued by ILFC: ILFC has issued unsecured obligations which may not be redeemed prior to maturity. As of December 31, 1999, notes in aggregate principal amount of $3.72 billion were outstanding with maturity dates from 2000 to 2004 and interest rates ranging from 5.50 percent to 8.88 percent. Term notes in the aggregate principal amount of $100 million are at floating interest rates and the remainder are at fixed rates. These notes provide for a single principal payment at maturity. At December 31, 1999, the maturity schedule for ILFC's Term Notes was as follows:\\nAt December 31, 1999, ILFC had $1.68 billion in aggregate principal amount of debt securities registered for issuance from time to time. In addition, ILFC established a Euro Medium Term Note program for $2.0 billion, under which $771 million in notes were sold through December 31, 1999. Also included in term notes are ILFC's borrowings under an Export Credit Facility. ILFC has an Export Credit Facility up to a maximum of $4.3 billion, for approximately 75 aircraft to be delivered from 1999 through 2001. ILFC has the right, but is not required, to use the facility to fund 85 percent of each aircraft's purchase price. This facility is guaranteed by various European Export Credit Agencies. The interest rate varies from 5.75 percent to 5.90 percent on the first 75 aircraft depending on the delivery date of the aircraft. Through December 31, 1999, ILFC borrowed $1.30 billion under this facility. Borrowings with respect to this facility are included in Notes and Bonds Payable in the accompanying table of borrowings.At December 31, 1999, the future minimum payments for ILFC's borrowings under the Export Credit Facility was as follows:\\nAIG does not guarantee any of the debt obligations of ILFC. (iii) Notes and Bonds Payable Issued by AIGFP: At December 31, 1999, AIGFP's bonds outstanding, the proceeds of which are invested in a segregated portfolio of securities available for sale, were as follows:\\nAIGFP is also obligated under various notes maturing from 2000 through 2026.

Capital Funds\\n(a) AIG parent depends on its subsidiaries for cash flow in the form of loans, advances and dividends. AIG\\'s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions on the amount of dividends which can be remitted to AIG parent. These restrictions vary by state. For example, unless permitted by the New York Superintendent of Insurance, general insurance companies domiciled in New York may not pay dividends to shareholders which in any twelve month period exceed the lesser of 10 percent of the company\\'s statutory policyholders\\' surplus or 100 percent of its \"adjusted net investment income\", as defined. Generally, less severe restrictions applicable to both general and life insurance companies exist in most of the other states in which AIG\\'s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled. Certain foreign jurisdictions have restrictions which generally cause only a temporary delay in the remittance of dividends. There are also various local restrictions limiting cash loans and advances to AIG by its subsidiaries. Largely as a result of the restrictions, approximately 65 percent of consolidated capital funds were restricted from immediate transfer to AIG parent at December 31, 1999. (b) At December 31, 1999, there were 6,000,000 shares of AIG\\'s $5 par value serial preferred stock authorized, issuable in series. (c) The activity for preferred stock issued by SunAmerica Inc. prior to the merger with AIG for the year ended December 31, 1999 and the two years ended September 30, 1998 was as follows:\\nOn November 1, 1995, SunAmerica Inc. issued 4,000,000 $3.10 Depositary Shares (the \"Series E Depositary Shares\"), each representing one-fiftieth of a share of Series E Mandatory Conversion Premium Dividend Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of $62 per share. On September 22, 1998, SunAmerica Inc. announced that it would redeem all of its Series E Depositary Shares. The redemption was completed on October 30, 1998 and resulted in the issuance of 11,250,709 shares of SunAmerica Inc. common stock and cash payment of all accrued and unpaid dividends through the redemption date. At September 30, 1996, SunAmerica Inc. had outstanding 486,800 shares of Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C (the \"Series C Preferred Shares\"), with a liquidation preference of $100 per share. On October 4, 1996, SunAmerica Inc. redeemed all of the Series C Preferred Shares for a cash payment equal to the total liquidation amount of $49 million plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date.

(b) Shares issued to AIG and subsidiaries as part of stock split effected as stock dividend and conversion of SunAmerica Inc. non-transferrable Class B stock to common stock. Common stock increased and retained earnings decreased $818 million in 1999, $949 million in 1998 and $633 million in 1997 as a result of common stock splits in the form of 25 percent, 50 percent and 50 percent common stock dividends paid July 30, 1999, July 31, 1998 and July 25, 1997, respectively. (e) On November 6, 1996, SunAmerica Inc. issued 11,500,000 8 1/2% Premium Equity Redemption Cumulative Security Units (the \"Units\") with a stated amount of $37.50 per Unit. Each Unit consisted of a stock purchase contract (the \"Contract\") and a United States Treasury Note (the \"Treasury Note\") having a principal amount equal to the stated amount and maturing on October 31, 1999. The holders of the Units received interest on the Treasury Notes payable by the United States Government at a rate of 7 1/2% per annum and Contract fees payable at a rate of 1% per annum (both, the \"Unit Payments\") based upon the stated amount. The Contract obligated SunAmerica Inc. to deliver on October 31, 1999 to the holder of each Unit one and one-half shares of common stock of SunAmerica Inc., subject to adjustment under certain defined circumstances, and obligated the holder of the Unit to pay to SunAmerica Inc. $37.50 per Unit. The Treasury Notes were held by a collateral agent to secure payment to SunAmerica Inc. as required under the Contract, but could be redeemed by the holders of the Units under certain defined circumstances. SunAmerica Inc. redeemed all of its Units on December 6, 1998.

In addition, AIG guarantees various obligations of certain subsidiaries. (a) Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend subject to certain conditions. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses and typically require payment of a fee. These commitments approximated $150 million and $92 million for December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. AIG uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. AIG evaluates each counterparty's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by AIG upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. (b) AIG and certain of its subsidiaries become parties to financial instruments with market risk resulting from both dealer and end user activities and to reduce currency, interest rate, equity and commodity exposures. To the extent those instruments are carried at their estimated fair value, the elements of currency, interest rate, equity and commodity risks are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. In addition, these instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk not explicitly recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. Collateral is required, at the discretion of AIG, on certain transactions based on the creditworthiness of the counterparty. (c) AIGFP becomes a party to off-balance sheet financial instruments in the normal course of its business and to reduce its currency, interest rate and equity exposures. Interest rate, currency and equity risks related to such instruments are reflected in the consolidated financial statements to the extent these instruments are carried at a market or a fair value, whichever is appropriate. Because of limited liquidity of certain of these instruments, the recorded estimated fair values of such instruments may be different than the values that might be realized if AIGFP were to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIGFP, in the ordinary course of its operations and as principal, structures derivative transactions to meet the needs of investors who may be seeking to hedge certain aspects of such investors' operations. AIGFP may also enter into derivative transactions for its own account. Such derivative\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes to Financial Statements (CONTINUED)\\n12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities (continued)\\ntransactions include interest rate, currency and equity swaps, swaptions and forward commitments. Interest rate swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. AIGFP typically becomes a principal in the exchange of interest payments between the parties and, therefore, may be exposed to loss, if counterparties default. Currency and equity swaps are similar to interest rate swaps, but may involve the exchange of principal amounts at the beginning and end of the transaction. Swaptions are options where the holder has the right but not the obligation to enter into a swap transaction or cancel an existing swap transaction. At December 31, 1999, the notional principal amount of the sum of the swap pays and receives approximated $413.4 billion, primarily related to interest rate swaps of approximately $281.7 billion. The following tables provide the contractual and notional amounts of derivatives transactions of AIGFP and AIGTG at December 31, 1999. The notional amounts used to express the extent of involvement in swap transactions represent a standard of measurement of the volume of swaps business of AIGFP and AIGTG. Notional amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and it may not necessarily be recorded on the balance sheet. Notional amounts represent those amounts used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received, except for certain contracts such as currency swaps. The timing and the amount of cash flows relating to AIGFP's and AIGTG's foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures and options contracts are determined by each of the respective contractual agreements. The following table presents AIGFP's derivatives portfolio by maturity and type of derivative at December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998:\\nFutures and forward contracts are contracts for delivery of foreign currencies or financial indices in which the seller/purchaser agrees to make/take delivery at a specified future date of a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield. Risks arise as a result of movements in current market prices from contracted prices and the potential inability of counterparties to meet their obligations under the contracts. At December 31, 1999, the contractual amount of AIGFP's futures and forward contracts approximated $28.5 billion. The following table presents AIGFP's futures and forward contracts portfolio by maturity and type of derivative at December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998:\\nThese instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk not explicitly recognized in the consolidated financial statements. AIGFP utilizes various credit enhancements, including collateral, credit triggers and credit derivatives to reduce the credit exposure relating to these off-balance sheet financial instruments. AIGFP requires credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties and the transaction's size and maturity. In addition, AIGFP's derivative transactions are generally documented under ISDA Master Agreements. Such agreements provide for legally enforceable set-off and close out netting of exposures to specific counterparties. Under such agreements, in connection with an early termination of a transaction, AIGFP is permitted to set off its receivables from a counterparty against its payables to the same counterparty arising out of all included transactions. As a result, the net replacement value represents the net sum of estimated positive fair values after the application of such strategies, agreements and collateral held. Prior to the application of the aforementioned credit enhancements, the gross exposure to credit risk with respect to these derivative instruments was $16.90 billion at December 31, 1999. Subsequent to the application of such\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\n12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities (continued)\\ncredit enhancements, the net exposure to credit risk or the net replacement value of all interest rate, currency, and equity swaps, swaptions and forward commitments at December 31, 1999, approximated $7.53 billion. The net replacement value for futures and forward contracts at December 31, 1999, approximated $5 million. The net replacement value most closely represents the net credit risk to AIGFP or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss. AIGFP independently evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties, taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized statistical rating organizations. In addition, AIGFP's credit approval process involves pre-set counterparty, country and industry credit exposure limits and, for particularly credit intensive transactions, obtaining approval from AIG's Credit Risk Committee. The average credit rating of AIGFP's counterparties as a whole (as measured by AIGFP) is equivalent to AA. The maximum potential loss will increase or decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions. AIGFP determines counterparty credit quality by reference to ratings from independent rating agencies or internal analysis. At December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998, the counterparty credit quality by derivative product with respect to the net replacement value of AIGFP's derivatives portfolio was as follows:\\nAt December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998, the counterparty breakdown by industry with respect to the net replacement value of AIGFP's derivatives portfolio was as follows:\\nSecurities sold, but not yet purchased represent obligations of AIGFP to deliver specified securities at their contracted prices, and thereby create a liability to repurchase the securities in the market at prevailing prices. AIGFP monitors and controls its risk exposure on a daily basis through financial, credit and legal reporting systems and, accordingly, believes that it has in place effective procedures for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which it is subject. Management is not aware of any potential counterparty defaults. Commissions, transaction and other fees for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 from AIGFP's operations were $737 million, $550 million and $452 million, respectively. (d) AIGTG becomes a party to off-balance sheet financial instruments in the normal course of its business and to reduce its currency, interest rate and commodity exposures. The following tables provide the contractual and notional amounts of AIGTG's derivatives portfolio at December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998. In addition, the estimated positive fair\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes to Financial Statements (CONTINUED)\\n12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities (continued)\\nvalues associated with the derivatives portfolio are also provided and include a maturity profile for the December 31, 1999 balances based upon the expected timing of the future cash flows. Futures and forward contracts are contracts for delivery of foreign currencies, commodities or financial indices in which the seller/purchaser agrees to make/take delivery at a specified future date of a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield. Risks arise as a result of movements in current market prices from contracted prices and the potential inability of counterparties to meet their obligations under the contracts. Options are contracts that allow the holder of the option to purchase or sell the underlying commodity, currency or index at a specified price and within, or at, a specified period of time. Risks arise as a result of movements in current market prices from contracted prices, and the potential inability of the counterparties to meet their obligations under the contracts. As a writer of options, AIGTG generally receives an option premium and then manages the risk of any unfavorable change in the value of the underlying commodity, currency or index. At December 31, 1999, the contractual amount of AIGTG's futures, forward and option contracts approximated $409.9 billion. The gross replacement values presented represent the sum of the estimated positive fair values of all of AIGTG's derivatives contracts at December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998. These values do not represent the credit risk to AIGTG. Net replacement values presented represent the net sum of estimated positive fair values after the application of legally enforceable master closeout netting agreements and collateral held. The net replacement values most closely represent the net credit risk to AIGTG or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss within a product category. At December 31, 1999, the net replacement value of AIGTG's futures, forward and option contracts and interest rate and currency swaps approximated $3.1 billion. The following tables present AIGTG's derivatives portfolio and the associated credit exposure, if applicable, by maturity and type of derivative at December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998:\\n(a) Sold options obligate AIGTG to buy or sell the underlying item if the option purchaser chooses to exercise. The amounts do not represent credit exposure. (b) The net replacement values with respect to exchange traded futures and options, forward contracts and purchased over the counter options are presented as a component of trading assets in the accompanying balance sheet.

At December 31, 1998, AIGTG did not have a significant concentration of credit risk from either an individual counterparty or group of counterparties. Commissions, transaction and other fees for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 from AIGTG\\'s operations were $227 million, $374 million and $562 million, respectively. AIG has issued unconditional guarantees with respect to the prompt payment, when due, of all present and future obligations and liabilities of AIGFP and AIGTG arising from transactions entered into by AIGFP and AIGTG. (e) As a component of its asset and liability management strategy, SunAmerica utilizes swap agreements to match more closely the cash flows of its assets to the cash flows of its liabilities. SunAmerica uses these swap agreements to hedge against the risk of interest rate changes. At December 31, 1999, SunAmerica\\'s swap agreements had an aggregate notional principal amount of $2.01 billion. These agreements mature in various years through 2010. For investment purposes, SunAmerica has entered into various total return agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $576 million (the \"notional amount\") at December 31, 1999. The total return agreements effectively exchange a fixed rate of interest (the \"payment amount\") on the notional amount for the coupon income plus or minus the increase or decrease in the fair value of specified non-investment grade bonds (the \"bonds\"). SunAmerica is exposed to potential loss with respect to credit risk on the underlying non-investment grade bonds and fair value risk resulting from the payment amount and any depreciation in the aggregate fair value of the bonds below the notional amount. SunAmerica is also exposed to potential credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the investment grade rated counterparty with respect to any increase in the aggregate market value of the bonds above the notional amount. However, nonperformance is not anticipated and, therefore, no collateral is held or pledged.'),\n",

AIG does not believe that such litigation will have a material effect on its operating results and financial condition. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes to Financial Statements (CONTINUED)\\n12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities (continued)\\nAIG continues to receive claims asserting injuries from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites (hereinafter collectively referred to as environmental claims) and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a difficult process, as these claims, which emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years, cannot be estimated by conventional reserving techniques. Asbestos and environmental claims development is affected by factors such as inconsistent court resolutions, the broadening of the intent of policies and scope of coverage and increasing number of new claims. AIG and other industry members have and will continue to litigate the broadening judicial interpretation of policy coverage and the liability issues. If the courts continue in the future to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage, as they have in the past, additional liabilities would emerge for amounts in excess of reserves held. This emergence cannot now be reasonably estimated, but could have a material impact on AIG's future operating results. The reserves carried for these claims as at December 31, 1999 ($2.61 billion gross; $891 million net) are believed to be adequate as these reserves are based on known facts and current law. A summary of reserve activity, including estimates for applicable incurred but not reported losses and loss expenses, relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined at December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 follows. The 1999 and 1998 reserve activity includes Transatlantic. (h) Risk Based Capital (RBC) is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. Thus, inadequately capitalized general and life insurance companies may be identified. The RBC formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. Higher factors are applied to more risky items and lower factors are applied to less risky items. Thus, the target level of statutory surplus varies not only as a result of the insurer's size, but also on the risk profile of the insurer's operations. The RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control. The statutory surplus of each of AIG's domestic general and life insurance subsidiaries exceeded their RBC standards by considerable margins as of December 31, 1999. To the extent that any of AIG's insurance entities would fall below prescribed levels of surplus, it would be AIG's intention to infuse necessary capital to support that entity. 13.\"),\n",

These financial instruments may or may not be recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. In the measurement of the fair value of certain of the financial instruments, quoted market prices were not available and other valuation techniques were utilized. These derived fair value estimates are significantly affected by the assumptions used. FASB 107 excludes certain financial instruments, including those related to insurance contracts. The following methods and assumptions were used by AIG in estimating the fair value of the financial instruments presented:\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nCash and short-term investments: The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for these instruments approximate fair values. Fixed maturity securities: Fair values for fixed maturity securities carried at amortized cost or at market value were generally based upon quoted market prices. For certain fixed maturity securities for which market prices were not readily available, fair values were estimated using values obtained from independent pricing services. No other fair valuation techniques were applied to these securities as AIG believes it would have to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived. Equity securities: Fair values for equity securities were based upon quoted market prices. Mortgage loans on real estate, policy and collateral loans: Where practical, the fair values of loans on real estate and collateral loans were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based upon AIG\\'s current incremental lending rates for similar type loans. The fair values of the policy loans were not calculated as AIG believes it would have to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived. Trading assets and trading liabilities: Fair values for trading assets and trading liabilities approximate the carrying values presented in the consolidated balance sheet. Securities available for sale: Fair values for securities available for sale and related hedges were based on quoted market prices. For securities and related hedges for which market prices were not readily available, fair values were estimated using quoted market prices of comparable investments. Trading securities: Fair values for trading securities were based on current market value where available. For securities for which market values were not readily available, fair values were estimated using quoted market prices of comparable investments. Spot commodities: Fair values for spot commodities were based on current market prices. Unrealized gains and losses on interest rate and currency swaps, options and forward transactions: Fair values for swaps, options and forward transactions were based on the use of valuation models that utilize, among other things, current interest, foreign exchange and volatility rates, as applicable. Securities purchased (sold) under agreements to resell (repurchase), at contract value: As these securities (obligations) are short-term in nature, the contract values approximate fair values. Other invested assets: For assets for which market prices were not readily available, fair valuation techniques were not applied as AIG believes it would have to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived. Policyholders\\' contract deposits: Fair values of policyholder contract deposits were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based upon interest rates currently being offered for similar contracts with maturities consistent with those remaining for the contracts being valued. GIAs: Fair values of AIG\\'s obligations under investment type agreements were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based on interest rates currently being offered for similar agreements with maturities consistent with those remaining for the agreements being valued. Additionally, AIG follows a policy of minimizing interest rate risks associated with GIAs by entering into swap transactions. Securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased: The carrying amounts for the financial instruments approximate fair values. Fair values for spot commodities sold short were based on current market prices. Trust deposits and deposits due to banks and other depositors: To the extent certain amounts are not demand deposits or certificates of deposit which mature in more than one year, fair values were not calculated as AIG believes it would have to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived. Commercial paper: The carrying amount of AIG\\'s commercial paper borrowings approximates fair value. Notes, bonds, loans and mortgages payable: Where practical, the fair values of these obligations were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based upon AIG\\'s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowings with maturities consistent with those remaining for the debt being valued. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes to Financial Statements (CONTINUED)\\n13.

The unrecognized fair values of these instruments represent fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the current agreements and the counterparties\\' credit standings.

Both the 1991 Plan, and the options with respect to 316,087 shares granted thereunder on December 19, 1991, were approved by shareholders at the 1992 Annual Meeting. An amendment to the 1991 Plan, approved by shareholders at the 1997 Annual Meeting, increased the aggregate number of shares available for grant to 22,148,437 shares to assure that adequate shares are available for grant during the remaining term of the 1991 Plan. A second amendment to the 1991 Plan limits the maximum number of shares as to which stock options may be granted to any employee in any one year to 253,125 shares. At December 31, 1999, 9,499,167 shares were reserved for future grants under the amended 1991 Plan. As of March 18, 1992, no further options could be granted under the 1987 employee stock option plan (the 1987 Plan), but outstanding options granted under the 1987 Plan continue in force until exercise or expiration. At December 31, 1999, there were 11,654,856 shares reserved for issuance under these plans. During 1999, AIG granted options with respect to 383,000 shares which become exercisable on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant and expire 10 years from the date of grant. These options do not qualify for Incentive Stock Option Treatment under the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ISO Treatment). The agreements with respect to all other options granted under these plans provide that 25 percent of the options granted become exercisable on the anniversary of the date of grant in each of the four years following that grant and expire 10 years from the date of the grant.

Information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 1999, is summarized as follows:\\nThe fair values of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 were $71 million, $28 million and $29 million, respectively. The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions were used for grants in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively: dividend yields of 0.20 percent, 0.24 percent and 0.30 percent; expected volatilities of 25.0 percent, 22.0 percent and 20.0 percent; risk-free interest rates of 5.33 percent, 4.73 percent and 6.03 percent and expected terms of 7 years. Using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model applicable to SunAmerica Inc. for 1998 and 1997, the fair values of stock options granted by SunAmerica Inc. for such years were $49 million and $32 million, respectively. (ii) Employee Stock Purchase Plan: AIG's 1984 employee stock purchase plan was adopted at its 1984 shareholders' meeting and became effective as of July 1, 1984. Eligible employees could receive privileges to purchase up to an aggregate of 5,537,108 shares of AIG common stock, at a price equal to 85 percent of the fair market value on the date of grant of the purchase privilege. Purchase privileges were granted annually and were limited to the number of whole shares that could be purchased by an amount equal to 5 percent of an employee's annual salary or $5,500, whichever was less. AIG's 1996 employee stock purchase plan was adopted at its 1996 shareholders' meeting and became effective as of July 1, 1996, replacing the 1984 plan. Eligible employees may receive privileges to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,812,500 shares of AIG common stock, at a price equal to 85 percent of the fair market value on the date of the grant of the purchase privilege. Purchase privileges are granted annually and are limited to the number of whole shares that can be purchased by an\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\namount equal to 5 percent of an employee's annual salary or $5,500, whichever is less. Beginning with the January 1, 1998 subscription, the maximum allowable purchase limitation increased to 10 percent of an employee's annual salary or $10,000 per year, whichever is less, and the eligibility requirement was reduced from two years to one year. In all other respects, the 1996 plan is identical to the 1984 plan. There were 130,010 shares issued under the 1984 plan at a weighted average price of $28.14 for the year ended December 31, 1997. There were 595,286 shares, 425,523 shares and 275,783 shares issued under the 1996 plan at weighted average prices of $57.36, $43.11 and $30.81 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The excess or deficit of the proceeds over the par value or cost of the common stock issued under these plans was credited or charged to additional paid-in capital. As of December 31, 1999, there were 495,827 shares of common stock subscribed to at a weighted average price of $77.49 per share pursuant to grants of privileges under the 1996 plan. There were 1,020,078 shares available for the grant of future purchase privileges under the 1996 plan at December 31, 1999. The fair values of purchase privileges granted during the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 were $13 million, $10 million and $4 million, respectively. The weighted average fair values per share of those purchase rights granted in 1999, 1998 and 1997 were $21.06, $15.46 and $10.68, respectively. The fair value of each purchase right is estimated on the date of the subscription using the Black-Scholes model.

Employee Benefits\\n(a) Employees of AIG, its subsidiaries and certain affiliated companies, including employees in foreign countries, are generally covered under various funded and insured pension plans. Eligibility for participation in the various plans is based on either completion of a specified period of continuous service or date of hire, subject to age limitation. AIG\\'s U.S. retirement plan is a qualified, noncontributory, defined benefit plan. All qualified employees, other than those of SunAmerica and 21st Century, who have attained age 21 and completed twelve months of continuous service are eligible to participate in this plan. An employee with 5 or more years of service is entitled to pension benefits beginning at normal retirement at age 65. Benefits are based upon a percentage of average final compensation multiplied by years of credited service limited to 44 years of credited service. The average final compensation is subject to certain limitations. Annual funding requirements are determined based on the \"projected unit credit\" cost method which attributes a pro rata portion of the total projected benefit payable at normal retirement to each year of credited service. AIG has adopted a Supplemental Executive Retirement Program (Supplemental Plan) to provide additional retirement benefits to designated executives and key employees. Under the Supplemental Plan, the annual benefit, not to exceed 60 percent of average final compensation, accrues at a percentage of average final pay multiplied for each year of credited service reduced by any benefits from the current and any predecessor retirement plans, Social Security, if any, and from any qualified pension plan of prior employers. The Supplemental Plan also provides a benefit equal to the reduction in benefits payable under the AIG retirement plan as a result of Federal limitations on benefits payable thereunder. Currently, the Supplemental Plan is unfunded. Eligibility for participation in the various non-U.S. retirement plans is either based on completion of a specified period of continuous service or date of hire, subject to age limitation. Where non-U.S. retirement plans are defined benefit plans, they are generally based on the employees\\' years of credited service and average compensation in the years preceding retirement. In addition to AIG\\'s defined benefit pension plan, AIG and its subsidiaries provide a postretirement benefit program for medical care and life insurance, domestically and in certain foreign countries. Eligibility in the various plans is generally based upon completion of a specified period of eligible service and reaching a specified age. Benefits vary by geographic location. AIG\\'s U.S. postretirement medical and life insurance benefits are based upon the employee electing immediate retirement and having a minimum of ten years of service. Retirees and their dependents who were age 65 by May 1, 1989 participate in the medical plan at no cost. Employees who retired after May 1, 1989 and on or prior to January 1, 1993 pay the active employee premium if under age 65 and 50 percent of the active employee premium if over age 65. Retiree contributions are subject to adjustment annually. Other cost sharing features of the medical plan include deductibles, coinsurance and Medicare coordination and a lifetime maximum benefit of $1.5 million. The lifetime maximum benefit of the medical plan was increased to $2.0 million effective January 1, 2000. The maximum life insurance benefit prior to age 70 is $32,500, with a maximum of $25,000 thereafter. Effective January 1, 1993, both plans\\' provisions were amended. Employees who retire after January 1, 1993 are required to pay the actual cost of the medical benefits premium reduced by a credit which is based upon age and years of service at retirement. The life insurance benefit varies by age at retirement from $5,000 for retirement at ages 55 through 59; $10,000 for retirement at ages 60 through 64 and $15,000 for retirement at ages 65 and over.

These segments and their respective operations are as follows:\\nGeneral Insurance - AIG's general insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance. DBG writes substantially all classes of business insurance accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers. This provides DBG the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to submit business to DBG without the traditional agent-company contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no authority to commit DBG to accept a risk. Transatlantic's domestic operations are included in this group. AIG's Foreign General insurance group accepts risks primarily underwritten through AIU, a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned agencies and insurance entities. The Foreign General insurance group also includes business written by AIG's foreign-based insurance subsidiaries for their own accounts. The Foreign General group uses various marketing methods to write both business and personal lines insurance with certain refinements for local laws, customs and needs. AIU operates in over 70 countries in Asia, the Pacific Rim, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America. Transatlantic's foreign operations are included in this group. Life Insurance - AIG's life insurance subsidiaries offer a wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment products. Traditional products consist of individual and group life, annuity, endowment and accident and health policies. Financial and investment products consist of single premium annuity, variable annuities, guaranteed investment contracts, universal life and pensions. AIG's three principal overseas life operations are ALICO, AIA and Nan Shan. ALICO is incorporated in Delaware and all of its business is written outside of the United States. ALICO has operations either directly or through subsidiaries in approximately 50 countries located in Europe, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and the Far East, with Japan being the largest territory. AIA operates primarily in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. Nan Shan operates in Taiwan. AIG's domestic life operations are comprised of two separate operations, AIG's domestic life companies and the life insurance subsidiaries of SunAmerica.\"),\n",

AIGFP structures financial transactions, including long-dated interest rate and currency swaps and structured borrowings through notes, bonds and guaranteed investment agreements. AIGTG engages in various commodities trading, foreign exchange trading, interest rate swaps and market making activities. Asset Management - AIG's asset management operations offer a wide variety of investment vehicles and services, including variable annuities, mutual funds and investment asset management. Such products and services are offered to individuals and institutions both domestically and internationally. AIG's three principal asset management operations are SAAMCo, Global Investment and Cap Partners.

The following table shows identifiable assets, revenues and income derived from operations in the United States and Canada and from operations in other countries for the year ended December 31, 2000. (See also Note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nGeneral Insurance Operations\\nAIG\\'s general insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance. One or more of these companies is licensed to write substantially all of these lines in all states of the United States and in approximately 70 foreign countries. Domestic general insurance operations are comprised of the Domestic Brokerage Group, which includes the domestic operations of Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (\"Transatlantic\") and HSB, Personal Lines, including 21st Century Insurance Group (21st Century), and Mortgage Guaranty. Commencing with the third quarter of 1998, Transatlantic and 21st Century were consolidated into AIG\\'s financial statements, as a result of AIG obtaining majority ownership. AIG\\'s primary domestic division is the Domestic Brokerage Group (DBG). DBG\\'s business is derived from brokers in the United States and Canada and is conducted through its general insurance subsidiaries including American Home, National Union, Lexington, Transatlantic and certain other insurance company subsidiaries of AIG. The risk management division of DBG provides insurance and risk management programs for large corporate customers. The AIG Risk Finance division designs and implements creative risk financing alternatives using the insurance and financial services capabilities of AIG. Also included are the operations of DBG\\'s environmental unit which focuses specifically on providing specialty products to clients with environmental exposures. DBG writes substantially all classes of business insurance accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers. This provides DBG the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to submit business to DBG without the traditional agent-company contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no authority to commit DBG to accept a risk. In addition to writing substantially all classes of business insurance, including large commercial or industrial property insurance, excess liability, inland marine, environmental, workers\\' compensation and excess and umbrella coverages, DBG offers many specialized forms of insurance such as equipment breakdown, directors and officers liability, difference-in-conditions, kidnap-ransom, export credit and political risk, and various types of professional errors and omissions coverages. Lexington writes surplus lines, those risks for which conventional insurance companies do not readily provide insurance coverage, either because of complexity or because the coverage does not lend itself to conventional contracts. AIG engages in mass marketing of personal lines coverages, primarily private passenger auto and homeowners and personal umbrella coverages, principally through American International Insurance Company and 21st Century. The business of United Guaranty Corporation (\"UGC\") and its subsidiaries is also included in the domestic operations of AIG. The principal business of the UGC subsidiaries is the writing of residential mortgage loan insurance, which is guaranty insurance on conventional first mortgage loans on single-family dwellings and condominiums. Such insurance protects lenders against loss if borrowers default. UGC subsidiaries also write home equity and property improvement loan insurance on loans to finance residential property improvements, alterations and repairs and for other purposes not necessarily related to real estate. UGC had approximately $22 billion of mortgage guarantee risk in-force at December 31, 2000. AIG\\'s Foreign General insurance group accepts risks primarily underwritten through American International Underwriters (\"AIU\"), a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned agencies and insurance companies. The Foreign General insurance group also includes business written by AIG\\'s foreign-based insurance subsidiaries for their own accounts. The Foreign General group uses various marketing methods to write both business and personal lines insurance with certain refinements for local laws, customs and needs. AIU operates in over 70 countries in Asia, the Pacific Rim, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America. Transatlantic\\'s foreign operations are included in this group. During 2000, DBG and the Foreign General insurance group accounted for 50.2 percent and 32.9 percent, respectively, of AIG\\'s net premiums written. AIG\\'s general insurance company subsidiaries worldwide operate primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account and securing reinsurance on that portion of the risk in excess of the limit which they wish to retain. This operating policy differs from that of many insurance companies which will underwrite only up to their net retention limit, thereby requiring the broker or agent to secure commitments from other underwriters for the remainder of the gross risk amount. The following table summarizes general insurance premiums written and earned:\\nThe utilization of reinsurance is closely monitored by an internal reinsurance security committee, consisting of members of AIG\\'s senior management. No single reinsurer is a material reinsurer to AIG nor is AIG\\'s business substantially dependent upon any reinsurance contract. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG is well diversified both in terms of lines of business and geographic locations. Of the general insurance lines of business, workers\\' compensation was approximately 9 percent of AIG\\'s net premiums written. This line is well diversified geographically. The majority of AIG\\'s general insurance business is in the casualty classes, which tend to involve longer periods of time for the reporting and settling of claims. This may increase the risk and uncertainty with respect to AIG\\'s loss reserve development. (See also the Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development and Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nLoss and expense ratios of AIG\\'s consolidated general insurance operations are set forth in the following table. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\n*Source: Best\\'s Aggregates & Averages (Stock insurance companies, after dividends to policyholders); the ratio for 2000 reflects estimated results. During 2000, of the direct general insurance premiums written (gross premiums less return premiums and cancellations, excluding reinsurance assumed and before deducting reinsurance ceded), 12.7 percent and 6.9 percent were written in California and New York respectively. No other state accounted for more than 5 percent of such premiums. There was no significant adverse effect on AIG\\'s general insurance results of operations from the economic environments in any one state, country or geographic region for the year ended December 31, 2000. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nDiscussion and Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development\\nThe reserve for net losses and loss expenses represents the accumulation of estimates for reported losses (\"case basis reserves\") and provisions for losses incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\"), both reduced by applicable reinsurance recoverable. Losses and loss expenses are charged to income as incurred. AIG discounts certain of its loss reserves principally related to workers\\' compensation lines of business. Loss reserves established with respect to foreign business are set and monitored in terms of the respective local or functional currency. Therefore, no assumption is included for changes in currency rates. (See also Note 1(t) of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nManagement continually reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves through the utilization of a number of analytical reserve development techniques. Through the use of these techniques, management is able to monitor the adequacy of its established reserves and determine appropriate assumptions for inflation. Also, analysis of emerging specific development patterns, such as case reserve redundancies or deficiencies and IBNR emergence, allows management to currently determine any required adjustments. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nThe \"Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development\", which follows, presents the development of net losses and loss expense reserves for calendar years 1990 through 2000. The upper half of the table shows the cumulative amounts paid during successive years related to the opening loss reserves. For example, with respect to the net losses and loss expense reserve of $17.56 billion as of December 31, 1993, by the end of 2000 (seven years later) $14.97 billion had actually been paid in settlement of these net loss reserves. In addition, as reflected in the lower section of the table, the original reserve of $17.56 billion was reestimated to be $18.63 billion at December 31, 2000. This increase from the original estimate would generally be a combination of a number of factors, including reserves being settled for larger amounts than originally estimated.'),\n",

The redundancy (deficiency) depicted in the table, for any particular calendar year, shows the aggregate change in estimates over the period of years subsequent to the calendar year reflected at the top of the respective column heading. For example, the redundancy of $335 million at December 31, 2000 related to December 31, 1999 net losses and loss expense reserves of $24.60 billion represents the cumulative amount by which reserves for 1999 and prior years have developed redundantly during 2000. The reserve for net losses and loss expenses with respect to Transatlantic and 21st Century are included only in the consolidated net losses and loss expenses commencing with the year ended December 31, 1998. Reserve development for these operations is included only for 1998 and subsequent periods. Over the past several years, AIG has strengthened its net loss and loss expense reserves with respect to asbestos and environmental losses. This strengthening is the primary cause of the adverse development reflected in certain calendar years in the net loss and loss expense reserves shown in the following table. Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development\\nThe following table excludes for each calendar year the net loss and loss expense reserves and the development thereof with respect to asbestos and environmental claims. Thus, AIG\\'s loss and loss expense reserves excluding asbestos and environmental claims are developing adequately. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nAnalysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development Excluding Asbestos and Environmental Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development\\nReconciliation of Net Reserve for Losses and Loss Expenses\\n(a) Acquisitions include the opening balances with respect to HSB in 2000 and Transatlantic and 21st Century in 1998. (b) Does not include the effects of foreign exchange adjustments which are reflected in the \"Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development\" table. (c) See also Note 6(a) of Notes to Financial Statements. Approximately 48 percent of the net losses and loss expense reserves are paid out within two years of the date incurred. The remaining net losses and loss expense reserves, particularly those associated with the casualty lines of business, may extend to 20 years or more. For further discussion regarding net reserves for losses and loss expenses, see Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The reserve for losses and loss expenses as reported in AIG\\'s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2000, differs from the total reserve reported in the Annual Statements filed with state insurance departments and, where appropriate, with foreign regulatory authorities. The differences at December 31, 2000 relate primarily to reserves for certain foreign operations. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nThe reserve for gross losses and loss expenses is prior to reinsurance and represents the accumulation for reported losses and IBNR. Management reviews the adequacy of established gross loss reserves in the manner previously described for net loss reserves. The \"Analysis of Consolidated Gross Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development\", which follows, presents the development of gross losses and loss expense reserves for calendar years 1992 through 2000.'),\n",

Analysis of Consolidated Gross Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development\\nLife Insurance Operations\\nAIG's life insurance subsidiaries offer a wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment products. One or more of these subsidiaries is licensed to write life insurance in all states in the United States and in over 70 foreign countries. Traditional products consist of individual and group life, annuity, endowment and accident and health policies. Financial and investment products consist of single premium annuity, variable annuities, guaranteed investment contracts, universal life and pensions. (See also Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nLife insurance operations in foreign countries comprised 90.8 percent of life premium income and 66.2 percent of operating income in 2000. AIG operates overseas principally through American Life Insurance Company (ALICO), American International Assurance Company, Limited together with American International Assurance Company (Bermuda) Limited (AIA) and Nan Shan Life Insurance Company, Ltd. (Nan Shan). ALICO is incorporated in Delaware and all of its business is written outside of the United States. ALICO has operations either directly or through subsidiaries in approximately 50 countries located in Europe, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and the Far East, with Japan being the largest territory. AIA operates primarily in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. Nan Shan operates in Taiwan. These operations comprised 88.1 percent of AIG's consolidated life premium income in 2000. (See also Note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG's domestic life operations are comprised of two separate operations, AIG's domestic life companies and the life insurance subsidiaries of SunAmerica. AIG's domestic life subsidiaries are American International Life Assurance Company of New York and AIG Life Insurance Company. These companies utilize multiple distribution channels including brokerage and career and general agents to offer primarily life insurance, financial and investment products and specialty forms of accident and health coverage for individuals and groups, including employee benefit plans. SunAmerica sells primarily financial and investment type products. The domestic life operations comprised 9.2 percent of total life premium income in 2000. There was no significant adverse effect on AIG's life insurance results of operations from economic environments in any one state, country or geographic region for the year ended December 31, 2000. (See also Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nTraditional life insurance products such as whole life and endowment continue to be significant in the overseas companies, especially in Southeast Asia, while a mixture of traditional, accident and health and financial products are sold in Japan. In addition to the above, AIG also has subsidiary operations in the Philippines, Canada, Mexico, Poland, Switzerland, Puerto Rico, and conducts life insurance business through AIUO subsidiary companies in Russia, Israel and in certain countries in Central and South America. The foreign life companies have over 140,000 career agents and sell their products largely to indigenous persons in local currencies. In addition to the agency outlets, these companies also distribute their products through direct marketing channels, such as mass marketing, and through brokers and other distribution outlets such as financial institutions. The following tables summarize the life insurance operating results for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998.

For the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, 63.1 percent, 64.7 percent and 68.0 percent, respectively, of consolidated life operating income before realized capital losses was derived from foreign operations.

AIG's worldwide insurance investment policy places primary emphasis on investments in high quality, fixed income securities in all of its portfolios and, to a lesser extent, investments in marketable common stocks in order to preserve policyholders' surplus and generate net investment income. The ability to implement this policy is somewhat limited in certain territories as there may be a lack of qualified long term investments or investment restrictions may be imposed by the local regulatory authorities.

Additional Investments\\nAIG holds a 24.4 percent interest in IPC Holdings, Ltd., a reinsurance holding company and a 19.9 percent interest in Richmond Insurance Company, Ltd., a reinsurer. (See also Note 1(o) of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nLocations of Certain Assets\\nAs of December 31, 2000, approximately 32 percent of the consolidated assets of AIG were located in foreign countries (other than Canada), including $816 million of cash and securities on deposit with foreign regulatory authorities. Foreign operations and assets held abroad may be adversely affected by political developments in foreign countries, including such possibilities as tax changes, nationalization and changes in regulatory policy, as well as by consequence of hostilities and unrest. The risks of such occurrences and their overall effect upon AIG vary from country to country and cannot easily be\\npredicted. If expropriation or nationalization does occur, AIG's policy is to take all appropriate measures to seek recovery of such assets. Certain of the countries in which AIG's business is conducted have currency restrictions which generally cause a delay in a company's ability to repatriate assets and profits. (See also Notes 1, 2 and 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nInsurance Regulation and Competition\\nCertain states require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies which are licensed in such states and are controlled by other corporations. Applicable legislation typically requires periodic disclosure concerning the corporation which controls the registered insurer and the other companies in the holding company system and prior approval of intercorporate transfers of assets (including in some instances payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiary) within the holding company system. AIG's subsidiaries are registered under such legislation in those states which have such requirements.(See also Note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG's insurance subsidiaries, in common with other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and by other jurisdictions in which they do business. Within the United States, the method of such regulation varies but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory and supervisory powers to an insurance official. The regulation and supervision relate primarily to approval of policy forms and rates, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, including risk based capital measurements, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on investments, restrictions on the size of risks which may be insured under a single policy, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, methods of accounting, periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies, the form and content of reports of financial condition required to be filed, and reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than security holders. (See also Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nRisk Based Capital (RBC) is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. Thus, inadequately capitalized general and life insurance companies may be identified. The RBC formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. Higher factors are applied to more risky items and lower factors are applied to less risky items. Thus, the target level of statutory surplus varies not only as a result of the insurer's size, but also on the risk profile of the insurer's operations. The RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control. The statutory surplus of each of AIG's domestic general and life insurance subsidiaries exceeded their RBC standards by considerable margins as of December 31, 2000. To the extent that any of AIG's insurance entities would fall below prescribed levels of surplus, it would be AIG's intention to infuse necessary capital to support that entity. Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act are fully effective in 2001 and establish new consumer protections regarding the security, confidentiality, and uses of nonpublic personal information of individuals. The law also requires financial institutions to disclose their privacy policies to their customers.\"),\n",

These statutes and regulations may result in additional regulatory compliance costs, limit AIG's ability to market its products, or otherwise constrain the nature or scope of AIG's insurance and financial services operations. A substantial portion of AIG's general insurance business and a majority of its life insurance business is carried on in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies from minimal in some to stringent in others. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification or revocation by such authorities, and AIU or other AIG subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. In the past, AIU has been allowed to modify its operations to conform with new licensing requirements in most jurisdictions. In addition to licensing requirements, AIG's foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, policy language and terms, amount and type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of local investment and the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on participating policies. Some foreign countries regulate rates on various types of policies. Certain countries have established reinsurance institutions, wholly or partially owned by the state, to which admitted insurers are obligated to cede a portion of their business on terms which do not always allow foreign insurers, including AIG, full compensation. In some countries, regulations governing constitution of technical reserves and remittance balances may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets. The insurance industry is highly competitive. Within the United States, AIG's general insurance subsidiaries compete with approximately 3,000 other stock companies, specialty insurance organizations, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations. AIG's life insurance companies compete in the United States with some 1,700 life insurance companies and other participants in related financial service fields. Overseas, AIG subsidiaries compete for business with foreign insurance operations of the larger U.S. insurers and local companies in particular areas in which they are active. AIG's financial services subsidiaries, particularly AIGTG and AIGFP, operate in a highly competitive environment, both domestically and overseas. Principal sources of competition are banks, investment banks and other non-bank financial institutions.\"),\n",

Operational Review\\nGeneral Insurance Operations\\nAIG\\'s general insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance. Domestic general insurance operations are comprised of the Domestic Brokerage Group (DBG), which includes The Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company (HSB) and the domestic operations of Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (Transatlantic), Personal Lines, including 21st Century Insurance Group (21st Century), and Mortgage Guaranty. Commencing with the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2000, HSB, and the third quarter of 1998, Transatlantic and 21st Century were consolidated into AIG\\'s financial statements, as a result of AIG obtaining majority ownership. DBG is AIG\\'s primary domestic division. DBG writes substantially all classes of business insurance, accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers. This provides DBG the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to submit business to DBG without the traditional agent-company contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no authority to commit DBG to accept a risk. Personal Lines engages in the mass marketing of personal lines insurance, primarily private passenger auto and homeowners and personal umbrella coverages. Mortgage Guaranty provides guaranty insurance on conventional first mortgage loans on single family dwellings and condominiums. AIG\\'s Foreign General insurance group accepts risks primarily underwritten through American International Underwriters (AIU), a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned agencies and insurance entities. The Foreign General insurance group also includes business written by AIG\\'s foreign-based insurance subsidiaries for their own accounts. The Foreign General insurance group uses various marketing methods to write both business and personal lines insurance with certain refinements for local laws, customs and needs. AIU operates in over 70 countries in Asia, the Pacific Rim, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America. Transatlantic\\'s foreign operations are included in this group. (See also Note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nGeneral insurance operations for the twelve month periods ending December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 were as follows:\\n*Reflects the realignment of certain internal divisions. In AIG\\'s general insurance operations, 2000 net premiums written and net premiums earned increased 8.0 percent and 12.0 percent, respectively, from those of 1999. During 2000, AIG cancelled or non-renewed approximately $380 million of business worldwide that did not meet AIG\\'s underwrit-\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\ning standards. In 1999, net premiums written increased 11.2 percent and net premiums earned increased 10.3 percent when compared to 1998. General insurance domestic net premiums written and net premiums earned were as follows:\\n*Reflects the realignment of certain internal divisions. Commencing in the latter part of 1999 and continuing through 2000, the commercial property-casualty market place has experienced rate increases. Virtually all areas of DBG have experienced rate increases. Overall, DBG\\'s net premiums written increased $508 million or 6.1 percent in 2000 over 1999. These increases compared to an increase of $106 million or 1.3 percent in 1999 over 1998. Personal Lines\\' net premiums written increased 16.1 percent or $348 million in 2000 over 1999, compared to an increase of 52.0 percent or $740 million in 1999 over 1998. The growth in 2000 primarily resulted from an increase in the number of policies issued with respect to preferred, standard and non-standard auto risks. 21st Century was consolidated into AIG\\'s Personal Lines results for the twelve months of 1999 and last six months of 1998. Approximately half the growth in 1999 over 1998 was attributable to the inclusion of twelve months of operations of 21st Century. The remainder of the growth was due to the aforementioned growth in policy issuance. AIG has filed for rate increases in a number of states where inadequate rates persist. Growth of 7.3 percent for both foreign general insurance net premiums written and net premiums earned in 2000 over 1999 reflect growth of operations in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and the Far East. Growth of 16.4 percent and 19.0 percent for foreign general insurance net premiums written and net premiums earned, respectively, reflect growth of operations in the same aforementioned geographic regions and the consolidation of Transatlantic\\'s foreign operations for twelve months in 1999 compared to six months in 1998. Foreign general insurance operations produced 32.9 percent of the general insurance net premiums written in 2000, 33.1 percent in 1999 and 31.6 percent in 1998. Differences in foreign exchange rates during 2000 relative to 1999 had a negligible effect on foreign general insurance net premiums written when translated from original currencies into U.S. dollars.'),\n",

Net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies. The net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period. Thus, the net unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized as net premiums earned until the end of the policy period. AIG, along with most general insurance entities, uses the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of performance. The loss ratio is the sum of losses and loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned.'),\n",

The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. These ratios are relative measurements that describe for every $100 of net premiums earned or written, the cost of losses and statutory expenses, respectively. The combined ratio presents the total cost per $100 of premium production. A combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit; a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting loss. The statutory general insurance ratios were as follows:\\nAIG believes that underwriting profit is the true measure of the performance of the core business of a general insurance company. Underwriting profit is measured in two ways: statutory underwriting profit and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) underwriting profit. Statutory underwriting profit is arrived at by reducing net premiums earned by net losses and loss expenses incurred and net expenses incurred. Statutory accounting differs from GAAP, as statutory accounting requires immediate expense recognition and ignores the matching of revenues and expenses as required by GAAP. That is, for statutory purposes, all expenses, most specifically acquisition expenses, are recognized immediately, not consistent with the revenues earned. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (CONTINUED)\\nA basic premise of GAAP accounting is the recognition of expenses at the same time revenues are earned, the principle of matching. Therefore, to convert underwriting results to a GAAP basis, acquisition expenses are deferred and recognized together with the related revenues. Accordingly, the statutory underwriting profit has been adjusted as a result of acquisition expenses being deferred as required by GAAP. Thus, \"adjusted underwriting profit\" is a GAAP measurement which can be viewed as gross margin or an intermediate subtotal in calculating operating income and net income. A major part of the discipline of a successful general insurance company is to produce an underwriting profit, exclusive of investment income. If underwriting is not profitable, losses incurred are a major factor. The result is that the premiums are inadequate to pay for losses and expenses and produce a profit; therefore, investment income must be used to cover underwriting losses. If assets and the income therefrom are insufficient to pay claims and expenses over extended periods, an insurance company cannot survive. For these reasons, AIG views and manages its underwriting operations separately from its investment operations. The adjusted underwriting profits were $785 million in 2000, $669 million in 1999 and $531 million in 1998. Domestic adjusted underwriting profit increased primarily as a result of the disciplined underwriting of DBG. In 1999, foreign underwriting profit declined primarily as a result of catastrophe losses from European storms. The regulatory, product type and competitive environment as well as the degree of litigation activity in any one country varies significantly.'),\n",

(See also Notes 4 and 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG\\'s results reflect the net impact of incurred losses from catastrophes approximating $44 million in 2000, $156 million in 1999 and $110 million in 1998. AIG\\'s gross incurred losses from catastrophes approximated $112 million in 2000, $472 million in 1999 and $625 million in 1998. The impact of losses caused by catastrophes can fluctuate widely from year to year, making comparisons of recurring type business more difficult. The pro forma table below excludes catastrophe losses in order to present comparable results of AIG\\'s recurring core underwriting operations. The pro forma consolidated statutory general insurance ratios would be as follows:\\nAIG\\'s historic ability to maintain its combined ratio below 100 is primarily attributable to the profitability of AIG\\'s foreign general insurance operations and AIG\\'s emphasis on maintaining its disciplined underwriting, especially in the domestic specialty markets. In addition, AIG does not seek net premium growth where rates do not adequately reflect its assessment of exposures. General insurance net investment income in 2000 increased 7.3 percent when compared to 1999. In 1999, net investment income increased 14.8 percent over 1998. The growth in net investment income in each of the three years was primarily attributable to new cash flow for investment and the consolidation of Transatlantic and 21st Century for twelve months in 1999 compared to six months in 1998. The new cash flow was generated from net general insurance operating cash flow and included the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income. (See also the discussion under \"Liquidity\" herein and Note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nGeneral insurance realized capital gains were $38 million in 2000, $295 million in 1999 and $205 million in 1998. These realized gains resulted from the ongoing management of the general insurance investment portfolios within the overall objectives of the general insurance operations and arose primarily from the disposition of equity securities and available for sale fixed maturities as well as redemptions of fixed maturities. General insurance operating income in 2000 increased 1.3 percent when compared to 1999. The 1999 results reflect an increase of 18.9 percent from 1998. The contribution of general insurance operating income to income before income taxes and minority interest was 42.2 percent in 2000 compared to 46.3 percent in 1999 and 46.6 percent in 1998. AIG is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its general insurance operations. AIG is cognizant of the need to exercise good judgment in the selection and approval of both domestic and foreign companies participating in its reinsurance programs. AIG insures risks in over 70 countries and its reinsurance programs must be coordinated in order to provide AIG the level of reinsurance protection that AIG desires. These reinsurance arrangements do not relieve AIG from its direct obligations to its insureds. AIG\\'s general reinsurance assets amounted to $22.90 billion and resulted from AIG\\'s reinsurance arrangements. Thus, a credit exposure existed at December 31, 2000 with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer may not be able to reimburse AIG under the terms of these reinsurance arrangements. AIG manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound, and when necessary AIG holds substantial collateral in the form of funds, securities and/or irrevocable letters of credit. This collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods on an individual reinsurer basis. At December 31, 2000, approximately 43 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from unauthorized reinsurers. In order to obtain statutory recognition, nearly all of these balances were collateralized. The remaining 57 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from authorized reinsurers and over 95 percent of such balances\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nare from reinsurers rated A-(excellent) or better, as rated by A.M.

At that date AIG had no significant reinsurance recoverables from any individual reinsurer which is financially troubled (e.g., liquidated, insolvent, in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction). AIG's Reinsurance Security Department conducts ongoing detailed assessments of the reinsurance markets and current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic. Such assessments include, but are not limited to, identifying if a reinsurer is appropriately licensed, and has sufficient financial capacity, and the local economic environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates. This department also reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for collateral.

At December 31, 2000, the consolidated general reinsurance assets of $22.90 billion include reinsurance recoverables for paid losses and loss expenses of $3.33 billion and $15.66 billion with respect to the ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses, including ceded losses incurred but not reported (IBNR) (ceded reserves). The ceded reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate ceded losses including provisions for ceded IBNR and loss expenses. The methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting ceded reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments therefrom are reflected in income currently. It is AIG's belief that the ceded reserves at December 31, 2000 were representative of the ultimate losses recoverable. In the future, as the ceded reserves continue to develop to ultimate amounts, the ultimate loss recoverable may be greater or less than the reserves currently ceded. At December 31, 2000, general insurance reserves for losses and loss expenses (loss reserves) amounted to $40.61 billion. These loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including IBNR, and loss expenses and amounts of discounting related to certain workers' compensation claims. At December 31, 2000, general insurance net loss reserves increased $117 million from prior year end to $24.95 billion. The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance. The methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in operating income currently. It is management's belief that the general insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover all general insurance net losses and loss expenses as at December 31, 2000. In the future, if the general insurance net loss reserves develop deficiently, such deficiency would have an adverse impact on such future results of operations. In a very broad sense, the general loss reserves can be categorized into two distinct groups: one group being long tail casualty lines of business. Such lines include excess and umbrella liability, directors and officers' liability, professional liability, medical malpractice, general liability, products' liability, and related classes. These lines account for approximately one-half of net losses and loss expenses. The other group is short tail lines of business consisting principally of property lines, certain classes of casualty lines and includes personal lines. Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses (net losses) for long tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the line and volume of the business involved. In the more recent accident years of long tail casualty lines there is limited statistical credibility in reported net losses. That is, a relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims and expenses and an even smaller proportion would be net losses paid. A relatively high proportion of net losses would therefore be IBNR. A variety of actuarial methods and assumptions are normally employed to estimate net losses for long tail casualty lines. These methods ordinarily involve the use of loss trend factors intended to reflect the estimated annual growth in loss costs from one accident year to the next. For the majority of long tail casualty lines, net loss trend factors approximated four percent. Loss trend factors reflect many items including changes in claims handling, exposure and policy forms and current and future estimates of monetary inflation and social inflation. Thus, many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the year to year growth in loss costs. Therefore, AIG's carried net long tail loss reserves are judgmentally set as well as tested for reasonableness using the most appropriate loss trend factors for each class of business. In the evaluation of AIG's net loss reserves, loss trend factors vary slightly, depending on the particular class and nature of the business involved. These factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss experience. Estimation of net losses for short tail business is less complex than for long tail casualty lines. Loss cost trends for many property lines can generally be assumed to be similar to the growth in exposure of such lines. For example, if the fire insurance coverage remained proportional to the actual value of the property, the growth in property's exposure to fire loss can be approximated by the amount of insurance purchased. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (CONTINUED)\\nFor other property and short tail casualty lines, the loss trend is implicitly assumed to grow at the rate that reported net losses grow from one year to the next. The concerns noted above for longer tail casualty lines with respect to the limited statistical credibility of reported net losses generally do not apply to shorter tail lines. AIG continues to receive claims asserting injuries from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites (hereinafter referred to collectively as environmental claims) and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. The vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. AIG has established a specialized claims unit which investigates and adjusts all such asbestos and environmental claims. Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained an absolute exclusion for pollution related damage. However, AIG currently underwrites environmental impairment liability insurance on a claims made basis and excluded such claims from the analyses included herein. Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a difficult process. These asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated by conventional reserving techniques as previously described. Quantitative techniques frequently have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including managerial judgment. Significant factors which affect the trends which influence the development of asbestos and environmental claims are the inconsistent court resolutions and judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage. The current case law can be characterized as still evolving and there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop in the near future.\"),\n",

The cleanup cost exposure may significantly change if potential Congressional reauthorization of Superfund dramatically changes the current program. In the interim, AIG and other industry members have and will continue to litigate the broadening judicial interpretation of the policy coverage and the liability issues. At the current time, it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the same degree of reliability as is the case for other types of claims. Such development will be affected by the extent to which courts continue to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage, as they have in the past, as well as by the changes in Superfund and waste dump site coverage issues. Although the estimated liabilities for these claims are subject to a significantly greater margin of error than for other claims, the reserves carried for these claims at December 31, 2000 are believed to be adequate as these reserves are based on the known facts and current law. Furthermore, as AIG's net exposure retained relative to the gross exposure written was lower in 1984 and prior years, the potential impact of these claims is much smaller on the net loss reserves than on the gross loss reserves. In the future, if the environmental claims develop deficiently, such deficiency would have an adverse impact on future results of operations. (See the previous discussion on reinsurance collectibility herein.)\\nThe majority of AIG's exposures for asbestos and environmental claims are excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. Thus, the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity reserves. That is, litigation expenses are included within the limits of the liability AIG incurs.

Best, an insurance rating agency, has developed a survival ratio to measure the number of years it would take a company to exhaust both its asbestos and environmental reserves for losses and loss expenses based on that company's current level of asbestos and environmental claims payments. This is a ratio derived by taking the current ending losses and loss expense reserves and dividing by the average annual payments for the prior three years. Therefore, the ratio derived is a simplistic measure of an estimate of the number of years it would be before the current ending losses and loss expense reserves would be paid off using recent average payments. The higher the ratio, the more years the reserves for losses and loss expenses cover these claims payments. These ratios are computed based on the ending reserves for losses and loss expenses over the respective claims settlements during the fiscal year. Such payments include indemnity payments and legal and loss adjustment payments. It should be noted, however, that this is an extremely simplistic approach to measuring asbestos and environmental reserve levels. Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have significant impact on the amount of asbestos and environmental losses and loss expense reserves, ultimate payments thereof and the resultant ratio. The developed survival ratios include both involuntary and voluntary indemnity payments. Involuntary payments are primarily attributable to court judgments, court orders, covered claims with no coverage defenses, state mandated cleanup costs, claims where AIG's coverage defenses are minimal, and settlements made less than six months before the first trial setting. Also, AIG considers all legal and loss adjustment payments as involuntary. AIG believes voluntary indemnity payments should be excluded from the survival ratio. The special asbestos and environmental claims unit actively manages AIG's asbestos and environmental claims and proactively pursues early settlement of environmental claims for all known and unknown sites. As a result, AIG reduces its exposure to future environmental loss contingencies. AIG's survival ratios for involuntary asbestos and environmental claims, separately and combined, were based upon a three year average payment. These ratios for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 were as follows:\\nAIG's operations are negatively impacted under guarantee fund assessment laws which exist in most states.

In early 2001, AICCO ceased issuing commercial paper under its program and the agreement which AIG had provided supporting the commercial paper was terminated; AICCO\\'s funding requirements are now met through Funding\\'s program. (See also the discussion under \"Derivatives\" herein and Note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG and Funding have entered into syndicated revolving credit facilities (collectively, the Facility) aggregating $1.5 billion. The Facility consists of $1.0 billion in short-term revolving credit facilities and a $500 million five year revolving credit facility. The Facility can be used for general corporate purposes and also to provide backup for AIG\\'s commercial paper programs administered by Funding. There are currently no borrowings outstanding under the Facility, nor were any borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2000. At December 31, 2000, ILFC had increased the aggregate principal amount outstanding of its medium term and term notes to $8.70 billion, a net increase of $462 million, and recorded a net decline in its capital lease obligations of $207 million and a net increase in its commercial paper of $1.30 billion. At December 31, 2000, ILFC had $75 million in aggregate principal amount of debt securities registered for issuance from time to time, which debt had been sold as of March 16, 2001. An additional $2.0 billion principal amount of debt securities was registered as of January 5, 2001, under which $800 million in notes were sold as of March 16, 2001. A $750 million Medium Term Note program was implemented on January 19, 2001 under which $200 million has been sold as of March 16, 2001. In addition, ILFC established a Euro Medium Term Note Program for $2.0 billion, under which $771 million in notes were sold through December 31, 2000. ILFC has an Export Credit Facility up to a maximum of $4.3 billion, for approximately 75 aircraft to be delivered through 2001. ILFC has the right, but is not required, to use the facility to fund 85 percent of each aircraft\\'s purchase price. This facility is guaranteed by various European Export Credit Agencies. The interest rate varies from 5.75 percent to 5.90 percent on the first 75 aircraft depending on the delivery date of the aircraft. Through March 9, 2001, ILFC borrowed $2.2 billion under this facility. Borrowings with respect to this facility are included in Notes and Bonds Payable in the accompanying table of borrowings. The proceeds of ILFC\\'s debt financing are primarily used to purchase flight equipment, including progress payments during the construction phase. The primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are the cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of flight equipment and the rollover and refinancing of the prior debt.

Retained earnings increased $3.26 billion, resulting from net income less dividends. During 2000, AIG repurchased in the open market 10,351,600 shares of its common stock. Through March 22, 2001, AIG repurchased in the open market 2,525,000 shares of its common stock. AIG intends to continue to buy its common shares in the open market for general corporate purposes, including to satisfy its obligations under various employee benefit plans. Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by statutory authorities. AIG has in the past reinvested most of its unrestricted earnings in its operations and believes such continued reinvestment in the future will be adequate to meet any foreseeable capital needs. However, AIG may choose from time to time to raise additional funds through the issuance of additional securities.

At December 31, 2000, the adjusted capital of each of AIG\\'s domestic general companies and of each of AIG\\'s domestic life companies exceeded each of their RBC standards by considerable margins. A substantial portion of AIG\\'s general insurance business and a majority of its life insurance business are conducted in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies from minimal in some to stringent in others. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. Thus, AIG\\'s insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. AIG\\'s international operations include operations in various developing nations. Both current and future foreign operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable political developments up to and including nationalization of AIG\\'s operations without compensation. Adverse effects resulting from any one country may impact AIG\\'s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition depending on the magnitude of the event and AIG\\'s net financial exposure at that time in that country. Liquidity\\nAIG\\'s liquidity is primarily derived from the operating cash flows of its general and life insurance operations. At December 31, 2000, AIG\\'s consolidated invested assets included $6.09 billion of cash and short-term investments. Consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in 2000 amounted to $5.94 billion. Sources of funds considered in meeting the objectives of AIG\\'s financial services operations include guaranteed investment agreements, issuance of long and short-term debt, maturities and sales of securities available for sale, securities sold under repurchase agreements, trading liabilities, securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased, issuance of equity, and cash provided from such operations. AIG\\'s strong capital position is integral to managing this liquidity, as it enables AIG to raise funds in diverse markets worldwide. (See also the discussions under \"Capital Resources\" herein.)\\nManagement believes that AIG\\'s liquid assets, its net cash provided by operations, and access to the capital markets will enable it to meet any foreseeable cash requirements. The liquidity of the combined insurance operations is derived both domestically and abroad. The combined insurance operating cash flow is derived from two sources, underwriting operations and investment operations. In the aggregate, AIG\\'s insurance operations generated approximately $15.2 billion in pre-tax cash flow during 2000. Cash flow includes periodic premium collections, including policyholders\\' contract deposits, paid loss recoveries less reinsurance premiums, losses, benefits, acquisition and operating expenses. Generally, there is a time lag from when premiums are collected and, when as a result of the occurrence of events specified in the policy, the losses and benefits are paid. AIG\\'s insurance investment operations generated approximately $9.4 billion in investment income cash flow during 2000. Investment income cash flow is primarily derived from interest and dividends received and includes realized capital gains net of realized capital losses. In addition to the combined insurance pre-tax operating cash flow, AIG\\'s insurance operations held $5.52 billion in cash and short-term investments at December 31, 2000. The aforementioned operating cash flow and the cash and short-term balances held provided AIG\\'s insurance operations with a significant amount of liquidity. This liquidity is available, among other things, to purchase high quality and diversified fixed income securities and to a lesser extent marketable equity securities and to provide mortgage loans on real estate, policy loans and collateral loans. This cash flow coupled with proceeds of approximately $36 billion from the maturities, sales and redemptions of fixed income securities and from the sale of equity securities was used to purchase approximately $46 billion of fixed income securities and marketable equity securities during 2000. The following table is a summary of AIG\\'s invested assets by significant segment, including investment income due and accrued of $2.42 billion and $2.05 billion and real estate of $1.87 billion and $1.62 billion, at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively:\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nInsurance Invested Assets\\nThe following tables summarize the composition of AIG\\'s insurance invested assets by insurance segment, including investment income due and accrued and real estate, at December 31, 2000 and 1999:\\n(a) Includes $846 million of bonds trading securities, at market value.

(b) Includes $697 million of non-redeemable preferred stocks, at market value. Generally, insurance regulations restrict the types of assets in which an insurance company may invest. With respect to fixed maturities, AIG\\'s general strategy is to invest in high quality securities while maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure to issuer, industry and/or country concentrations. With respect to general insurance, AIG\\'s strategy is to invest in longer duration fixed maturities to maximize the yields at the date of purchase. With respect to life insurance, AIG\\'s strategy is to produce cash flows required to meet maturing insurance liabilities (See also the discussion under \"Operational Review: Life Insurance Operations\" herein.)\\nThe fixed maturity available for sale portfolio is subject to decline in fair value as interest rates rise. Such declines in fair value are presented as a component of comprehensive income in unrealized appreciation of investments, net of taxes. The fixed maturities held to maturity portfolio is exposed to adverse interest rate fluctuations. However, AIG has the ability and intent to hold such securities to maturity. Therefore, there would be no detrimental impact to AIG\\'s results of operations or financial condition as a result of such fluctuations. At December 31, 2000, approximately 57 percent of the fixed maturities investments were domestic securities. Approximately 37 percent of such domestic securities were rated AAA. Approximately 13 percent were below investment grade or not rated. A significant portion of the foreign insurance fixed income portfolio is rated by Moody\\'s, Standard & Poor\\'s (S&P) or similar foreign services. Similar credit quality rating services are not available in all overseas locations. AIG annually reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio nonrated fixed income investments, including mortgages. At December 31, 2000, approximately 11 percent of the foreign fixed income investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of AIG\\'s internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities so rated. Approximately 16 percent were below investment grade or not rated at that date. A large portion of the foreign insurance fixed income portfolio are sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting the policy liabilities in the country of issuance. At December 31, 2000, approximately 17 percent of the fixed maturities portfolio was collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), including commercial mortgage backed securities. Substantially all of the CMOs were invest-\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (CONTINUED)\\nment grade and approximately 16 percent of the CMOs were backed by various U.S. government agencies. CMOs are exposed to interest rate risk as the duration and ultimate realized yield would be affected by the accelerated prepayments of the underlying mortgages. Any fixed income security may be subject to downgrade for a variety of reasons subsequent to any balance sheet date. AIG invests in equities for various reasons, including diversifying its overall exposure to interest rate risk. Equity securities are subject to declines in fair value. Such declines in fair value are presented in unrealized appreciation of investments, net of taxes as a component of comprehensive income. Mortgage loans on real estate, policy and collateral loans comprised 7.5 percent of AIG\\'s insurance invested assets at December 31, 2000. AIG\\'s insurance operations\\' holdings of real estate mortgages amounted to $6.73 billion of which 78.3 percent was domestic. At December 31, 2000, only a nominal amount were in default. It is AIG\\'s practice to maintain a maximum loan to value ratio of 75 percent at loan origination. At December 31, 2000, AIG\\'s insurance holdings of collateral loans amounted to $868 million, all of which were foreign. It is AIG\\'s strategy to enter into mortgage and collateral loans as an adjunct primarily to life insurance fixed maturity investments. AIG\\'s policy loans increased from $2.82 billion at December 31, 1999 to $3.03 billion at December 31, 2000. Short-term investments represent amounts invested in various internal and external money market funds, time deposits and cash held. AIG\\'s real estate investment properties are primarily occupied by AIG\\'s various operations. The current market value of these properties considerably exceeds their carrying value. Other invested assets were primarily comprised of both foreign and domestic private placements, limited partnerships and outside managed funds. When permitted by regulatory authorities and when deemed necessary to protect insurance assets, including invested assets, from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, AIG and its insurance subsidiaries may enter into derivative transactions as end users. To date, such activities have not been significant. (See also the discussion under \"Derivatives\" herein.)\\nIn certain jurisdictions, significant regulatory and/or foreign governmental barriers exist which may not permit the immediate free flow of funds between insurance subsidiaries or from the insurance subsidiaries to AIG parent. These barriers generally cause only minor delays in the outward remittance of the funds. AIG\\'s insurance operations are exposed to market risk. Market risk is the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices. Measuring potential losses in fair values has recently become the focus of risk management efforts by many companies. Such measurements are performed through the application of various statistical techniques. One such technique is Value at Risk (VaR). VaR is a summary statistical measure that uses historical interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices and estimates the volatility and correlation of each of these rates and prices to calculate the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time given a certain probability. AIG believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk. While VaR models are relatively sophisticated, the quantitative market risk information generated is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related models. Therefore, such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management. AIG has performed a VaR analysis to estimate the maximum potential loss of fair value for each of AIG\\'s insurance segments and for each market risk within each insurance segment. In this analysis, financial instrument assets include the domestic and foreign invested assets excluding real estate and investment income due and accrued. Financial instrument liabilities include reserve for losses and loss expenses, reserve for unearned premiums, future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and policyholders\\' funds. Due to the nature of each insurance segment, AIG manages the general and life insurance operations separately. As a result, AIG manages separately the invested assets of each. Accordingly, the VaR analysis was separately performed for the general and the life insurance operations. AIG calculated the VaR with respect to the net fair value of each of AIG\\'s insurance segments as of December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999. AIG has refined its methodology for calculating VaR and the results of the calculations presented herein were performed using historical simulation. Using historical simulation over the delta-normal approach does not significantly change the results of this disclosure.'),\n",

A one month holding period was assumed in computing the VaR figure.

The average VaR for 2000 for each of AIG\\'s insurance segments was approximately $811 million for general insurance and $1.16 billion for life insurance. The high and low VaRs for general insurance during 2000 were approximately $954 million and $737 million, respectively. The high and low VaRs for life insurance during 2000 were approximately $1.21 billion and $1.11 billion, respectively.

Financial Services and Asset Management Invested Assets\\nThe following table is a summary of the composition of AIG\\'s financial services and asset management invested assets at December 31, 2000 and 1999. (See also the discussions under \"Operational Review: Financial Services Operations\", \"Operational Review: Asset Management Operations\", \"Capital Resources\" and \"Derivatives\" herein.)\\nAs previously discussed, the cash used for the purchase of flight equipment is derived primarily from the proceeds of ILFC\\'s debt financings. The primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are the cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of flight equipment and the rollover and refinancing of the prior debt. During 2000, ILFC acquired flight equipment costing $3.43 billion. At December 31, 2000, ILFC had committed to purchase 488 aircraft deliverable from 2001 through 2009 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $27.3 billion and had options to purchase 51 aircraft deliverable from 2001 through 2008 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $3.0 billion. As of March 15, 2001, ILFC has entered into leases for all of the aircraft to be delivered in 2001 and 96 of 421 aircraft to be delivered subsequent to 2001. ILFC will be required to find customers for any aircraft presently on order and any aircraft to be ordered, and it must arrange financing for portions of the purchase price of such equipment. In a rising interest rate environment, ILFC negotiates higher lease rates on any new contracts. ILFC has been successful to date both in placing its new aircraft on lease or under sales contract and obtaining adequate financing. ILFC is exposed to market risk and the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates. As of December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999, AIG statistically measured the aforementioned loss of fair value through the application of a VaR model. In this analysis, the net fair value of ILFC was determined using the financial instrument assets which included the tax adjusted future flight equipment lease revenue and the financial instrument liabilities which included the future servicing of the current debt. The estimated impact of the current derivative positions was also taken into account. AIG calculated the VaR with respect to the net fair value of ILFC using the variance-covariance (delta-normal) methodology. This calculation also used daily historical interest rates for the two years ending December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999.'),\n",

Thus, the VaR measured the sensitivity of the assets and liabilities to the calculated interest rate exposures. These sensitivities were then applied to a database, which contained the historical ranges of movements in interest rates and the correlation among them. The results were aggregated to provide a single amount that depicts the maximum potential loss in fair value of a confidence level of 95 percent for a time period of one month.

AIGFP\\'s derivative transactions are carried at market value or at estimated fair value when market prices are not readily available. AIGFP reduces its economic risk exposure through similarly valued offsetting transactions including swaps, trading securities, options, forwards and futures. The estimated fair values of these transactions represent assessments of the present value of expected future cash flows. These transactions are exposed to liquidity risk if AIGFP were to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes that the impact of any such limited liquidity would not be significant to AIG\\'s financial condition or its overall liquidity. (See also the discussion under \"Operational Review: Financial Services Operations\" and \"Derivatives\" herein.)\\nAIGFP uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes and bonds and GIA borrowings to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities, including securities available for sale, at market, and derivative transactions. The funds may also be temporarily invested in securities purchased under agreements to resell. The proceeds from the disposal of the aforementioned securities available for sale and securities purchased under agreements to resell have been used to fund the maturing GIAs or other AIGFP financings.

Trading securities, at market value are marked to market daily and are held to meet the short-term risk management objectives of AIGFP. AIGTG conducts, as principal, market making and trading activities in foreign exchange, interest rates and precious and base metals. AIGTG owns inventories in the commodities in which it trades and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the use of swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts. AIGTG uses derivatives to manage the economic exposure of its various trading positions and transactions from adverse movements of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. AIGTG supports its trading activities largely through trading liabilities, unrealized losses on swaps, short-term borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities and commodities sold but not yet purchased. (See also the discussions under \"Capital Resources\" and \"Derivatives\" herein.)\\nThe gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses of AIGFP and AIGTG included in the financial services assets and liabilities at December 31, 2000 were as follows:\\n(a) See also Note 8(e) of Notes to Financial Statements. (b) These amounts are also presented as the respective balance sheet amounts. (c) At December 31, 2000, AIGTG\\'s replacement values with respect to interest rate and currency swaps were $484 million. AIGFP\\'s interest rate and currency risks on securities available for sale, at market, are managed by taking offsetting positions on a security by security basis, thereby offsetting a significant portion of the unrealized appreciation or depreciation. At December 31, 2000, the unrealized gains and losses remaining after the benefit of the offsets were $44 million and $11 million, respectively. Trading securities, at market value, and securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased, at market value are marked to market daily with the unrealized gain or loss being recognized in income at that time. These securities are held to meet the short-term risk management objectives of AIGFP and AIGTG. The senior management of AIG defines the policies and establishes general operating parameters for AIGFP and AIGTG. AIG\\'s senior management has established various oversight committees to review the various financial market, operational and credit issues of AIGFP and AIGTG. The senior managements of AIGFP and AIGTG report the results of their respective operations to and review future strategies with AIG\\'s senior management. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nAIG actively manages the exposures to limit potential losses, while maximizing the rewards afforded by these business opportunities. In doing so, AIG must continually manage a variety of exposures including credit, market, liquidity, operational and legal risks. Market risk arises principally from the uncertainty that future earnings are exposed to potential changes in volatility, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices. AIG generally controls its exposure to market risk by taking offsetting positions. AIG\\'s philosophy with respect to its financial services operations is to minimize or set limits for open or uncovered positions that are to be carried. Credit risk exposure is separately managed. (See the discussion on the management of credit risk below.)\\nAIG\\'s Market Risk Management Department provides detailed independent review of AIG\\'s market exposures, particularly those market exposures of AIGFP and AIGTG. This department determines whether AIG\\'s market risks, as well as those market risks of individual subsidiaries, are within the parameters established by AIG\\'s senior management. Well established market risk management techniques such as sensitivity analysis are used. Additionally, this department verifies that specific market risks of each of certain subsidiaries are managed and hedged by that subsidiary. AIGFP is exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of interest rates and the shape and slope of the yield curve. AIGFP hedges its exposure to interest rate risk by entering into transactions such as interest rate swaps and options and purchasing U.S. and foreign government obligations. AIGFP is exposed to market risk due to changes in and volatility of foreign currency exchange rates. AIGFP hedges its foreign currency exchange risk primarily through the use of currency swaps, options, forwards and futures. AIGFP is exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of equity prices which affect the value of securities or instruments that derive their value from a particular stock, a basket of stocks or a stock index. AIGFP reduces the risk of loss inherent in its inventory in equity securities by entering into hedging transactions, including equity swaps and options and purchasing U.S. and foreign government obligations. AIGFP does not seek to manage the market risk of each of its transactions through an individual offsetting transaction. Rather, AIGFP takes a portfolio approach to the management of its market risk exposure. AIGFP values its portfolio at market value or estimated fair value when market values are not readily available. These valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows of AIGFP\\'s transactions and may include reserves for such risks as are deemed appropriate by AIGFP\\'s and AIG\\'s management. AIGFP evaluates the portfolio\\'s discounted cash flows with reference to current market conditions, maturities within the portfolio and other relevant factors. Based upon this evaluation, AIGFP determines what, if any, offsetting transactions are necessary to reduce the market risk exposure of the portfolio. The aforementioned estimated fair values are based upon the use of valuation models. These models utilize, among other things, current interest, foreign exchange and volatility rates.'),\n",

Additionally, AIGFP operates in major business centers overseas and is essentially open for business 24 hours a day. Thus, the market exposure and offset strategies are monitored, reviewed and coordinated around the clock. Therefore, offsetting adjustments can be made as and when necessary from any AIGFP office in the world. As part of its monitoring and controlling of its exposure to market risk, AIGFP applies various testing techniques which reflect potential market movements. These techniques vary by currency and are regularly changed to reflect factors affecting the derivatives portfolio. In addition to the daily monitoring, AIGFP's senior management and local risk managers conduct a weekly review of the derivatives portfolio and existing hedges. This review includes an examination of the portfolio's risk measures, such as aggregate option sensitivity to movements in market variables. AIGFP's management may change these measures to reflect their judgment and evaluation of the dynamics of the markets. This management group will also determine whether additional or alternative action is required in order to manage the portfolio. All of AIGTG's market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for trading purposes. The fair values of AIGTG's financial instruments are exposed to market risk as a result of adverse market changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and adverse changes in the liquidity of the markets in which AIGTG trades. AIGTG's approach to managing market risk is to establish an appropriate offsetting position to a particular transaction or group of transactions depending upon the extent of market risk AIGTG expects to reduce. AIGTG's senior management has established positions and stop-loss limits for each line of business. AIGTG's traders are required to maintain positions within these limits. These positions are monitored during the day either manually and/or through on-line computer systems. In addition, these positions are reviewed by AIGTG's management. Reports which present each trading books position and the prior day's profit and loss are reviewed by traders, head traders and AIGTG's senior management. Based upon these and other reports, AIGTG's senior management may determine to adjust AIGTG's risk profile. AIGTG attempts to secure reliable current market prices, such as published prices or third party quotes, to value its derivatives. Where such prices are not available, AIGTG uses\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (CONTINUED)\\nan internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions. The methodology may reflect interest and exchange rates, commodity prices, volatility rates and other relevant factors. A significant portion of AIGTG's business is transacted in liquid markets. Certain of AIGTG's derivative product exposures are evaluated using simulation techniques which consider such factors as changes in currency and commodity prices, interest rates, volatility levels and the effect of time. AIGFP and AIGTG are both exposed to the risk of loss of fair value from adverse fluctuations in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices. AIG statistically measured the losses of fair value through the application of a VaR model. AIG separately calculated the VaR with respect to AIGFP and AIGTG, as AIG manages these operations separately. AIGFP's and AIGTG's asset and liability portfolios for which the VaR analyses were performed included over the counter and exchange traded investments, derivative instruments and commodities. Since the market risk with respect to securities available for sale, at market is substantially hedged, segregation of market sensitive instruments into trading and other than trading was not deemed necessary. AIG calculated the VaR with respect to AIGFP and AIGTG as of December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999. AIG has refined its methodology for calculating VaR and the results of the calculations presented herein were performed using historical simulation. Using historical simulation over the delta-normal approach does not significantly change the results of this disclosure.\"),\n",

An interest rate swap is a contract between two parties to exchange interest rate payments (typically a fixed interest rate versus a variable interest rate) calculated on a notional principal amount for a specified period of time. The notional amount is not exchanged. Currency and equity swaps are similar to interest rate swaps but may involve the exchange of principal amounts at the commencement and termination of the swap. Swaptions are options where the holder has the right but not the obligation to enter into a swap transaction or cancel an existing swap transaction. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nA futures or forward contract is a legal contract between two parties to purchase or sell at a specified future date a specified quantity of a commodity, security, currency, financial index or other instrument, at a specified price. A futures contract is traded on an exchange, while a forward contract is executed over the counter. Over the counter derivatives are not transacted in an exchange traded environment. The futures exchanges maintain considerable financial requirements and surveillance to ensure the integrity of exchange traded futures and options. An option contract generally provides the option purchaser with the right but not the obligation to buy or sell during a period of time or at a specified date the underlying instrument at a set price. The option writer is obligated to sell or buy the underlying item if the option purchaser chooses to exercise his right. The option writer receives a nonrefundable fee or premium paid by the option purchaser. Options may be traded over the counter or on an exchange. Derivatives are generally either negotiated over the counter contracts or standardized contracts executed on an exchange. Standardized exchange traded derivatives include futures and options which can be readily bought or sold over recognized security or commodity exchanges and settled daily through such clearing houses. Negotiated over the counter derivatives include forwards, swaps and options. Over the counter derivatives are generally not traded like exchange traded securities and the terms of over the counter derivatives are non-standard and unique to each contract. However, in the normal course of business, with the agreement of the original counterparty, these contracts may be terminated early or assigned to another counterparty. All significant derivatives activities are conducted through AIGFP and AIGTG permitting AIG to participate in the derivatives dealer market acting primarily as principal. In these derivative operations, AIG structures agreements which generally allow its counterparties to enter into transactions with respect to changes in interest and exchange rates, securities' prices and certain commodities and financial or commodity indices. Generally, derivatives are used by AIG's customers such as corporations, financial institutions, multinational organizations, sovereign entities, government agencies and municipalities. For example, a futures, forward or option contract can be used to protect the customers' assets or liabilities against price fluctuations. A counterparty may default on any obligation to AIG, including a derivative contract. Credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and/or carrying trading and investment positions. Credit risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has an estimated positive fair value. To help manage this risk, the credit departments of AIGFP and AIGTG operate within the guidelines of the AIG Credit Risk Committee, which sets credit policy and limits for counterparties and provides limits for derivative transactions with counterparties having different credit ratings. In addition to credit ratings, this committee takes into account other factors, including the industry and country of the counterparty. Transactions which fall outside these pre-established guidelines require the approval of the AIG Credit Risk Committee. It is also AIG's policy to establish reserves for potential credit impairment when necessary. AIGFP and AIGTG determine the credit quality of each of their counterparties taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized statistical rating organizations. If it is determined that a counterparty requires credit enhancement, then one or more enhancement techniques will be used. Examples of such enhancement techniques include letters of credit, guarantees, collateral credit triggers and credit derivatives and margin agreements. A significant majority of AIGFP's transactions are contracted and documented under ISDA Master Agreements. Management believes that such agreements provide for legally enforceable set-off in the event of default. Also, under such agreements, in connection with a counterparty desiring to terminate a contract prior to maturity, AIGFP may be permitted to set-off its receivables from that counterparty against AIGFP's payables to that same counterparty arising out of all included transactions. Excluding regulated exchange transactions, AIGTG, whenever possible, enters into netting agreements with its counterparties which are similar in effect to those discussed above. The following tables provide the notional and contractual amounts of AIGFP's and AIGTG's derivatives transactions at December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999. The notional amounts used to express the extent of AIGFP's and AIGTG's involvement in swap transactions represent a standard of measurement of the volume of AIGFP's and AIGTG's swaps business. Notional amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and it may not necessarily be recorded on the balance sheet. Notional amounts represent those amounts used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received, except for certain contracts such as currency swaps. The timing and the amount of cash flows relating to AIGFP's and AIGTG's foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures and options contracts are determined by each of the respective contractual agreements. The net replacement value most closely represents the net credit risk to AIGFP or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss after the application of the aforementioned strategies, netting under ISDA Master Agreements and applying collateral held. Prior to the application of these credit enhancements, the gross credit risk with respect to these derivative instruments was $33.4 billion at December 31, 2000 and $16.90 billion at December 31, 1999. Subsequent to the application of such credit enhancements, the net exposure to credit risk or the net replacement value of all interest rate, currency and equity swaps, swaptions and forward commitments approximated $9.51 billion at December 31, 2000 and $7.53 billion at December 31, 1999.

At December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999, the counterparty credit quality and counterparty breakdown by industry with respect to the net replacement value of AIGTG\\'s derivatives portfolio were as follows:\\n*Exchange traded futures and options are not deemed to have significant credit exposure as the exchanges guarantee that every contract will be properly settled on a daily basis. Generally, AIG manages and operates its businesses in the currencies of the local operating environment. Thus, exchange gains or losses occur when AIG\\'s foreign currency net investment is affected by changes in the foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar from one reporting period to the next. AIG, through its Foreign Exchange Operating Committee, evaluates each of its worldwide consolidated foreign currency net asset or liability positions and manages AIG\\'s translation exposure to adverse movement in currency exchange rates. AIG may use forward exchange contracts and purchase options where the cost of such is reasonable and markets are liquid to reduce these exchange translation exposures. The exchange gain or loss with respect to these hedging instruments is recorded on an accrual basis as a component of comprehensive income in capital funds. As an end user, AIG and its subsidiaries, including its insurance subsidiaries, use derivatives to aid in managing AIG\\'s foreign exchange translation exposure. Derivatives may also be used to minimize certain exposures with respect to AIG\\'s debt financing and its insurance operations; to date, such activities have not been significant. AIG has formed a Derivatives Review Committee. This committee, with certain exceptions, provides an independent review of any proposed derivative transaction. The committee examines, among other things, the nature and purpose of the derivative transaction, its potential credit exposure, if any, and the estimated benefits. This committee does not review those derivative transactions entered into by AIGFP and AIGTG for their own accounts. Legal risk arises from the uncertainty of the enforceability, through legal or judicial processes, of the obligations of AIG\\'s clients and counterparties, including contractual provisions intended to reduce credit exposure by providing for the netting of mutual obligations. (See also the discussion on master netting agreements above.) AIG seeks to eliminate or minimize such uncertainty through continuous consultation with internal and external legal advisors, both domestically and abroad, in order to understand the nature of legal risk, to improve documentation and to strengthen transaction structure. Accounting Standards\\nIn June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 \"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\" (FASB 133). In June 2000, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138 \"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-an amendment of FASB Statement No.133\" (FASB 138). Together, these Statements require AIG to recognize all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The financial statement recognition of the change in the fair value of a derivative depends on a number of factors, including the intended use of the derivative and the extent to which it is effective as part of a hedge transaction. Due to the operating nature of AIGFP and AIGTG, the changes in fair value of their derivative transactions are currently presented, in all material respects, as a component of AIG\\'s operating income. FASB 133 and FASB 138 are effective for AIG for the year commencing January 1, 2001. AIG estimates that it will record in its first quarter of 2001 consolidated statement of income, in accordance with the transition provisions of FASB 133, a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment gain of $17 million. This gain represents the net fair value of all previously unrecorded derivative instruments as of January 1, 2001, net of taxes and after the application of hedge accounting. AIG also estimates that it will record in its first quarter of 2001 consolidated statement of comprehensive income, a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment loss of $211 million. The loss represents the reduction of other comprehensive income, net of taxes, arising from the fair value of all derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Recent Developments\\nOn November 22, 2000, AIG completed its acquisition of HSB Group, Inc. (HSB), which through its subsidiary, The Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company, provides equipment breakdown and other specialty insurance coverages. Each of the outstanding shares of HSB common stock was exchanged for 0.4178 of a share of AIG common stock resulting in the issuance of 12.2 million shares of AIG com-\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nmon stock.'),\n",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\n(a) Principles of Consolidation: On January 1, 1999 (the merger date), SunAmerica Inc., a Maryland corporation, merged with and into AIG. AIG issued 187.5 million shares of its common stock in exchange for all the outstanding common stock and Class B stock of SunAmerica Inc., based on an exchange ratio of 0.855 shares of AIG common stock for each share of SunAmerica Inc. stock. A newly formed Delaware company, SunAmerica Inc. (SunAmerica) holds substantially all of the assets previously held by the Maryland corporation. The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and the accompanying financial statements for 1998 have been restated to combine SunAmerica Inc.'s financial statements for its fiscal year ended September 30 with AIG's December 31 financial statements. The following is a reconciliation of the individual company results to the combined results for the 1998 twelve month period:\\nThe financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 1999, included in the AIG Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q reflected the operations of SunAmerica on a pooling of interests basis and the change of its fiscal year from September 30 to December 31. For the period October 1, 1998 through December 31, 1998, SunAmerica Inc.'s revenues were $318 million, operating income was $52 million and net income was $29 million; dividends distributed were $33 million. Thus, capital funds at December 31, 1999 reflect the net decrease in SunAmerica Inc.'s retained earnings of $4 million and the decline of $94 million in accumulated other comprehensive income. AIG subsidiaries write property, casualty, marine, life and financial lines insurance in approximately 130 countries and jurisdictions. Certain of AIG's foreign subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements report on a fiscal year ending November 30. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Commencing with the third quarter 1998, Transatlantic and 21st Century were consolidated into AIG's financial statements as AIG became the majority shareholder of these entities. (b) Basis of Presentation: The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\"),\n",

Acquisition costs represent those costs, including commissions, that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new business. These costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums written are earned. Investment income is not anticipated in the deferral of acquisition costs. (See Note 4.)\\nLosses and loss expenses are charged to income as incurred. The reserve for losses and loss expenses represents the accumulation of estimates for reported losses and includes provisions for losses incurred but not reported. The methods of determining such estimates and establishing resulting reserves, including amounts relating to reserves for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance, are continually reviewed and updated. Adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in income currently. AIG discounts certain of its loss reserves which are primarily related to certain workers' compensation claims. (See Note 6.)\\nLife Insurance Operations: AIG's life insurance subsidiaries offer a wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment products. Traditional products consist of individual and group life, annuity, endowment and accident and health policies. Financial and investment products consist of single premium annuity, variable annuities, guaranteed investment contracts, universal life and pensions. Premiums for traditional life insurance products and life contingent annuities, excluding accident and health products, are recognized as revenues when due. Estimates for premiums due but not yet collected are accrued. Benefits and expenses are provided against such revenues to recognize profits over the estimated life of the policies. Revenues for universal life and investment-type products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, administration and surrenders during the period. Expenses include interest credited to policy account balances and benefit payments made in excess of policy account balances. Accident and health products are accounted for in a manner similar to general insurance products described above. Investment income reflects certain amounts of realized capital gains where the gains are deemed to be an inherent element in pricing certain life products in some foreign countries. Policy acquisition costs for traditional life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period of the policy. Deferred policy acquisition costs and policy initiation costs related to universal life and investment-type products are amortized in relation to expected gross profits over the life of the policies.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\\nare deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts. Estimated gross profits are composed of net interest income, net realized investment gains and losses, variable annuity fees, surrender charges and direct administrative expenses. As debt and equity securities available for sale are carried at aggregate fair value, an adjustment is made to deferred policy acquisition costs equal to the change in amortization that would have been recorded if such securities had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields. The change in this adjustment, net of tax, is included with the change in net unrealized gains/losses on debt and equity securities available for sale that is credited or charged directly to comprehensive income. Deferred policy acquisition costs have been increased by $99 million at December 31, 2000 and increased by $130 million at December 31, 1999 for this adjustment. (See Note 4.)\\nThe liabilities for future policy benefits and policyholders' contract deposits are established using assumptions described in Note 6. Financial Services Operations: AIG participates in the derivatives dealer market conducting, primarily as principal, an interest rate, currency, equity and credit derivative products business. AIG also enters into structured transactions including long-dated forward foreign exchange contracts, option transactions, liquidity facilities and investment agreements and invests in a diversified portfolio of securities. AIG engages in market making and trading activities, as principal, in foreign exchange, interest rates and precious and base metals. AIG owns inventories in the commodities in which it trades and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the use of swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts. AIG, as lessor, leases flight equipment principally under operating leases. Accordingly, income is reported over the life of the lease as rentals become receivable under the provisions of the lease or, in the case of leases with varying payments, under the straight-line method over the noncancelable term of the lease. In certain cases, leases provide for additional amounts contingent on usage. AIG is also a remarketer of flight equipment for its own account and for airlines and financial institutions, and provides, for a fee, fleet management services to certain third-party operators. AIG's revenues from such operations consist of net gains on sales of flight equipment and commissions. Asset Management Operations: AIG's asset management operations offer a wide variety of investment vehicles and services, including variable annuities, mutual funds and investment asset management. Such products and services are offered to individuals and institutions both domestically and internationally. The fees generated with respect to asset management operations are recognized as revenues when earned. Costs incurred in the sale of variable annuities and mutual funds are deferred and subsequently amortized. With respect to variable annuities, acquisition costs are amortized in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the variable annuity contracts. With respect to the sale of mutual funds, acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the funds obtained. (c) Non-cash Transactions: During 2000, AIG issued 17.77 million common shares in connection with acquisitions. In July 1998, 224,950 shares of 21st Century's Series A preferred stock were converted into 19,584,368 shares of 21st Century's common stock. (d) Investments in Fixed Maturities and Equity Securities: Bonds and preferred stocks held to maturity, both of which are principally owned by the insurance subsidiaries, are carried at amortized cost where AIG has the ability and positive intent to hold these securities until maturity. Where AIG may not have the positive intent to hold these securities until maturity, those bonds are considered to be available for sale and carried at current market values. Interest income with respect to fixed maturity securities is accrued currently. Included in the bonds available for sale are collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). Premiums and discounts arising from the purchase of CMOs are treated as yield adjustments over their estimated lives. Bond trading securities are carried at current market values, as it is AIG's intention to sell these securities in the near term. Common and non-redeemable preferred stocks are carried at current market values. Dividend income is generally recognized when receivable. Unrealized gains and losses from investments in equity securities and fixed maturities available for sale are reflected as a separate component of comprehensive income, net of deferred income taxes in capital funds currently. Unrealized gains and losses from investments in trading securities are reflected in income currently. Realized capital gains and losses are determined principally by specific identification. Where declines in values of securities below cost or amortized cost are considered to be other than temporary, a charge is reflected in income for the difference between cost or amortized cost and estimated net realizable value. (e) Mortgage Loans on Real Estate, Policy and Collateral Loans-net: Mortgage loans on real estate, policy loans and collateral loans are carried at unpaid principal balances. Interest income on such loans is accrued currently. Impairment of mortgage loans on real estate and collateral loans is generally measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate subject to the fair value of underlying collateral. Interest income on such loans is recognized as cash is received. There is no allowance for policy loans, as these loans serve to reduce the death benefit paid when the death claim is made and the balances are effectively collateralized by the cash surrender value of the policy. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc.\"),\n",

Under the provisions of most leases for certain airframe and engine overhauls, the lessee is reimbursed for costs incurred up to but not exceeding contingent rentals paid to AIG by the lessee. AIG provides a charge to income for such reimbursements based upon the expected reimbursements during the life of the lease. Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line basis to a residual value of approximately 15 percent over the estimated useful lives of the related assets but not exceeding 25 years. AIG monitors the global aircraft market and the values of various types and models of aircraft within that market relative to the values of its own fleet. If events or circumstances were such that the carrying amount of AIG's aircraft might be impaired, AIG would determine if such impairment existed and recognize such impairment. This caption also includes deposits for aircraft to be purchased. At the time the assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the related accounts and the difference, net of proceeds, is recorded as a gain or loss. (g) Securities Available for Sale, at market value: These securities are held to meet long term investment objectives and are accounted for as available for sale, carried at current market values and recorded on a trade date basis. Unrealized gains and losses from valuing these securities and any related hedges are reflected in capital funds currently, net of any related deferred income taxes. When the underlying security is sold, the realized gain or loss resulting from the hedging derivative transaction is recognized in income in that same period as the realized gain or loss of the hedged security.

(i) Spot Commodities, at market value: Spot commodities are carried at current market values and are recorded on a settlement date basis. The exposure to market risk may be reduced through the use of forwards, futures and option contracts. Unrealized gains and losses of both commodities and any derivative transactions are reflected in income currently. (j) Unrealized Gain and Unrealized Loss on Interest Rate and Currency Swaps, Options and Forward Transactions: Interest rate swaps, currency swaps, equity swaps, swaptions, options and forward transactions are accounted for as contractual commitments recorded on a trade date basis and are carried at current market values or estimated fair values when market values are not available. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in income currently. Estimated fair values are based on the use of valuation models that utilize, among other things, current interest, foreign exchange and volatility rates. These valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows of these transactions and may include reserves for market risk as deemed appropriate. The portfolio's discounted cash flows are evaluated with reference to current market conditions, maturities within the portfolio and other relevant factors. Based upon this evaluation, it is determined what offsetting transactions, if any, are necessary to reduce the market risk of the portfolio. AIG manages its market risk with a variety of transactions, including swaps, trading securities, futures and forward contracts and other transactions as appropriate. Because of the limited liquidity of some of these instruments, the recorded values of these transactions may be different than the values that might be realized if AIG were to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes that such differences are not significant to the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Such differences would be immediately recognized when the transactions are sold or closed out prior to maturity. (k) Trading Assets and Trading Liabilities: Trading assets and trading liabilities include option premiums paid and received and receivables from and payables to counterparties which relate to unrealized gains and losses on futures, forwards and options and balances due from and due to clearing brokers and exchanges. Futures, forwards and options purchased and written are accounted for as contractual commitments on a trade date basis and are carried at fair values. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in income currently. The fair values of futures contracts are based on closing exchange quotations. Commodity forward transactions are carried at fair values derived from dealer quotations and underlying commodity exchange quotations. For long dated forward transactions, where there are no dealer or exchange quotations, fair values are derived using internally developed valuation methodologies based on available market information. Options are carried at fair values based on the use of valuation models that utilize, among other things, current interest or commodity rates and foreign exchange and volatility rates, as applicable. (l) Securities Purchased (Sold) Under Agreements to Resell (Repurchase), at contract value: Purchases of securities under agreements to resell and sales of securities under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized lending transactions and are recorded at their contracted resale or repurchase amounts, plus accrued interest. Generally, it is AIG's policy to take possession of or obtain a security interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell. AIG minimizes the credit risk that counterparties to transactions might be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations by monitoring customer credit exposure and collateral value and generally requiring additional collateral to be deposited with AIG when deemed necessary. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes to Financial Statements (CONTINUED)\\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\\n(m) Other Invested Assets: Other invested assets consist primarily of investments by AIG's insurance operations in joint ventures and partnerships and other investments not classified elsewhere herein.

It also includes funds held under reinsurance treaties. Amounts related to paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses with respect to these reinsurance agreements are substantially collateralized. (o) Investments in Partially-Owned Companies: The equity method of accounting is used for AIG's investment in companies in which AIG's ownership interest approximates twenty but is not greater than fifty percent (minority-owned companies). In years prior to 1999, equity in income of minority-owned insurance operations was presented separately in the consolidated statement of income. In 2000 and 1999, AIG did not report equity in income of minority-owned insurance operations as a result of the consolidation of the operations of Transatlantic and SELIC Holdings, Ltd. into general insurance operating results. IPC Holdings, Ltd., the remaining operation included in equity in income of minority-owned insurance operations in previous periods is now reported as a component of other income (deductions) -- net. Equity in net income of other unconsolidated companies is principally included in other income (deductions)-net. At December 31, 2000, AIG's significant investments in partially-owned companies included its 24.4 percent interest in IPC Holdings, Ltd. This balance sheet caption also includes investments in less significant partially-owned companies and in certain minor majority-owned subsidiaries. The amounts of dividends received from unconsolidated entities owned less than 50 percent were $3 million, $13 million and $24 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998 respectively. The undistributed earnings of unconsolidated entities owned less than 50 percent was $58 million as of December 31, 2000. (p) Real Estate and Other Fixed Assets: The costs of buildings and furniture and equipment are depreciated principally on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (maximum of 40 years for buildings and 10 years for furniture and equipment). Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred; expenditures for betterments are capitalized and depreciated. From time to time, AIG assesses the carrying value of its real estate relative to the market values of real estate within the specific local area. At December 31, 2000, there were no impairments. (q) Separate and Variable Accounts: Separate and variable accounts represent funds for which investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to the policyholders. Each account has specific investment objectives, and the assets are carried at market value. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims which arise out of any other business of AIG. (r) Securities and Spot Commodities Sold but not yet Purchased, at market value: Securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased represent sales of securities and spot commodities not owned at the time of sale. The obligations arising from such transactions are recorded on a trade date basis and carried at the respective current market values or current commodity prices.\"),\n",

In June 2000, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138 \"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133\" (FASB 138). Together, these Statements require AIG to recognize all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The financial statement recognition of the change in the fair value of a derivative depends on a number of factors, including the intended use of the derivative and the extent to which it is effective as part of a hedge transaction. Due to the operating nature of AIGFP and AIGTG, the changes in fair value of their derivative transactions are currently presented, in all material respects, as a component of AIG\\'s operating income. FASB 133 and FASB 138 are effective for AIG for the year commencing January 1, 2001.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs\\nThe following reflects the policy acquisition costs deferred for amortization against future income and the related amortization charged to income for general and life insurance operations, excluding certain amounts deferred and amortized in the same period:\\n5. Reinsurance\\nIn the ordinary course of business, AIG\\'s general and life insurance companies cede reinsurance to other insurance companies in order to provide greater diversification of AIG\\'s business and limit the potential for losses arising from large risks. General reinsurance is effected under reinsurance treaties and by negotiation on individual risks. Certain of these reinsurance arrangements consist of excess of loss contracts which protect AIG against losses over stipulated amounts. Ceded premiums are considered prepaid reinsurance premiums and are amortized into income over the contract period in proportion to the protection received. Amounts recoverable from general reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claims liabilities associated with the reinsurance and presented as a component of reinsurance assets. AIG life companies limit exposure to loss on any single life. For ordinary insurance, AIG retains a maximum of approximately one million dollars of coverage per individual life. There are smaller retentions for other lines of business. Life reinsurance is effected principally under yearly renewable term treaties. The premiums with respect to these treaties are considered prepaid reinsurance premiums and are amortized into income over the contract period in proportion to the protection provided. Amounts recoverable from life reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the assumptions used for the underlying policy benefits and are presented as a component of reinsurance assets. General insurance premiums written and earned were comprised of the following:\\nFor the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, reinsurance recoveries, which reduced loss and loss expenses incurred, amounted to $6.00 billion, $5.13 billion and $5.36 billion, respectively. Life insurance net premium income was comprised of the following:\\nLife insurance recoveries, which reduced death and other benefits, approximated $156 million, $168 million and $176 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998. AIG\\'s reinsurance arrangements do not relieve AIG from its direct obligation to its insureds. Thus, a credit exposure exists with respect to both general and life reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations assumed under the reinsurance agreements. AIG holds substantial collateral as security under related reinsurance agreements in the form of funds, securities and/or letters of credit. A provision has been recorded for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance. AIG has been largely successful in prior recovery efforts. AIG evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers through an internal reinsurance security committee consisting of members of AIG\\'s senior management. No single reinsurer is a material reinsurer to AIG nor is AIG\\'s business substantially dependent upon any reinsurance contract. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes to Financial Statements (CONTINUED)\\n5. Reinsurance (continued)\\nLife insurance ceded to other insurance companies was as follows:\\nLife insurance assumed represented 0.2 percent of gross life insurance in-force at December 31, 2000, 0.2 percent for 1999 and 0.3 percent for 1998 and life insurance premium income assumed represented 0.3 percent of gross premium income for each of the periods ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998.

Short duration contract liabilities are primarily accident and health products. The liability for future life policy benefits has been established based upon the following assumptions:\\n(i) Interest rates (exclusive of immediate/terminal funding annuities), which vary by territory, year of issuance and products, range from 1.5 percent to 12.0 percent within the first 20 years. Interest rates on immediate/terminal funding annuities are at a maximum of 12.2 percent and grade to not greater than 7.5 percent. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc.'),\n",

The weighted average lapse rate, including surrenders, for individual and group life approximated 8.1 percent. (iii) The portions of current and prior net income and of current unrealized appreciation of investments that can inure to the benefit of AIG are restricted in some cases by the insurance contracts and by the local insurance regulations of the countries in which the policies are in force. (iv) Participating life business represented approximately 31 percent of the gross insurance in-force at December 31, 2000 and 43 percent of gross premium income in 2000. The amount of annual dividends to be paid is determined locally by the Boards of Directors. Provisions for future dividend payments are computed by jurisdiction, reflecting local regulations. (d) The liability for policyholders' contract deposits has been established based on the following assumptions:\\n(i) Interest rates credited on deferred annuities, which vary by territory and year of issuance, range from 2.0 percent to 9.0 percent. Credited interest rate guarantees are generally for a period of one year. Withdrawal charges generally range from zero percent to 10.0 percent grading to zero over a period of zero to 10 years. (ii) Domestically, GICs have market value withdrawal provisions for any funds withdrawn other than benefit responsive payments. Interest rates credited generally range from 4.0 percent to 9.4 percent. The vast majority of these GICs mature within 10 years. Overseas, interest rates credited on GICs generally range from 4.8 percent to 7.3 percent and maturities range from 1 to 6 years. (iii) Interest rates on corporate life insurance products are guaranteed at 4.0 percent and the weighted average rate credited in 2000 was 6.8 percent. (iv) The universal life funds have credited interest rates of 4.5 percent to 7.5 percent and guarantees ranging from 4.0 percent to 5.5 percent depending on the year of issue. Additionally, universal life funds are subject to surrender charges that amount to 11.0 percent of the fund balance grading to zero over a period not longer than 20 years. (e) Certain products, which are short duration contracts, are subject to experience adjustments. These include group life and group medical products, credit life contracts, accident & health insurance contracts/riders attached to life policies and, to a limited extent, reinsurance agreements with other direct insurers. Ultimate premiums from these contracts are estimated and recognized as revenue and the unearned portions of the premiums are held as reserves. Experience adjustments vary according to the type of contract and the territory in which the policy is in force and are subject to local regulatory guidance. 7. Statutory Financial Data\\nStatutory surplus and net income for general insurance and life insurance operations as reported to regulatory authorities were as follows:\\n*Includes net realized capital gains and losses. AIG's insurance subsidiaries file financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by domestic or foreign insurance regulatory authorities. The differences between statutory financial statements and financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP vary between domestic and foreign jurisdictions. The principal differences are that statutory financial statements do not reflect deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred income taxes, all bonds are carried at amortized cost and reinsurance assets and liabilities are presented net of reinsurance. AIG's use of permitted statutory accounting practices does not have a significant impact on statutory surplus. 8. Investment Information\\n(a) Statutory Deposits: Cash and securities with carrying values of $5.37 billion and $4.34 billion were deposited by AIG's subsidiaries under requirements of regulatory authorities as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

An analysis of AIG's Medium Term Notes for the year ended December 31, 2000 was as follows:\\nThe interest rates on AIG's Medium Term Notes range from 0.50 percent to 7.15 percent. To the extent deemed appropriate, AIG may enter into swap transactions to reduce its effective borrowing rates with respect to these notes. At December 31, 2000, AIG's Medium Term Notes also included notes in aggregate principal amount of $196 million issued by SunAmerica Inc. with maturity dates from 2001 to 2026 at interest rates ranging from 6.03 percent to 7.34 percent. AIG does not intend to have SunAmerica issue its own debt. During 1997, AIG issued $100 million principal amount of equity-linked Medium Term Notes due July 30, 2004. These notes accrued interest at the rate of 2.25 percent and the total return on these notes was linked to the appreciation in market value of AIG's common stock. In conjunction with the issuance of these notes, AIG entered into a series of swap transactions which effectively converted its interest expense to a fixed rate of 5.87 percent and transferred the equity appreciation exposure to a third party. These notes were redeemed during 2000. During 2000, AIG issued $210 million principal amount of equity-linked Medium Term Notes due May 15, 2007. These notes accrue interest at the rate of 0.50 percent and the total return on these notes is linked to the appreciation in market value of AIG's common stock. The notes may be redeemed, at the option of AIG, as a whole but not in part, at any time on or after May 15, 2003. In conjunction with the issuance of these notes, AIG entered into a series of swap transactions which effectively converted its interest expense to a fixed rate of 7.17 percent and transferred the equity appreciation exposure to a third party.

These notes provide for a single principal payment at the maturity of each note. At December 31, 2000, the maturity schedule for ILFC's outstanding Medium Term Notes was as follows:\\n(d) Notes and Bonds Payable:\\n(i) Notes, Bonds and Debentures Issued by AIG. (A) Zero Coupon Notes: On October 1, 1984, AIG issued Eurodollar zero coupon notes in the aggregate principal amount at stated maturity of $750 million. The notes were offered at 12 percent of principal amount at stated maturity, bear no interest and are due August 15, 2004. The net proceeds to AIG from the issuance were $86 million. The notes are redeemable at any time in whole or in part at the option of AIG at 100 percent of their principal amount at stated maturity. The notes are also redeemable at the option of AIG or bearer notes may be redeemed at the option of the holder in the event of certain changes involving taxation in the United States at prices ranging from 65.26 percent currently, to 89.88 percent after August 15, 2003, of the principal amount at stated maturity together with accrued amortization of original issue discount from the preceding August 15. During 2000 and 1999, no notes were repurchased. At December 31, 2000, the notes outstanding after prior purchases had a face value of $189 million, an unamortized discount of $62 million and a net book value of $127 million. The amortization of the original issue discount was recorded as interest expense. (B) Italian Lire Bonds: In December, 1991, AIG issued unsecured bonds denominated in Italian Lire. The principal amount of 200 billion Italian Lire Bonds matures December 4, 2001 and accrues interest at a rate of 11.7 percent which is paid annually. These bonds are not redeemable prior to maturity, except in the event of certain changes involving taxation in the United States or the imposition of certain certification, identification or reporting requirements. Simultaneous with the issuance of this debt, AIG entered into a swap transaction which effectively converted AIG's net interest expense to a U.S. dollar liability of approximately 7.9 percent, which requires the payment of proceeds at maturity of approximately $159 million in exchange for 200 billion Italian Lire and interest thereon. (C) Notes and Debentures Issued by SunAmerica Inc.: As of December 31, 2000, Notes and Debentures issued by SunAmerica Inc. in aggregate principal amount of $433 million (net of amortized discount of $42 million) were outstanding with maturity dates from 2007 to 2097 at interest rates ranging from 5.60 percent to 9.95 percent.

Term notes in the aggregate principal amount of $350 million are at floating interest rates and the remainder are at fixed rates. These notes provide for a single principal payment at maturity. At December 31, 2000, the maturity schedule for ILFC's Term Notes was as follows:\\nAt December 31, 2000, ILFC had $75 million in aggregate principal amount of debt securities registered for issuance from time to time, which debt had been sold as of March 16, 2001. An additional $2.0 billion principal amount of debt securities was registered as of January 5, 2001, under which $800 million in notes were sold as of March 16, 2001. A $750 million Medium Term Note program was implemented on January 19, 2001 under which $200 million has been sold as of March 16, 2001. In addition, ILFC established a Euro Medium Term Note program for $2.0 billion, under which $771 million in notes were sold through December 31, 2000. ILFC has an Export Credit Facility up to a maximum of $4.3 billion, for approximately 75 aircraft to be delivered through 2001. ILFC has the right, but is not required, to use the facility to fund 85 percent of each aircraft's purchase price. This facility is guaranteed by various European Export Credit Agencies. The interest rate varies from 5.75 percent to 5.90 percent on the first 75 aircraft depending on the delivery date of the aircraft.

These Units were scheduled to mature on October 31, 1999. The holders of the Units received interest on the Treasury Notes payable by the United States Government at a rate of 7 1/2% per annum and Contract fees payable at a rate of 1% per annum (both, the \"Unit Payments\") based upon the stated amount. The Units provided that SunAmerica Inc. would deliver on October 31, 1999 to the holder of each Unit one and one-half shares of common stock of SunAmerica Inc., subject to adjustment under certain defined circumstances, and obligated the holder of the Unit to pay to SunAmerica Inc. $37.50 per Unit. The Treasury Notes were held by a collateral agent to secure payment to SunAmerica Inc. as required under the Contract, but could be redeemed by the holders of the Units under certain defined circumstances. SunAmerica Inc. redeemed all of its Units on December 6, 1998.

In addition, AIG guarantees various obligations of certain subsidiaries. (a) Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend subject to certain conditions. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses and typically require payment of a fee. These commitments approximated $500 million and $150 million for December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. AIG uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. AIG evaluates each counterparty's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by AIG upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes to Financial Statements (CONTINUED)\\n12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities (continued)\\n(b) AIG and certain of its subsidiaries become parties to financial instruments with market risk resulting from both dealer and end user activities and to reduce currency, interest rate, equity and commodity exposures. To the extent those instruments are carried at their estimated fair value, the elements of currency, interest rate, equity and commodity risks are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. In addition, these instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk not explicitly recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. Collateral is required, at the discretion of AIG, on certain transactions based on the creditworthiness of the counterparty. (c) AIGFP becomes a party to derivative financial instruments in the normal course of its business and to reduce its currency, interest rate and equity exposures. Interest rate, currency and equity risks related to such instruments are reflected in the consolidated financial statements to the extent these instruments are carried at a market or a fair value, whichever is appropriate. Because of limited liquidity of certain of these instruments, the recorded estimated fair values of such instruments may be different than the values that might be realized if AIGFP were to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIGFP, in the ordinary course of its operations and as principal, structures derivative transactions to meet the needs of investors who may be seeking to hedge certain aspects of such investors' operations. AIGFP may also enter into derivative transactions for its own account. Such derivative transactions include interest rate, currency and equity swaps, swaptions and forward commitments. Interest rate swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. AIGFP typically becomes a principal in the exchange of interest payments between the parties and, therefore, may be exposed to loss, if counterparties default. Currency and equity swaps are similar to interest rate swaps, but may involve the exchange of principal amounts at the beginning and end of the transaction. Swaptions are options where the holder has the right but not the obligation to enter into a swap transaction or cancel an existing swap transaction. At December 31, 2000, the notional principal amount of the sum of the swap pays and receives approximated $521.0 billion, primarily related to interest rate swaps of approximately $344.2 billion. The following tables provide the contractual and notional amounts of derivatives transactions of AIGFP and AIGTG at December 31, 2000. The notional amounts used to express the extent of involvement in swap transactions represent a standard of measurement of the volume of swaps business of AIGFP and AIGTG. Notional amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and it may not necessarily be recorded on the balance sheet. Notional amounts represent those amounts used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received, except for certain contracts such as currency swaps. The timing and the amount of cash flows relating to AIGFP's and AIGTG's foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures and options contracts are determined by each of the respective contractual agreements. The following table presents AIGFP's derivatives portfolio by maturity and type of derivative at December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999:\\nFutures and forward contracts are contracts for delivery of foreign currencies or financial indices in which the seller/purchaser agrees to make/take delivery at a specified future date of a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield. Risks arise as a result of movements in current market prices from contracted prices and the potential inability of counterparties to meet their obligations under the contracts. At December 31, 2000, the contractual amount of AIGFP's futures and forward contracts approximated $33.9 billion. The following table presents AIGFP's futures and forward contracts portfolio by maturity and type of derivative at December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999:\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\n12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities (continued)\\nThese instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk not explicitly recognized in the consolidated financial statements. AIGFP utilizes various credit enhancements, including collateral, credit triggers and credit derivatives to reduce the credit exposure relating to these off-balance sheet financial instruments. AIGFP requires credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties and the transaction's size and maturity. In addition, AIGFP's derivative transactions are generally documented under ISDA Master Agreements. Management believes that such agreements provide for legally enforceable set-off and close out netting of exposures to specific counterparties. Under such agreements, in connection with an early termination of a transaction, AIGFP is permitted to set off its receivables from a counterparty against its payables to the same counterparty arising out of all included transactions. As a result, the net replacement value represents the net sum of estimated positive fair values after the application of such strategies, agreements and collateral held. Prior to the application of the aforementioned credit enhancements, the gross exposure to credit risk with respect to these derivative instruments was $33.4 billion at December 31, 2000 and $16.90 billion at December 31, 1999. Subsequent to the application of such credit enhancements, the net exposure to credit risk or the net replacement value of all interest rate, currency, and equity swaps, swaptions and forward commitments approximated $9.51 billion at December 31, 2000 and $7.53 billion at December 31, 1999. The net replacement value for futures and forward contracts approximated $204 million at December 31, 2000 and $5 million at December 31, 1999. The net replacement value most closely represents the net credit risk to AIGFP or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss. AIGFP independently evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties, taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized statistical rating organizations. In addition, AIGFP's credit approval process involves pre-set counterparty, country and industry credit exposure limits and, for particularly credit intensive transactions, obtaining approval from AIG's Credit Risk Committee. The average credit rating of AIGFP's counterparties as a whole (as measured by AIGFP) is equivalent to AA. The maximum potential loss will increase or decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions. AIGFP determines counterparty credit quality by reference to ratings from independent rating agencies or internal analysis. At December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999, the counterparty credit quality by derivative product with respect to the net replacement value of AIGFP's derivatives portfolio was as follows:\\nAt December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999, the counterparty breakdown by industry with respect to the net replacement value of AIGFP's derivatives portfolio was as follows:\\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes to Financial Statements (CONTINUED)\\n12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities (continued)\\nSecurities sold, but not yet purchased represent obligations of AIGFP to deliver specified securities at their contracted prices, and thereby create a liability to repurchase the securities in the market at prevailing prices. AIGFP monitors and controls its risk exposure on a daily basis through financial, credit and legal reporting systems and, accordingly, believes that it has in place effective procedures for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which it is subject. Management is not aware of any potential counterparty defaults. Commissions, transaction and other fees for the twelve months ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 from AIGFP's operations were $1.06 billion, $737 million and $550 million, respectively. (d) AIGTG becomes a party to off-balance sheet financial instruments in the normal course of its business and to reduce its currency, interest rate and commodity exposures. Futures and forward contracts are contracts for delivery of foreign currencies, commodities or financial indices in which the seller/purchaser agrees to make/take delivery at a specified future date of a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield. Risks arise as a result of movements in current market prices from contracted prices and the potential inability of counterparties to meet their obligations under the contracts. Options are contracts that allow the holder of the option to purchase or sell the underlying commodity, currency or index at a specified price and within, or at, a specified period of time. Risks arise as a result of movements in current market prices from contracted prices, and the potential inability of the counterparties to meet their obligations under the contracts. As a writer of options, AIGTG generally receives an option premium and then manages the risk of any unfavorable change in the value of the underlying commodity, currency or index. At December 31, 2000, the contractual amount of AIGTG's futures, forward and option contracts approximated $461.0 billion. The gross replacement values presented represent the sum of the estimated positive fair values of all of AIGTG's derivatives contracts at December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999. These values do not represent the credit risk to AIGTG. Net replacement values presented represent the net sum of estimated positive fair values after the application of legally enforceable master closeout netting agreements and collateral held. The net replacement values most closely represent the net credit risk to AIGTG or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss within a product category. At December 31, 2000, the net replacement value of AIGTG's futures, forward and option contracts and interest rate and currency swaps approximated $4.1 billion. The following table provides the contractual and notional amounts and credit exposure, if applicable, by maturity and type of derivative of AIGTG's derivatives portfolio at December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999. In addition, the estimated positive fair values associated with the derivatives portfolio are also provided and include a maturity profile for the December 31, 2000 balances based upon the expected timing of the future cash flows. (a) Sold options obligate AIGTG to buy or sell the underlying item if the option purchaser chooses to exercise. The amounts do not represent credit exposure. (b) The net replacement values with respect to exchange traded futures and options, forward contracts and purchased over the counter options are presented as a component of trading assets in the accompanying balance sheet.

Spot commodities sold but not yet purchased represent obligations of AIGTG to deliver spot commodities at their contracted prices and thereby create a liability to repurchase the spot commodities in the market at prevailing prices. AIGTG limits its risks by holding offsetting positions. In addition, AIGTG monitors and controls its risk exposures through various monitoring systems which evaluate AIGTG\\'s market and credit risks, and through credit approvals and limits. At December 31, 2000, AIGTG did not have a significant concentration of credit risk from either an individual counterparty or group of counterparties. Commissions, transaction and other fees for the twelve months ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 from AIGTG\\'s operations were $254 million, $227 million and $374 million, respectively. At December 31, 2000, AIGTG had issued and outstanding a $28 million principal amount letter of credit. This letter of credit was issued to a central bank. AIG has issued unconditional guarantees with respect to the prompt payment, when due, of all present and future obligations and liabilities of AIGFP and AIGTG arising from transactions entered into by AIGFP and AIGTG. (e) As a component of its asset and liability management strategy, SunAmerica utilizes swap agreements to match more closely the cash flows of its assets to the cash flows of its liabilities. SunAmerica uses these swap agreements to hedge against the risk of interest rate changes. At December 31, 2000, SunAmerica\\'s swap agreements had an aggregate notional principal amount of $12.25 billion. These agreements mature in various years through 2030. For investment purposes, SunAmerica has entered into various total return agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $28 million (the \"notional amount\") at December 31, 2000. The total return agreements effectively exchange a fixed rate of interest (the \"payment amount\") on the notional amount for the coupon income plus or minus the increase or decrease in the fair value of specified non-investment grade bonds (the \"bonds\"). SunAmerica is exposed to potential loss with respect to credit risk on the underlying non-investment grade bonds and fair value risk resulting from the payment amount and any depreciation in the aggregate fair value of the bonds below the notional amount. SunAmerica is also exposed to potential credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the investment grade rated counterparty with respect to any increase in the aggregate market value of the bonds above the notional amount.

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities (continued)\\nAIG continues to receive claims asserting injuries from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites (hereinafter collectively referred to as environmental claims) and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a difficult process, as these claims, which emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years, cannot be estimated by conventional reserving techniques. Asbestos and environmental claims development is affected by factors such as inconsistent court resolutions, the broadening of the intent of policies and scope of coverage and increasing number of new claims. AIG and other industry members have and will continue to litigate the broadening judicial interpretation of policy coverage and the liability issues. If the courts continue in the future to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage, as they have in the past, additional liabilities would emerge for amounts in excess of reserves held. This emergence cannot now be reasonably estimated, but could have a material impact on AIG's future operating results. The reserves carried for these claims as at December 31, 2000 ($2.45 billion gross; $855 million net) are believed to be adequate as these reserves are based on known facts and current law. A summary of reserve activity, including estimates for applicable incurred but not reported losses and loss expenses, relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined at December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 follows. (h) Risk Based Capital (RBC) is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. Thus, inadequately capitalized general and life insurance companies may be identified. The RBC formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. Higher factors are applied to more risky items and lower factors are applied to less risky items. Thus, the target level of statutory surplus varies not only as a result of the insurer's size, but also on the risk profile of the insurer's operations. The RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control. The statutory surplus of each of AIG's domestic general and life insurance subsidiaries exceeded their RBC standards by considerable margins as of December 31, 2000. To the extent that any of AIG's insurance entities would fall below prescribed levels of surplus, it would be AIG's intention to infuse necessary capital to support that entity. (i) SunAmerica has established a deferred compensation plan for its registered representatives, pursuant to which participants have the opportunity to invest deferred commissions and fees on a notional basis. The value of the deferred compensation fluctuates with the value of the deferred investment alternatives chosen. AIG has provided a full and unconditional guarantee of the obligations of SunAmerica to pay the deferred compensation under the plan. 13.\"),\n",

Fair Value of Financial Instruments (continued)\\nThe following methods and assumptions were used by AIG in estimating the fair value of the financial instruments presented:\\nCash and short-term investments: The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for these instruments approximate fair values. Fixed maturity securities: Fair values for fixed maturity securities carried at amortized cost or at market value were generally based upon quoted market prices. For certain fixed maturity securities for which market prices were not readily available, fair values were estimated using values obtained from independent pricing services. No other fair valuation techniques were applied to these securities as AIG believes it would have to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived. Equity securities: Fair values for equity securities were based upon quoted market prices. Mortgage loans on real estate, policy and collateral loans: Where practical, the fair values of loans on real estate and collateral loans were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based upon AIG's current incremental lending rates for similar type loans. The fair values of the policy loans were not calculated as AIG believes it would have to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived. Trading assets and trading liabilities: Fair values for trading assets and trading liabilities approximate the carrying values presented in the consolidated balance sheet. Securities available for sale: Fair values for securities available for sale and related hedges were based on quoted market prices. For securities and related hedges for which market prices were not readily available, fair values were estimated using quoted market prices of comparable investments. Trading securities: Fair values for trading securities were based on current market value where available. For securities for which market values were not readily available, fair values were estimated using quoted market prices of comparable investments. Spot commodities: Fair values for spot commodities were based on current market prices. Unrealized gains and losses on interest rate and currency swaps, options and forward transactions: Fair values for swaps, options and forward transactions were based on the use of valuation models that utilize, among other things, current interest, foreign exchange and volatility rates, as applicable. Securities purchased (sold) under agreements to resell (repurchase), at contract value: As these securities (obligations) are short-term in nature, the contract values approximate fair values. Other invested assets: For assets for which market prices were not readily available, fair valuation techniques were not applied as AIG believes it would have to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived. Policyholders' contract deposits: Fair values of policyholder contract deposits were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based upon interest rates currently being offered for similar contracts with maturities consistent with those remaining for the contracts being valued. GIAs: Fair values of AIG's obligations under investment type agreements were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based on interest rates currently being offered for similar agreements with maturities consistent with those remaining for the agreements being valued. Additionally, AIG follows a policy of minimizing interest rate risks associated with GIAs by entering into swap transactions. Securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased: The carrying amounts for the financial instruments approximate fair values. Fair values for spot commodities sold short were based on current market prices. Trust deposits and deposits due to banks and other depositors: To the extent certain amounts are not demand deposits or certificates of deposit which mature in more than one year, fair values were not calculated as AIG believes it would have to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived. Commercial paper: The carrying amount of AIG's commercial paper borrowings approximates fair value. Notes, bonds, loans and mortgages payable: Where practical, the fair values of these obligations were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based upon AIG's current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowings with maturities consistent with those remaining for the debt being valued. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes to Financial Statements (CONTINUED)\\n13. Fair Value of Financial Instruments (continued)\\nThe carrying values and fair values of AIG's financial instruments at December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999 and the average fair values with respect to derivative positions during 2000 and 1999 were as follows: (in millions)\\nOff-balance sheet financial instruments: Financial instruments which are not currently recognized in the consolidated balance sheet of AIG are principally commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees.

Stock Compensation Plans (continued)\\n(i) Stock Option Plan: On September 15, 1999, the AIG Board of Directors adopted a 1999 stock option plan (the 1999 Plan), which provides that options to purchase a maximum of 15,000,000 shares of common stock can be granted to certain key employees and members of the Board of Directors at prices not less than fair market value at the date of grant. The 1999 Plan limits the maximum number of shares as to which stock options may be granted to any employee in any one year to 375,000 shares. Options granted under this Plan expire not more than 10 years from the date of the grant. Options with respect to 13,500 shares and 12,000 shares were granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors on September 15, 1999 and May 17, 2000, respectively. These options become exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant, expire 10 years from the date of grant and do not qualify for Incentive Stock Option Treatment under the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ISO Treatment). The Plan, and the options previously granted thereunder, were approved by the shareholders at the 2000 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. At December 31, 2000, 12,842,155 shares were reserved for future grants under the 1999 Plan. The 1999 Plan superceded the 1991 employee stock option plan (the 1991 Plan) and the previously superceded 1987 employee stock option plan (the 1987 Plan), although outstanding options granted under both the 1991 Plan and the 1987 Plan continue in force until exercise or expiration. At December 31, 2000, there were 15,991,621 shares reserved for issuance under the 1999, 1991, and 1987 Plans. During 2000 and 1999, AIG granted options with respect to 413,500 shares and 574,500 shares, respectively, which become exercisable on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant and expire 10 years from the date of grant. These options do not qualify for ISO Treatment. The agreements with respect to all other options granted to employees under these plans provide that 25 percent of the options granted become exercisable on the anniversary of the date of grant in each of the four years following that grant and expire 10 years from the date of the grant. As of December 31, 2000, outstanding options granted with respect to 8,875,310 shares qualified for ISO Treatment. At January 1, 1999, the merger date, SunAmerica Inc. had five stock-based compensation plans pursuant to which options, restricted stock and deferred share and share unit obligations had been issued and remained outstanding. Options granted under these plans had an exercise price equal to the market price on the date of grant, had a maximum term of ten years and generally became exercisable ratably over a five-year period. Substantially all of the SunAmerica Inc. options outstanding at the merger date became fully vested on that date and were converted into options to purchase AIG common stock at the exchange ratio of 0.855 shares of AIG common stock for each share of SunAmerica Inc. common stock. No further options can be granted under the SunAmerica Inc. plans, but outstanding options so converted continue in force until exercise or expiration. At December 31, 2000, there were 20,574,062 shares of AIG common stock reserved for issuance on exercise of options under these plans. None of these options qualified for ISO Treatment as of December 31, 2000. During 1999, AIG issued 1,009,968 shares of AIG common stock which vested on the effectiveness of the merger with SunAmerica Inc., and an additional 993,031 shares were issued pursuant to deferred share and share unit obligations. During 2000, deferred share and share unit obligations with respect to an additional 1,224,214 shares of AIG common stock vested, 142,105 shares were issued pursuant to deferred share and share unit obligations and an additional 1,082,109 shares were delivered into a trust in connection with a deferred compensation plan. No additional deferred share or share unit obligations may be granted under the SunAmerica plans. As of December 31, 2000, deferred share and share unit obligations representing 173,615 shares were outstanding but not yet vested. In 1999, the AIG Board of Directors amended the AIG stock option plans to allow deferral of delivery of AIG shares otherwise deliverable upon the exercise of an option to a date or dates specified by the optionee upon the request of an optionee. During 2000, options with respect to 760,070 shares were exercised with delivery deferred. At December 31, 2000, optionees had made valid elections to defer delivery of 858,703 shares of AIG common stock upon exercise of options expiring during 2001. As a result of the acquisition of HSB Group, Inc. (HSB) in November 2000, HSB options outstanding at the acquisition date were fully vested and were converted into options to purchase AIG common stock at the exchange ratio of 0.4178 shares of AIG common stock for each share of HSB common stock. No further options can be granted under the HSB option plans, but outstanding options so converted continue in force until exercise or expiration. At December 31, 2000, there were 1,605,468 shares of AIG common stock reserved for issuance under the HSB option plans, none of which qualified for ISO Treatment. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes to Financial Statements (CONTINUED)\\n14.

In addition, at December 31, 2000, options to purchase 403,595 shares at a weighted average exercise price of $19.81 had been previously granted to AIG non-employee directors and remained outstanding. Information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 2000, is summarized as follows:\\nThe fair values of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 were $85 million, $71 million and $28 million, respectively. The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions were used for grants in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively: dividend yields of 0.17 percent, 0.20 percent and 0.24 percent; expected volatilities of 27.0 percent, 25.0 percent and 22.0 percent; risk-free interest rates of 5.42 percent, 5.33 percent and 4.73 percent and expected terms of 7 years. Using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model applicable to SunAmerica Inc. for 1998, the fair value of stock options granted by SunAmerica Inc. was $49 million. (ii) Employee Stock Purchase Plan: AIG's 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan was adopted at its 1996 shareholders' meeting and became effective as of July 1, 1996. Eligible employees may receive privileges to purchase up to an aggregate of 4,218,750 shares of AIG common stock, at a price equal to 85 percent of the fair market value on the date of the grant of the purchase privilege. Purchase privileges are granted annually and were originally limited to the number of whole shares that could be purchased by an amount equal to 5 percent of an employee's annual salary or $5,500, whichever was less. Beginning with the January 1, 1998 subscription, the maximum allowable purchase limitation increased to 10 percent of an employee's annual salary or $10,000 per year, whichever is less, and the eligibility requirement was reduced from two years to one year. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- American International Group, Inc.\"),\n",

Employee Benefits\\n(a) Employees of AIG, its subsidiaries and certain affiliated companies, including employees in foreign countries, are generally covered under various funded and insured pension plans. Eligibility for participation in the various plans is based on either completion of a specified period of continuous service or date of hire, subject to age limitation. AIG\\'s U.S. retirement plan is a qualified, noncontributory, defined benefit plan. All qualified employees, other than those of SunAmerica, 21st Century and HSB Group, Inc. who have attained age 21 and completed twelve months of continuous service are eligible to participate in this plan. An employee with 5 or more years of service is entitled to pension benefits beginning at normal retirement at age 65. Benefits are based upon a percentage of average final compensation multiplied by years of credited service limited to 44 years of credited service. The average final compensation is subject to certain limitations. Annual funding requirements are determined based on the \"projected unit credit\" cost method which attributes a pro rata portion of the total projected benefit payable at normal retirement to each year of credited service. AIG has adopted a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (Supplemental Plan) to provide additional retirement benefits to designated executives and key employees. Under the Supplemental Plan, the annual benefit, not to exceed 60 percent of average final compensation, accrues at a percentage of average final pay multiplied for each year of credited service reduced by any benefits from the current and any predecessor retirement plans, Social Security, if any, and from any qualified pension plan of prior employers. The Supplemental Plan also provides a benefit equal to the reduction in benefits payable under the AIG retirement plan as a result of Federal limitations on benefits payable thereunder. Currently, the Supplemental Plan is unfunded. Eligibility for participation in the various non-U.S. retirement plans is either based on completion of a specified period of continuous service or date of hire, subject to age limitation. Where non-U.S. retirement plans are defined benefit plans, they are generally based on the employees\\' years of credited service and average compensation in the years preceding retirement. In addition to AIG\\'s defined benefit pension plan, AIG and its subsidiaries provide a postretirement benefit program for medical care and life insurance, domestically and in certain foreign countries. Eligibility in the various plans is generally based upon completion of a specified period of eligible service and reaching a specified age. Benefits vary by geographic location. AIG\\'s U.S. postretirement medical and life insurance benefits are based upon the employee electing immediate retirement and having a minimum of ten years of service. Retirees and their dependents who were age 65 by May 1, 1989 participate in the medical plan at no cost. Employees who retired after May 1, 1989 and on or prior to January 1, 1993 pay the active employee premium if under age 65 and 50 percent of the active employee premium if over age 65. Retiree contributions are subject to adjustment annually. Other cost sharing features of the medical plan include deductibles, coinsurance and Medicare coordination and a lifetime maximum benefit of $1.5 million. The lifetime maximum benefit of the medical plan was increased to $2.0 million effective January 1, 2000. The maximum life insurance benefit prior to age 70 is $32,500, with a maximum of $25,000 thereafter. Effective January 1, 1993, both plans\\' provisions were amended. Employees who retire after January 1, 1993 are required to pay the actual cost of the medical benefits premium reduced by a credit which is based on years of service at retirement. The life insurance benefit varies by age at retirement from $5,000 for retirement at ages 55 through 59; $10,000 for retirement at ages 60 through 64 and $15,000 for retirement at ages 65 and over. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes to Financial Statements (CONTINUED)\\n15.

There are no significant receivables from/payables to related parties at December 31, 2000. Net commission payments to Starr aggregated approximately $60 million in 2000, $45 million in 1999 and $46 million in 1998, from which Starr is required to pay commissions due originating brokers and its operating expenses. AIG also received approximately $13 million in 2000, $11 million in 1999 and $13 million in 1998 from Starr and paid approximately $41,000 in 2000, $42,000 in 1999 and $37,000 in 1998 to Starr in rental fees. AIG also received approximately $1 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998 from SICO and paid approximately $1 million in each of the years 2000, 1999 and 1998 to SICO as reimbursement for services rendered at cost. AIG also paid to SICO $4 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998 in rental fees. 18. Segment Information\\n(a) AIG's operations are conducted principally through four business segments. These segments and their respective operations are as follows:\\nGeneral Insurance: AIG's general insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance. DBG writes substantially all classes of business insurance accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers. This provides DBG the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to submit business to DBG without the traditional agent-company contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no authority to commit DBG to accept a risk. Transatlantic's and HSB's domestic operations are included in this group. AIG's Foreign General insurance group accepts risks primarily underwritten through AIU, a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned agencies and insurance entities. The Foreign General insurance group also includes business written by AIG's foreign-based insurance subsidiaries for their own accounts. The Foreign General group uses various marketing methods to write both business and personal lines insurance with certain refinements for local laws, customs and needs. AIU operates in over 70 countries in Asia, the Pacific Rim, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America. Transatlantic's foreign operations are included in this group. Life Insurance: AIG's life insurance subsidiaries offer a wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment products. Traditional products consist of individual and group life, annuity, endowment and accident and health policies. Financial and investment products consist of single premium annuity, variable annuities, guaranteed investment contracts, universal life and pensions. AIG's three principal overseas life operations are ALICO, AIA and Nan Shan. ALICO is incorporated in Delaware and all of its business is written outside of the United States. ALICO has operations either directly or through subsidiaries in approximately 50 countries located in Europe, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and the Far East, with Japan being the largest territory. AIA operates primarily in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. Nan Shan operates in Taiwan. AIG's domestic life operations are comprised of two separate operations, AIG's domestic life companies and the life insurance subsidiaries of SunAmerica. Both of these operations sell primarily financial and investment type products. Financial Services: AIG's financial services subsidiaries engage in diversified financial products and services including premium financing, banking services and consumer finance services. ILFC engages primarily in the acquisition of new and used commercial jet aircraft and the leasing and remarketing of such aircraft to airlines around the world. AIGFP structures financial transactions, including long-dated interest rate and currency swaps and structured borrowings through notes, bonds and guaranteed investment agreements. AIGTG engages in various commodities trading, foreign exchange trading, interest rate swaps and market making activities. Asset Management: AIG's asset management operations offer a wide variety of investment vehicles and services, including variable annuities, mutual funds and investment asset management. Such products and services are offered to individuals and institutions both domestically and internationally. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes to Financial Statements (CONTINUED)\\n18. Segment Information (continued)\\nAIG's three principal asset management operations are SAAMCo, Global Investment and Cap Partners. SAAMCo develops and sells variable annuities and other investment products, sells and manages mutual funds and provides financial services. Global Investment manages third-party institutional, retail and private equity funds invested assets on a global basis, and provides custodial services. Cap Partners organizes, and manages the invested assets of institutional investment funds and may also invest in such funds. Each of these subsidiary operations receives fees for investment products and services provided.

(See also Note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\n* Includes $769 million and $131 million in WTC losses for general and life insurance operations, respectively. GENERAL INSURANCE OPERATIONS\\nAIG\\'s general insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance. One or more of these companies is licensed to write substantially all of these lines in all states of the United States and in approximately 70 foreign countries. Domestic general insurance operations are comprised of the Domestic Brokerage Group (DBG), which includes the operations of HSB; Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (\"Transatlantic\"); Personal Lines, including 21st Century Insurance Group (\"21st Century\"), and Mortgage Guaranty. AIG\\'s primary domestic division is DBG. DBG\\'s business is derived from brokers in the United States and Canada and is conducted through its general insurance subsidiaries including American Home, National Union, Lexington and certain other insurance company subsidiaries of AIG. The risk management division of DBG provides insurance and risk management programs for large corporate customers. The AIG Risk Finance division designs and implements risk financing alternatives using the insurance and financial services capabilities of AIG. Also included are the operations of AIG Environmental which focuses specifically on providing specialty products to clients with environmental exposures. DBG writes substantially all classes of business insurance accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers. This provides DBG the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to submit business to DBG without the traditional agent-company contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no authority to commit DBG to accept a risk. In addition to writing substantially all classes of business insurance, including large commercial or industrial property insurance, excess liability, inland marine, environmental, workers\\' compensation and excess and umbrella coverages, DBG offers many specialized forms of insurance such as equipment breakdown, directors and officers liability, difference-in-conditions, kidnap-ransom, export credit and political risk, and various types of professional errors and omissions coverages. Lexington writes surplus lines, those risks for which conventional insurance companies do not readily provide insurance coverage, either because of complexity or because the coverage does not lend itself to conventional contracts. Transatlantic offers reinsurance capacity on both treaty and facultative bases. Transatlantic structures traditional and non-traditional programs for a full range of property and casualty products with an emphasis on specialty risk. AIG engages in mass marketing of personal lines coverages, primarily private passenger auto and homeowners and personal umbrella coverages, principally through American International Insurance Company and 21st Century. The business of United Guaranty Corporation (\"UGC\") and its subsidiaries is also included in the domestic operations of AIG. The principal business of the UGC subsidiaries is the writing of residential mortgage loan insurance, which is guaranty insurance on conventional first mortgage loans on single-family dwellings and condominiums. Such insurance protects lenders against loss if borrowers default. UGC subsidiaries also write home equity and property improvement loan insurance on loans to finance residential property improvements, alterations and repairs and for other purposes not necessarily related to real estate. UGC had approximately $22 billion of mortgage guarantee risk in-force at December 31, 2001. AIG\\'s Foreign General insurance group accepts risks primarily underwritten through American International Underwriters (\"AIU\"), a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned agencies and insurance companies. The Foreign General insurance group also includes business written by AIG\\'s foreign-based insurance subsidiaries for their own accounts. The Foreign General group uses various marketing methods to write both business and personal lines insurance with certain refinements for local laws, customs and needs. AIU operates in over 70 countries in Asia, the Pacific Rim, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America. During 2001, DBG and the Foreign General insurance group accounted for 50.7 percent and 25.1 percent, respectively, of AIG\\'s net premiums written. AIG\\'s general insurance company subsidiaries worldwide operate primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account and securing reinsurance on that portion of the risk in excess of the limit which they wish to retain. This operating policy differs from that of many insurance companies which will underwrite only up to their net retention limit, thereby requiring the broker or agent to secure commitments from other underwriters for the remainder of the gross risk amount. The following table summarizes general insurance premiums written and earned:\\nThe utilization of reinsurance is closely monitored by an internal reinsurance security committee, consisting of members of AIG\\'s senior management. No single reinsurer is a material reinsurer to AIG nor is AIG\\'s business substantially dependent upon any reinsurance contract. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG is diversified both in terms of lines of business and geographic locations. Of the general insurance lines of business, workers\\' compensation was approximately 9 percent of AIG\\'s net premiums written. This line is also diversified geographically. The majority of AIG\\'s general insurance business is in the casualty classes, which tend to involve longer periods of time for the reporting and settling of claims. This may increase the risk and uncertainty with respect to AIG\\'s loss reserve development. (See also the Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development and Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nLoss and expense ratios of AIG\\'s consolidated general insurance operations are set forth in the following table. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\n(a) Excluding WTC losses, the general insurance combined ratio would have been 96.7. (b) Source: Best\\'s Aggregates & Averages (Stock insurance companies, after dividends to policyholders): the ratio for 2001 was obtained from Fox-Pitt, Kelton Inc. and reflects estimated results. During 2001, of the direct general insurance premiums written (gross premiums less return premiums and cancellations, excluding reinsurance assumed and before deducting reinsurance ceded), 10.3 percent and 6.3 percent were written in California and New York respectively. No other state accounted for more than 5 percent of such premiums. There was no significant adverse effect on AIG\\'s general insurance results of operations from the economic environments in any one state, country or geographic region for the year ended December 31, 2001. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nDISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED NET LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT\\nThe reserve for net losses and loss expenses represents the accumulation of estimates for reported losses (\"case basis reserves\") and provisions for losses incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\"), both reduced by applicable reinsurance recoverable. Losses and loss expenses are charged to income as incurred. AIG discounts certain of its loss reserves principally related to workers\\' compensation lines of business. Loss reserves established with respect to foreign business are set and monitored in terms of the respective local or functional currency. Therefore, no assumption is included for changes in currency rates. (See also Note 1(u) of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nManagement continually reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves through the utilization of a number of analytical reserve development techniques. Through the use of these techniques, management is able to monitor the adequacy of its established reserves and determine appropriate assumptions for inflation. Also, analysis of emerging specific development patterns, such as case reserve redundancies or deficiencies and IBNR emergence, allows management to currently determine any required adjustments. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nThe \"Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development\", which follows, presents the development of net losses and loss expense reserves for calendar years 1991 through 2001. The upper half of the table shows the cumulative amounts paid during successive years related to the opening loss reserves. For example, with respect to the net losses and loss expense reserve of $18.42 billion as of December 31, 1994, by the end of 2001 (seven years later) $15.21 billion had actually been paid in settlement of these net loss reserves. In addition, as reflected in the lower section of the table, the original reserve of $18.42 billion was reestimated to be $18.28 billion at December 31, 2001. This decrease from the original estimate would generally be a combination of a number of factors, including reserves being settled for smaller amounts than originally estimated.'),\n",

The redundancy (deficiency) depicted in the table, for any particular calendar year, shows the aggregate change in estimates over the period of years subsequent to the calendar year reflected at the top of the respective column heading. For example, the deficiency of $447 million at December 31, 2001 related to December 31, 2000 net losses and loss expense reserves of $24.95 billion represents the cumulative amount by which reserves for 2000 and prior years have developed deficiently during 2001. This modest deficiency that has emerged in the last year can be attributed principally to a series of excessive jury awards in certain liability or casualty lines of business.'),\n",

Reserve development for these operations is included only for 1998 and subsequent periods. ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED NET LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT\\nThe following table excludes for each calendar year the net loss and loss expense reserves and the development thereof with respect to asbestos and environmental claims. Thus, AIG\\'s loss and loss expense reserves excluding asbestos and environmental claims are developing adequately.

(b) Does not include the effects of foreign exchange adjustments which are reflected in the \"Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development\" table. (c) See also Note 6(a) of Notes to Financial Statements. Approximately 50 percent of the net losses and loss expense reserves are paid out within two years of the date incurred. The remaining net losses and loss expense reserves, particularly those associated with the casualty lines of business, may extend to 20 years or more. For further discussion regarding net reserves for losses and loss expenses, see Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The reserve for losses and loss expenses as reported in AIG\\'s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2001, differs from the total reserve reported in the Annual Statements filed with state insurance departments and, where appropriate, with foreign regulatory authorities. The differences at December 31, 2001 relate primarily to reserves for certain foreign operations. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nThe reserve for gross losses and loss expenses is prior to reinsurance and represents the accumulation for reported losses and IBNR. Management reviews the adequacy of established gross loss reserves in the manner previously described for net loss reserves. The \"Analysis of Consolidated Gross Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development\" table, which follows, presents the development of gross losses and loss expense reserves for calendar years 1992 through 2001. ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED GROSS LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT\\nLIFE INSURANCE OPERATIONS\\nAIG\\'s life insurance subsidiaries offer a wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment products. One or more of these subsidiaries is licensed to write life insurance in all states in the United States and in over 70 foreign countries. Traditional products consist of individual and group life, annuity, endowment and accident and health policies. Financial and investment products consist of single premium annuity, variable annuities, guaranteed investment contracts, universal life and pensions. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nLife insurance operations in foreign countries comprised 74.3 percent of life premium income and 52.1 percent of operating income in 2001. AIG operates overseas principally through ALICO, AIA and Nan Shan. ALICO is incorporated in Delaware and all of its business is written outside of the United States. ALICO has operations either directly or through subsidiaries in approximately 50 countries located in Europe, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and the Far East, with Japan being the largest territory. AIG added significantly to its presence in Japan with the acquisition of AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd. in 2001, as a result of the reorganization of Chiyoda Mutual Life Insurance Company. AIA operates primarily in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. Nan Shan operates in Taiwan. (See also Note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG\\'s principal domestic life insurance subsidiaries include American General Life, AIG Annuity and SunAmerica Life. These companies utilize multiple distribution channels including brokerage and career and general agents to offer traditional life products as well as financial and investment products. The domestic life operations comprised 25.7 percent of total life premium income in 2001. There was no significant adverse effect on AIG\\'s life insurance results of operations from economic environments in any one state, country or geographic region for the year ended December 31, 2001. (See also Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nTraditional life insurance products such as whole life and endowment continue to be significant in the overseas compa-\\nnies, especially in Southeast Asia, while a mixture of traditional, accident and health and financial products are sold in Japan. In addition to the above, AIG also has subsidiary operations in the Philippines, Canada, Mexico, Poland, Switzerland, Puerto Rico, and conducts life insurance business through AIUO subsidiary companies in Russia, Israel and in certain countries in Central and South America. The foreign life companies have over 175,000 career agents and sell their products largely to indigenous persons in local currencies. In addition to the agency outlets, these companies also distribute their products through direct marketing channels, such as mass marketing, and through brokers and other distribution outlets such as financial institutions.

ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS\\nAIG holds a 24.4 percent interest in IPC Holdings, Ltd., a reinsurance holding company and a 23.4 percent interest in Allied World Assurance Holdings, Ltd., a property-casualty insurance holding company. (See also Note 1(p) of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nLOCATIONS OF CERTAIN ASSETS\\nAs of December 31, 2001, approximately 26 percent of the consolidated assets of AIG were located in foreign countries (other than Canada), including $1.08 billion of cash and securities on deposit with foreign regulatory authorities. Foreign operations and assets held abroad may be adversely affected by political developments in foreign countries, including such possibilities as tax changes, nationalization and changes in regulatory policy, as well as by consequence of hostilities and unrest. The risks of such occurrences and their overall effect\\nupon AIG vary from country to country and cannot easily be predicted. If expropriation or nationalization does occur, AIG's policy is to take all appropriate measures to seek recovery of such assets. Certain of the countries in which AIG's business is conducted have currency restrictions which generally cause a delay in a company's ability to repatriate assets and profits. (See also Notes 1, 2 and 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nINSURANCE REGULATION AND COMPETITION\\nCertain states require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies which are licensed in such states and are controlled by other corporations. Applicable legislation typically requires periodic disclosure concerning the corporation which controls the registered insurer and the other companies in the holding company system and prior approval of intercorporate transfers of assets (including in some instances payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiary) within the holding company system. AIG's subsidiaries are registered under such legislation in those states which have such requirements.(See also Note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG's insurance subsidiaries, in common with other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and by other jurisdictions in which they do business. Within the United States, the method of such regulation varies but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory and supervisory powers to an insurance official. The regulation and supervision relate primarily to approval of policy forms and rates, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, including risk based capital measurements, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on investments, restrictions on the size of risks which may be insured under a single policy, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, methods of accounting, periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies, the form and content of reports of financial condition required to be filed, and reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than security holders. (See also Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nRisk Based Capital (RBC) is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. Thus, inadequately capitalized general and life insurance companies may be identified. The RBC formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. Higher factors are applied to more risky items and lower factors are applied to less risky items. Thus, the target level of statutory surplus varies not only as a result of the insurer's size, but also on the risk profile of the insurer's operations. The RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control. The statutory surplus of each of AIG's domestic general and life insurance subsidiaries exceeded their RBC standards by considerable margins as of December 31, 2001. To the extent that any of AIG's insurance entities would fall below prescribed levels of surplus, it would be AIG's intention to infuse necessary capital to support that entity. Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act became fully effective in 2001. These provisions establish new consumer protections regarding the security and confidentiality of nonpublic personal information and require full disclosure of the privacy policies of financial institutions to their consumer customers.\"),\n",

Business', 'filename': '5272_2001.txt', 'cik': '0000005272', 'year': 2001, 'chunk_index': 12}, page_content=\"There is also legislation pending in the United States Congress and various states designed to provide additional privacy protections to consumer customers of financial institutions. These statutes and similar legislation or regulations in other jurisdictions could impact AIG's ability to market its products or otherwise limit the nature or scope of AIG's insurance and financial services operations. A substantial portion of AIG's general insurance business and a majority of its life insurance business is carried on in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies from minimal in some to stringent in others. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification or revocation by such authorities, and AIU or other AIG subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. In the past, AIU has been allowed to modify its operations to conform with new licensing requirements in most jurisdictions. In addition to licensing requirements, AIG's foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, policy language and terms, amount and type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of local investment and the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on participating policies. Some foreign countries regulate rates on various types of policies. Certain countries have established reinsurance institutions, wholly or partially owned by the state, to which admitted insurers are obligated to cede a portion of their business on terms which do not always allow foreign insurers, including AIG, full compensation. In some countries, regulations governing constitution of technical reserves and remittance balances may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets. The insurance industry is highly competitive. Within the United States, AIG's general insurance subsidiaries compete with approximately 3,300 other stock companies, specialty insurance organizations, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations. AIG's life insurance companies compete in the United States with some 2,100 life insurance companies and other participants in related financial service fields. Overseas, AIG subsidiaries compete for business with foreign insurance operations of the larger U.S. insurers and local companies in particular areas in which they are active. AIG's financial services subsidiaries operate in a highly competitive environment, both domestically and overseas. Principal sources of competition are banks, investment banks and other non-bank financial institutions. With the acquisition of AGC, the focus of AIG's financial services operations became more consumer-oriented, thereby increasing the risks of regulatory supervision and intervention. ITEM 2.\"),\n",

(See also Note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nGeneral insurance operations for the twelve month periods ending December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were as follows:\\n(a) Reflects the realignment of certain internal divisions in each year. (b) 2001 includes WTC losses of $769 million in the aggregate. In AIG's general insurance operations, 2001 net premiums written and net premiums earned increased 14.7 percent and 11.2 percent, respectively, from those of 2000. During 2001, AIG cancelled or non-renewed approximately $571 million of business worldwide that did not meet AIG's underwriting standards. In 2000, net premiums written increased 8.0 percent and net premiums earned increased 12.0 percent when compared to 1999. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\\nCommencing in the latter part of 1999 and continuing through 2001, the commercial property-casualty market place has experienced rate increases. Virtually all areas of DBG have experienced rate increases. Overall, DBG's net premiums written increased $2.26 billion or 28.5 percent in 2001 over 2000. These increases compared to an increase of $408 million or 5.4 percent in 2000 over 1999. Personal Lines' net premiums written decreased 2.2 percent or $56 million in 2001 over 2000, compared to an increase of 16.1 percent or $348 million in 2000 over 1999. Foreign general insurance net premiums written increased 1.6 percent and net premiums earned decreased 1.4 percent. Foreign general insurance operations produced 25.1 percent of the general insurance net premiums written in 2001, 28.4 percent in 2000 and 28.6 percent in 1999. In comparing the foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the results of AIG's foreign general operations during 2001 to those foreign currency exchange rates used to translate AIG's foreign general results during 2000, the U.S. dollar strengthened in value in relation to most major foreign currencies in which AIG transacts business. Accordingly, when foreign net premiums written were translated into U.S. dollars for the purposes of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, total general insurance net premiums written were approximately 2.8 percentage points less than they would have been if translated utilizing those foreign currency exchange rates which prevailed during 2000. Because of the nature and diversity of AIG's operations and the continuing rapid changes in the insurance industry worldwide, together with the factors discussed above, it is difficult to assess further or project future growth in AIG's net premiums written and reserve for losses and loss expenses. Net premiums written are initially deferred and earned primarily on a pro rata basis over the term of the related coverage. The net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period. Thus, the net unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized as net premiums earned until the end of the policy period. AIG, along with most general insurance entities, uses the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of performance. The loss ratio is the sum of losses and loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned.\"),\n",

The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. These ratios are relative measurements that describe for every $100 of net premiums earned or written, the cost of losses and statutory expenses, respectively. The combined ratio presents the total cost per $100 of premium production. A combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit; a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting loss. The statutory general insurance ratios, including WTC losses in 2001, were as follows:\\nAIG believes that underwriting profit is the true measure of the performance of the core business of a general insurance company. Underwriting profit is measured in two ways: statutory underwriting profit and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) underwriting profit. Statutory underwriting profit is arrived at by reducing net premiums earned by net losses and loss expenses incurred and net expenses incurred. Statutory accounting differs from GAAP, as statutory accounting requires immediate expense recognition and ignores the matching of revenues and expenses as required by GAAP. That is, for statutory purposes, all expenses, most specifically acquisition expenses, are recognized immediately, not consistent with the revenues earned. A basic premise of GAAP accounting is the recognition of expenses at the same time revenues are earned, the principle of matching. Therefore, to convert underwriting results to a GAAP basis, acquisition expenses are deferred and recognized over the period the related premiums written are earned. Accordingly, the statutory underwriting profit has been adjusted as a result of acquisition expenses being deferred as required by GAAP. Thus, \"adjusted underwriting profit\" is a GAAP measurement which can be viewed as gross margin or an intermediate subtotal in calculating operating income and net income. A major part of the discipline of a successful general insurance company is to produce an underwriting profit, exclusive of investment income. If underwriting is not profitable, losses incurred are a major factor. The result is that the premiums are inadequate to pay for losses and expenses and produce a profit; therefore, investment income must be used to cover underwriting losses. If assets and the income therefrom are insufficient to pay claims and expenses over extended periods, an insurance company cannot survive. For these reasons, AIG views and manages its underwriting operations separately from its investment operations.(See also the discussion under \"Liquidity\" herein.)\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nThe adjusted underwriting profits were $88 million in 2001, $785 million in 2000 and $669 million in 1999. When WTC losses in 2001 are excluded from losses incurred, the adjusted underwriting profit would be $857 million for 2001, a 9.2 percent increase over 2000. This increase was primarily due to the domestic adjusted underwriting profit resulting from the disciplined underwriting of DBG.'),\n",

(See also Notes 4 and 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG\\'s results reflect the net impact of incurred losses from catastrophes approximating $867 million in 2001 (which include $769 million in WTC losses and $50 million with respect to the Northridge earthquake, following the unprecedented decision by the State of California to require all insurers to reopen claims nearly eight years after the occurrence), $44 million in 2000 and $156 million in 1999. AIG\\'s gross incurred losses from catastrophes approximated $2.15 billion in 2001 (which include $2.0 billion in WTC losses), $112 million in 2000 and $472 million in 1999. While AIG believes that it has taken appropriate steps to reduce the magnitude of possible future losses, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events of unanticipated frequency or severity, such as a terrorist attack, earthquake or hurricane, that causes insured losses could have a material adverse effect on AIG\\'s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. Current techniques and models may not accurately predict in the future the probability of catastrophic events and the extent of the resulting losses. Moreover, one or more catastrophe losses could impact negatively AIG\\'s reinsurers and result in an inability of AIG to collect reinsurance recoverables. The impact of losses caused by catastrophes can fluctuate widely from year to year, making comparisons of recurring type business more difficult. The pro forma table below excludes catastrophe losses in order to present comparable results of AIG\\'s recurring core underwriting operations. The pro forma consolidated statutory general insurance ratios would be as follows:\\nAIG\\'s historic ability to maintain its combined ratio below 100 is primarily attributable to the profitability of AIG\\'s foreign general insurance operations and AIG\\'s emphasis on maintaining its disciplined underwriting, especially in the domestic specialty markets. In addition, AIG does not seek premium growth where rates do not adequately reflect its assessment of exposures. General insurance net investment income in 2001 increased 7.1 percent when compared to 2000. In 2000, net investment income increased 7.3 percent over 1999. The growth in net investment income in each of the three years was primarily attributable to new cash flow for investment. The new cash flow was generated from net general insurance operating cash flow and included the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income. (See also the discussion under \"Liquidity\" herein and Note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nGeneral insurance realized capital losses were $130 million in 2001, and realized capital gains were $38 million in 2000 and $295 million in 1999. These realized gains and losses resulted from the ongoing investment management of the general insurance portfolios within the overall objectives of the general insurance operations and arose primarily from the disposition of equity securities and available for sale fixed maturities as well as redemptions of fixed maturities. General insurance operating income in 2001 decreased 19.1 percent when compared to 2000 primarily due to the WTC losses. Estimated WTC losses recorded in 2001 amounted to $769 million, including $200 million from Transatlantic. Adjusted general insurance operating income, which excludes WTC losses, as well as realized capital losses, increased 7.6 percent to $3.75 billion during 2001. General insurance operating income in 2000 increased 1.3 percent when compared to 1999. The contribution of general insurance operating income to income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes and excluding acquisition, restructuring and related charges was 28.1 percent in 2001 compared to 34.1 percent in 2000 and 37.0 percent in 1999. AIG is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its general insurance operations. AIG is cognizant of the need to exercise good judgment in the selection and approval of both domestic and foreign companies participating in its reinsurance programs. AIG insures risks in over 70 countries and its reinsurance programs must be coordinated in order to provide AIG the level of reinsurance protection that AIG desires. These reinsurance arrangements do not relieve AIG from its direct obligations to its insureds. AIG\\'s general reinsurance assets amounted to $27.65 billion and resulted from AIG\\'s reinsurance arrangements. Thus, a credit exposure existed at December 31, 2001 with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer may not be able to reimburse AIG under the terms of these reinsurance arrangements. AIG manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound, and when necessary AIG holds substantial collateral in the form of funds, securities and/or irrevocable letters of credit. This collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods on an individual reinsurer basis. At December 31, 2001, approximately 43 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from unauthorized reinsurers. In order to obtain statutory recognition, nearly all of these balances were collateralized. The remaining 57 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from authorized reinsurers and over 97 percent of such balances are from reinsurers rated A-(excellent) or better, as rated by\\nMANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\\nA.M.

At December 31, 2001, AIG had allowances for unrecoverable reinsurance approximating $75 million. At that date AIG had no significant reinsurance recoverables from any individual reinsurer which is financially troubled (e.g., liquidated, insolvent, in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction). AIG's Reinsurance Security Department conducts ongoing detailed assessments of the reinsurance markets and current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic. Such assessments include, but are not limited to, identifying if a reinsurer is appropriately licensed, and has sufficient financial capacity, and the local economic environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates. This department also reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for collateral. In addition, AIG's Credit Risk Committee reviews the credit limits for and concentrations with any one reinsurer.

The ceded reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate ceded losses including provisions for ceded IBNR and loss expenses.

At December 31, 2001, general insurance net loss reserves increased $944 million from prior year end to $25.90 billion. The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance. The methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in operating income currently. It is management's belief that the general insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover all general insurance net losses and loss expenses as at December 31, 2001. While AIG continually reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that AIG's ultimate loss reserves will not adversely develop and materially exceed AIG's loss reserves as of December 31, 2001. In the future, if the general insurance net loss reserves develop deficiently, such deficiency would have an adverse impact on results of operations. In a very broad sense, the general loss reserves can be categorized into two distinct groups: one group being long tail casualty lines of business. Such lines include excess and umbrella liability, directors and officers' liability, professional liability, medical malpractice, general liability, products' liability, and related classes. These lines account for approximately one-half of net losses and loss expenses. The other group is short tail lines of business consisting principally of property lines, personal lines and certain classes of casualty lines. Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses (net losses) for long tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the line and volume of the business involved. In the more recent accident years of long tail casualty lines there is limited statistical credibility in reported net losses. That is, a relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims and expenses and an even smaller proportion would be net losses paid. A relatively high proportion of net losses would therefore be IBNR. A variety of actuarial methods and assumptions are normally employed to estimate net losses for long tail casualty lines. These methods ordinarily involve the use of loss trend factors intended to reflect the estimated annual growth in loss costs from one accident year to the next. For the majority of long tail casualty lines, net loss trend factors approximated four percent. Loss trend factors reflect many items including changes in claims handling, exposure and policy forms and current and future estimates of monetary inflation and social inflation. Thus, many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the year to year growth in loss costs. Therefore, AIG's carried net long tail loss reserves are judgmentally set as well as tested for reasonableness using the most appropriate loss trend factors for each class of business. In the evaluation of AIG's net loss reserves, loss trend factors vary slightly, depending on the particular class and nature of the business involved. These factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss experience. Estimation of net losses for short tail business is less complex than for long tail casualty lines. Loss cost trends for many property lines can generally be assumed to be similar to the\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\ngrowth in exposure of such lines. For example, if the fire insurance coverage remained proportional to the actual value of the property, the growth in property's exposure to fire loss can be approximated by the amount of insurance purchased. For other property and short tail casualty lines, the loss trend is implicitly assumed to grow at the rate that reported net losses grow from one year to the next. The concerns noted above for longer tail casualty lines with respect to the limited statistical credibility of reported net losses generally do not apply to shorter tail lines. AIG continues to receive claims asserting injuries from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites (hereinafter referred to collectively as environmental claims) and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. The vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. AIG has established a specialized claims unit which investigates and adjusts all such asbestos and environmental claims. Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained an absolute exclusion for pollution related damage. However, AIG currently underwrites environmental impairment liability insurance on a claims made basis and has excluded such claims from the analyses included herein. Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a difficult process. These asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated by conventional reserving techniques as previously described. Quantitative techniques frequently have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including managerial judgment. Significant factors which affect the trends which influence the development of asbestos and environmental claims are the inconsistent court resolutions and judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage. The current case law can be characterized as still evolving and there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop in the near future. Additionally, the exposure for cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites involves issues such as allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and the government's refusal to release parties. In the interim, AIG and other industry members have and will continue to litigate the broadening judicial interpretation of the policy coverage and the liability issues. At the current time, it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the same degree of reliability as is the case for other types of claims. Such development will be affected by the extent to which courts continue to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage, as they have in the past, as well as by the changes in Superfund and waste dump site coverage issues. Although the estimated liabilities for these claims are subject to a significantly greater margin of error than for other claims, the reserves carried for these claims at December 31, 2001 are believed to be adequate as these reserves are based on the known facts and current law. Furthermore, as AIG's net exposure retained relative to the gross exposure written was lower in 1984 and prior years, the potential impact of these claims is much smaller on the net loss reserves than on the gross loss reserves. In the future, if the environmental claims develop deficiently, such deficiency would have an adverse impact on future results of operations. (See the previous discussion on reinsurance collectibility herein.)\\nThe majority of AIG's exposures for asbestos and environmental claims are excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. Thus, the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity reserves. That is, litigation expenses are included within the limits of the liability AIG incurs. Individual significant claim liabilities, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case basis. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\\nA summary of reserve activity, including estimates for applicable IBNR, relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 follows. The gross and net IBNR included in the aforementioned reserve for losses and loss expenses at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were estimated as follows:\\nA summary of asbestos and environmental claims count activity for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was as follows:\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nThe average cost per claim settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was as follows:\\nA.M. Best, an insurance rating agency, has developed a survival ratio to measure the number of years it would take a company to exhaust both its asbestos and environmental reserves for losses and loss expenses based on that company's current level of asbestos and environmental claims payments. This is a ratio derived by taking the current ending losses and loss expense reserves and dividing by the average annual payments for the prior three years. Therefore, the ratio derived is a simplistic measure of an estimate of the number of years it would be before the current ending losses and loss expense reserves would be paid off using recent average payments. The higher the ratio, the more years the reserves for losses and loss expenses cover these claims payments. These ratios are computed based on the ending reserves for losses and loss expenses over the respective claims settlements during the fiscal year. Such payments include indemnity payments and legal and loss adjustment payments. It should be noted, however, that this is an extremely simplistic approach to measuring asbestos and environmental reserve levels. Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have significant impact on the amount of asbestos and environmental losses and loss expense reserves, ultimate payments thereof and the resultant ratio. The developed survival ratios include both involuntary and voluntary indemnity payments. Involuntary payments are primarily attributable to court judgments, court orders, covered claims with no coverage defenses, state mandated cleanup costs, claims where AIG's coverage defenses are minimal, and settlements made less than six months before the first trial setting. Also, AIG considers all legal and loss adjustment payments as involuntary. AIG believes voluntary indemnity payments should be excluded from the survival ratio. The special asbestos and environmental claims unit actively manages AIG's asbestos and environmental claims and proactively pursues early settlement of environmental claims for all known and unknown sites. As a result, AIG reduces its exposure to future environmental loss contingencies. AIG's survival ratios for involuntary asbestos and environmental claims, separately and combined, were based upon a three year average payment. These ratios for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were as follows:\\nAIG's operations are negatively impacted under guarantee fund assessment laws which exist in most states. As a result of operating in a state which has guarantee fund assessment laws, a solvent insurance company may be assessed for certain obligations arising from the insolvencies of other insurance companies which operated in that state. AIG generally records these assessments upon notice. Additionally, certain states permit at least a portion of the assessed amount to be used as a credit against a company's future premium tax liabilities.\"),\n",

ILFC had an Export Credit Facility up to a maximum of $4.3 billion, for approximately 75 aircraft to be delivered through 2001. ILFC had the right, but was not required, to use the facility to fund 85 percent of each aircraft\\'s purchase price. This facility was guaranteed by various European Export Credit Agencies. The interest rate varies from 5.75 percent to 5.90 percent on the first 75 aircraft depending on the delivery date of the aircraft. At December 31, 2001, ILFC had $2.37 billion outstanding under this facility. Borrowings with respect to this facility are included in Notes and Bonds Payable in the accompanying table of borrowings. The proceeds of ILFC\\'s debt financing are primarily used to purchase flight equipment, including progress payments during the construction phase.

(See also the discussions under \"Operational Review\" and \"Liquidity\" herein.)\\nDuring 2001, AIG issued $137 million principal amount of Medium Term Notes, and $177 million of previously issued notes matured. At December 31, 2001, AIG had $644 million in aggregate principal amount of debt securities registered for issuance from time to time. On November 9, 2001, AIG received proceeds of approximately $1 billion from the issuance of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2031 with an aggregate principal amount at maturity of approximately $1.52 billion. Commencing January 1, 2002, the debentures are convertible into shares of AIG common stock at a conversion rate of 6.0627 shares per $1,000 principal amount of debentures if AIG common stock trades at certain levels for certain time periods. The debentures are callable by AIG on or after November 9, 2006. Also, holders can require AIG to repurchase these debentures once every five years.

The change for 2001 with respect to the unrealized appreciation of invest-\\nMANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nments, net of taxes was primarily due to the decline in domestic interest rates. The transfer of bonds in the held to maturity, at amortized cost category to the bonds available for sale, at market value category in accordance with the transition provisions of FASB 133 resulted in a gain of $339 million recorded in the statement of comprehensive income as a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment. At December 31, 2001, capital funds included a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment gain of $150 million. During 2001, there was a loss of $443 million, net of taxes relating to derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments. (See also the discussion under \"Operational Review\" and \"Liquidity\" herein, Notes 1(x) and 8(d) of Notes to Financial Statements and the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.) During 2001, retained earnings increased $4.62 billion, resulting from net income less dividends. During 2001, AIG repurchased in the open market 13,619,900 shares of its common stock. Included in these repurchases were approximately 10 million shares which were exempt from pooling of interests accounting restrictions under orders issued by the SEC following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. During 2002 through February 28, AIG repurchased in the open market an additional 4,250,000 shares of its common stock. AIG intends to continue to buy its common shares in the open market for general corporate purposes, including to satisfy its obligations under various employee benefit plans. Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by statutory authorities. AIG has in the past reinvested most of its unrestricted earnings in its operations and believes such continued reinvestment in the future will be adequate to meet any foreseeable capital needs. However, AIG may choose from time to time to raise additional funds through the issuance of additional securities. At December 31, 2001, there were no significant statutory or regulatory issues which would impair AIG\\'s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, but there can be no assurance that such issues will not arise in the future. To AIG\\'s knowledge, no AIG company is on any regulatory or similar \"watch list\". (See also the discussion under \"Liquidity\" herein and Note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG\\'s insurance subsidiaries, in common with other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has developed Risk-Based Capital (RBC) requirements. RBC relates an individual insurance company\\'s statutory surplus to the risk inherent in its overall operations. At December 31, 2001, the adjusted capital of each of AIG\\'s domestic general companies and of each of AIG\\'s domestic life companies exceeded each of their RBC standards by considerable margins. Federal, state or local legislation may affect AIG\\'s ability to operate and expand its various financial services businesses and changes in the current laws, regulations or interpretations thereof may have a material adverse effect on these businesses. A substantial portion of AIG\\'s general insurance business and a majority of its life insurance business are conducted in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies from minimal in some to stringent in others. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. Thus, AIG\\'s insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. AIG\\'s international operations include operations in various developing nations. Both current and future foreign operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable political developments up to and including nationalization of AIG\\'s operations without compensation. Adverse effects resulting from any one country may impact AIG\\'s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition depending on the magnitude of the event and AIG\\'s net financial exposure at that time in that country. The maturity schedule of AIG\\'s contractual obligations at December 31, 2001 was as follows:\\n*Excludes commercial paper and includes ILFC\\'s capital lease obligations. American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nThe maturity schedule of AIG\\'s Other Commercial Commitments at December 31, 2001 was as follows:\\n(a) Primarily liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions. (b) Primarily in connection with aircraft acquisitions. AIG uses special purposes vehicles (SPVs) primarily in connection with certain guaranteed investment contract programs (\"GIC Programs\") written by its life insurance subsidiaries, certain products provided by AIGFP, and certain invested asset and asset management activities. In the GIC Programs, AIG\\'s life insurance subsidiaries (principally SunAmerica Life Insurance Company) provide guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) to SPVs which are not controlled by AIG. The SPVs issue notes or bonds which are sold to third party institutional investors. Neither AIG nor the insurance company issuing the GICs has any obligation to the investors in the notes or bonds. The proceeds from the SPVs issuance of securities are used to invest in the GICs. The insurance company subsidiaries use these proceeds to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities, primarily investment grade bonds (see also the discussion under \"Liquidity: Insurance Invested Assets\"). Both the assets and the liabilities arising from these GIC Programs are presented in AIG\\'s consolidated balance sheet. Thus, at December 31, 2001, approximately $22 billion of Policyholders\\' contract deposits represented liabilities from issuances of GICs included in these GIC Programs, offset by the proceeds from the issuances included as insurance invested assets. AIGFP uses SPVs as an integral part of its ongoing operations with respect to specific structured transactions with independent third parties. AIGFP controls and manages the assets and liabilities with respect to these SPVs, subject to certain transaction specific limitations. These SPVs are fully consolidated by AIG (see the discussions of AIGFP under \"Operations Review: Financial Services Operations\"). AIG\\'s insurance operations also invest in assets of SPVs. These SPVs are established by unrelated third parties. Investments include collateralized mortgage backed securities and similar securities backed by pools of mortgages, consumer receivables or other assets. The investment in an SPV allows AIG\\'s insurance entities to purchase assets permitted by insurance regulations while maximizing the return on these assets. AIG provides investment management services to certain SPVs. AIG receives management fees for these services and may take a minority ownership interest in these SPVs. AIG services may be terminated with or without cause. To facilitate and expand certain retirement savings and asset management activities, AIG establishes SPVs. AIG receives fees for management of the assets held in the SPV which support the issuance of securities such as collateralized bond obligations sold by the SPV to independent third party investors. These SPVs serve a variety of business purposes, including financing, liquidity, or to facilitate independent third party management participation. AIG has established stringent guidelines with respect to the formation of and investment in SPVs. LIQUIDITY\\nAIG\\'s liquidity is primarily derived from the operating cash flows of its general and life insurance operations. At December 31, 2001, AIG\\'s consolidated invested assets included $8.09 billion of cash and short-term investments. Consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in 2001 amounted to $7.71 billion. Sources of funds considered in meeting the objectives of AIG\\'s financial services operations include guaranteed investment agreements, issuance of long and short-term debt, maturities and sales of securities available for sale, securities sold under repurchase agreements, trading liabilities, securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased, issuance of equity, and cash provided from such operations. AIG\\'s strong\\nMANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\\ncapital position is integral to managing this liquidity, as it enables AIG to raise funds in diverse markets worldwide. (See also the discussions under \"Capital Resources\" herein.)\\nManagement believes that AIG\\'s liquid assets, its net cash provided by operations, and access to the capital markets will enable it to meet any foreseeable cash requirements. The liquidity of the combined insurance operations is derived both domestically and abroad. The combined insurance operating cash flow is derived from two sources, underwriting operations and investment operations. In the aggregate, AIG\\'s insurance operations generated approximately $27.4 billion in pre-tax cash flow during 2001. Cash flow includes periodic premium collections, including policyholders\\' contract deposits, paid loss recoveries less reinsurance premiums, losses, benefits, acquisition and operating expenses. Generally, there is a time lag from when premiums are collected and, when as a result of the occurrence of events specified in the policy, the losses and benefits are paid. AIG\\'s insurance investment operations generated approximately $14.1 billion in investment income cash flow during 2001. Investment income cash flow is primarily derived from interest and dividends received and includes realized capital gains net of realized capital losses. (See also the discussions under \"Operational Review: General Insurance Operations\" and -- \"Life Insurance Operations\" herein.)\\nWith respect to general insurance operations, if paid losses accelerated beyond AIG\\'s ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows, AIG would need to liquidate a portion of its general insurance investment portfolio and/or arrange for financing. Such events that may cause such a liquidity strain could be the result of several catastrophic events occurring in a relatively short period of time. Additional strain on liquidity could occur if the investments sold to fund such paid losses were sold into a depressed market place and/or reinsurance recoverable on such paid losses became uncollectible or collateral supporting such reinsurance recoverable significantly decreased in value. (See also the discussions under \"Operational Review: General Insurance Operations\" herein.)\\nWith respect to life insurance operations, if a substantial portion of the life insurance operations bond portfolio diminished significantly in value and/or defaulted, AIG would need to liquidate other portions of its life insurance investment portfolio and/or arrange financing. Such events that may cause such a liquidity strain could be the result of economic collapse of a nation or region in which AIG life insurance operations exist, nationalization, terrorist acts or other such economic or political upheaval. (See also the discussions under \"Operational Review: Life Insurance Operations\" herein.)\\nIn addition to the combined insurance pre-tax operating cash flow, AIG\\'s insurance operations held $7.2 billion in cash and short-term investments at December 31, 2001. The aforementioned operating cash flow and the cash and short-term balances held provided AIG\\'s insurance operations with a significant amount of liquidity. This liquidity is available, among other things, to purchase high quality and diversified fixed income securities and to a lesser extent marketable equity securities and to provide mortgage loans on real estate, policy loans and collateral loans. This cash flow coupled with proceeds of approximately $116 billion from the maturities, sales and redemptions of fixed income securities and from the sale of equity securities was used to purchase approximately $140 billion of fixed income securities and marketable equity securities during 2001. The following table is a summary of AIG\\'s invested assets by significant segment, including investment income due and accrued of $3.68 billion and $3.52 billion and real estate of $2.65 billion and $2.08 billion, at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively:\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nINSURANCE INVESTED ASSETS\\nThe following tables summarize the composition of AIG\\'s insurance invested assets by insurance segment, including investment income due and accrued and real estate, at December 31, 2001 and 2000:\\n(a) Includes $842 million of bond trading securities, at market value.

(b) Includes $1.19 billion of non-redeemable preferred stocks, at market value. Generally, insurance regulations restrict the types of assets in which an insurance company may invest. With respect to fixed maturities, AIG\\'s general strategy is to invest in high quality securities while maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure to issuer, industry and/or country concentrations. With respect to general insurance, AIG\\'s strategy is to invest in longer duration fixed maturities to maximize the yields at the date of purchase. With respect to life insurance, AIG\\'s strategy is to produce cash flows required to meet maturing insurance liabilities (See also the discussion under \"Operational Review: Life Insurance Operations\" herein.)\\nThe fair value of the fixed maturity available for sale portfolio is subject to decline as interest rates rise and subject to increase as interest rates decline. Such changes in fair value are presented as a component of comprehensive income in unrealized appreciation of investments, net of taxes. The fixed maturities held to maturity portfolio were transferred to bonds available for sale, at market value as at January 1, 2001 as permitted and in accordance with the transition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 \"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\" (FASB 133). (See also the discussion under \"Accounting Standards\" herein.)\\nAt December 31, 2001, approximately 69 percent of the fixed maturities investments were domestic securities. Approximately 30 percent of such domestic securities were rated AAA. Approximately 9 percent were below investment grade or not rated. A significant portion of the foreign insurance fixed income portfolio is rated by Moody\\'s, Standard & Poor\\'s (S&P) or similar foreign services. Similar credit quality rating services are not available in all overseas locations. AIG annually reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio nonrated fixed income investments, including mortgages. At December 31, 2001, approximately 10 percent of the foreign fixed income investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of AIG\\'s internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to\\nMANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\\nsecurities so rated. Approximately 16 percent were below investment grade or not rated at that date. A large portion of the foreign insurance fixed income portfolio are sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting the policy liabilities in the country of issuance. At December 31, 2001, approximately 16 percent of the fixed maturities portfolio was CMOs, including commercial mortgage backed securities. Substantially all of the CMOs were investment grade and approximately 26 percent of the CMOs were backed by various U.S. government agencies. CMOs are exposed to interest rate risk as the duration and ultimate realized yield would be affected by the accelerated prepayments of the underlying mortgages. Any fixed income security may be subject to downgrade for a variety of reasons subsequent to any balance sheet date. AIG invests in equities for various reasons, including diversifying its overall exposure to interest rate risk. Equity securities are subject to declines in fair value.'),\n",

Where declines in value of fixed income and equity securities below amortized cost or cost are considered to be other than temporary, a charge is reflected in income for the difference between amortized cost or cost and estimated net realizable value. Mortgage loans on real estate, policy and collateral loans comprised 6.6 percent of AIG\\'s insurance invested assets at December 31, 2001. AIG\\'s insurance operations\\' holdings of real estate mortgages amounted to $10.71 billion of which 85.6 percent was domestic. At December 31, 2001, only a nominal amount were in default. It is AIG\\'s practice to maintain a maximum loan to value ratio of 75 percent at loan origination. At December 31, 2001, AIG\\'s insurance holdings of collateral loans amounted to $667 million, all of which were foreign. It is AIG\\'s strategy to enter into mortgage and collateral loans as an adjunct primarily to life insurance fixed maturity investments. AIG\\'s policy loans increased from $5.47 billion at December 31, 2000 to $5.79 billion at December 31, 2001. Short-term investments represent amounts invested in various internal and external money market funds, time deposits and cash held. AIG\\'s real estate investment properties are primarily occupied by AIG\\'s various operations. The current market value of these properties considerably exceeds their carrying value. Other invested assets were primarily comprised of both foreign and domestic private placements, limited partnerships, outside managed funds, and collateral held with respect to AIG\\'s securities lending program. When permitted by regulatory authorities and when deemed necessary to protect insurance assets, including invested assets, from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, AIG and its insurance subsidiaries may enter into derivative transactions as end users. (See also the discussion under \"Derivatives\" herein.)\\nIn certain jurisdictions, significant regulatory and/or foreign governmental barriers exist which may not permit the immediate free flow of funds between insurance subsidiaries or from the insurance subsidiaries to AIG parent. These barriers generally cause only minor delays in the outward remittance of the funds. AIG\\'s insurance operations are exposed to market risk. Market risk is the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices. Measuring potential losses in fair values has recently become the focus of risk management efforts by many companies. Such measurements are performed through the application of various statistical techniques. One such technique is Value at Risk (VaR). VaR is a summary statistical measure that uses historical interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices and estimates the volatility and correlation of each of these rates and prices to calculate the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time given a certain probability. AIG believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk. While VaR models are relatively sophisticated, the quantitative market risk information generated is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related models. Therefore, such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management. AIG has performed a VaR analysis to estimate the maximum potential loss of fair value for each of AIG\\'s insurance segments and for each market risk within each insurance segment. In this analysis, financial instrument assets include the domestic and foreign invested assets excluding real estate and investment income due and accrued. Financial instrument liabilities include reserve for losses and loss expenses, reserve for unearned premiums, future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and policyholders\\' funds. Due to the nature of each insurance segment, AIG manages the general and life insurance operations separately. As a result, AIG manages separately the invested assets of each.

MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\\nFINANCIAL SERVICES, AND RETIREMENT SAVINGS & Asset Management Invested Assets\\nThe following table is a summary of the composition of AIG\\'s financial services, and retirement savings & asset management invested assets at December 31, 2001 and 2000. (See also the discussions under \"Operational Review: Financial Services Operations\", \"Operational Review: Retirement Savings & Asset Management Operations\", \"Capital Resources\" and \"Derivatives\" herein.)\\nAs previously discussed, the cash used for the purchase of flight equipment is derived primarily from the proceeds of ILFC\\'s debt financings. The primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are the cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of flight equipment and the rollover and refinancing of the prior debt. During 2001, ILFC acquired flight equipment costing $4.41 billion. (See also the discussion under \"Operational Review: Financial Services Operations\" and Capital Resources\" herein.)\\nAt December 31, 2001, ILFC had committed to purchase 551 aircraft deliverable from 2002 through 2010 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $32.1 billion and had options to purchase 49 aircraft deliverable from 2002 through 2008 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $3.0 billion. As of March 19, 2002, ILFC has entered into leases for all of the aircraft to be delivered in 2002 and 92 of 467 aircraft to be delivered subsequent to 2002. ILFC will be required to find customers for any aircraft presently on order and any aircraft to be ordered, and it must arrange financing for portions of the purchase price of such equipment. In a rising interest rate environment, ILFC negotiates higher lease rates on any new contracts. ILFC has been successful to date both in placing its new aircraft on lease or under sales contract and obtaining adequate financing, but there can be no assurance that such success will continue in future environments. ILFC is exposed to market risk and the risk of loss of fair value and possible liquidity strain resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates. As of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, AIG statistically measured the aforementioned loss of fair value through the application of a VaR model. In this analysis, the net fair value of ILFC was determined using the financial instrument assets which included the tax adjusted future flight equipment lease revenue and the financial instrument liabilities which included the future servicing of the current debt. The estimated impact of the current derivative positions was also taken into account. AIG calculated the VaR with respect to the net fair value of ILFC using the historical simulation methodology, as previously described. As of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, the VaR with respect to the aforementioned net fair value of ILFC was approximately $10 million and $11 million, respectively. AIG\\'s Consumer Finance operations provide a wide variety of consumer finance products both domestically and overseas.'),\n",

These products are funded through various borrowings including commercial paper and medium term notes. AIG\\'s Consumer Finance operations are exposed to credit risk and risk of loss resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates. Over half of the loan balance is related to real estate loans which are substantially collateralized by the related properties. With respect to credit losses, the allowance for finance receivable losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to absorb anticipated credit losses existing in that portfolio. AIGFP\\'s derivative transactions are carried at market value or at estimated fair value when market prices are not readily available. AIGFP reduces its economic risk exposure through similarly valued offsetting transactions including swaps, trading securities, options, forwards and futures. The\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nestimated fair values of these transactions represent assessments of the present value of expected future cash flows. These transactions are exposed to liquidity risk if AIGFP were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity.

Securities purchased under agreements to resell are treated as collateralized transactions. AIGFP takes possession of or obtains a security interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell. AIGFP further minimizes its credit risk by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and, when AIGFP deems necessary, it requires additional collateral to be deposited. Trading securities, at market value are marked to market daily and are held to meet the short-term risk management objectives of AIGFP. AIGFP is exposed to credit risk. If its securities available for sale portfolio were to suffer significant default and the collateral held declined significantly in value with no replacement, AIGFP could have a liquidity strain. AIG guarantees AIGFP\\'s debt and, as a result, is responsible for all of AIGFP\\'s obligations. AIGTG conducts, as principal, market making and trading activities in foreign exchange, and commodities, primarily precious and base metals. AIGTG owns inventories in the commodities in which it trades and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the use of swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts. AIGTG uses derivatives to manage the economic exposure of its various trading positions and transactions from adverse movements of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. AIGTG supports its trading activities largely through trading liabilities, unrealized losses on swaps, short-term borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities and commodities sold but not yet purchased. (See also the discussions under \"Capital Resources\" and \"Derivatives\" herein.)\\nThe gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses of AIGFP and AIGTG included in the financial services assets and liabilities at December 31, 2001 were as follows:\\n(a) See also Note 8(e) of Notes to Financial Statements. (b) These amounts are also presented as the respective balance sheet amounts. (c) At December 31, 2001, AIGTG\\'s replacement values with respect to interest rate and currency swaps were $549 million. AIGFP\\'s interest rate and currency risks on securities available for sale, at market, are managed by taking offsetting positions on a security by security basis, thereby offsetting a significant portion of the unrealized appreciation or depreciation. At December 31, 2001, the unrealized gains and losses remaining after the benefit of the offsets were $75 million and $67 million, respectively. Trading securities, at market value, and securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased, at market value are marked to market daily with the unrealized gain or loss being recognized in income at that time. These securities are held to meet the short-term risk management objectives of AIGFP and AIGTG. The senior management of AIG defines the policies and establishes general operating parameters for AIGFP and AIGTG. AIG\\'s senior management has established various oversight committees to review the various financial market, operational and credit issues of AIGFP and AIGTG. The senior managements of AIGFP and AIGTG report the results of their respective operations to and review future strategies with AIG\\'s senior management. AIG actively manages the exposures to limit potential losses, while maximizing the rewards afforded by these business opportunities. In doing so, AIG must continually manage a variety of exposures including credit, market, liquidity, operational and legal risks. Market risk arises principally from the uncertainty that future earnings are exposed to potential changes in volatility, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices. AIG generally controls its exposure to market risk by taking offsetting positions. AIG\\'s philosophy with respect to its financial services operations is to minimize or set\\nMANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\\nlimits for open or uncovered positions that are to be carried. Credit risk exposure is separately managed. (See the discussion on the management of credit risk below.)\\nAIG\\'s Market Risk Management Department provides detailed independent review of AIG\\'s market exposures, particularly those market exposures of AIGFP and AIGTG. This department determines whether AIG\\'s market risks, as well as those market risks of individual subsidiaries, are within the parameters established by AIG\\'s senior management. Well established market risk management techniques such as sensitivity analysis are used. Additionally, this department verifies that specific market risks of each of certain subsidiaries are managed and hedged by that subsidiary. AIGFP is exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of interest rates and the shape and slope of the yield curve. AIGFP hedges its exposure to interest rate risk by entering into transactions such as interest rate swaps and options and purchasing U.S. and foreign government obligations. AIGFP is exposed to market risk due to changes in and volatility of foreign currency exchange rates. AIGFP hedges its foreign currency exchange risk primarily through the use of currency swaps, options, forwards and futures. AIGFP is exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of equity prices which affect the value of securities or instruments that derive their value from a particular stock, a basket of stocks or a stock index. AIGFP reduces the risk of loss inherent in its inventory in equity securities by entering into hedging transactions, including equity swaps and options and purchasing U.S. and foreign government obligations. AIGFP does not seek to manage the market risk of each of its transactions through an individual offsetting transaction. Rather, AIGFP takes a portfolio approach to the management of its market risk exposure. AIGFP values its portfolio, including interest rate swaps, currency swaps, equity swaps, swaptions, options and forwards, at market value or estimated fair value when market values are not readily available. Unrealized gains and losses, with respect to this portfolio are reflected in income currently. These valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows of AIGFP\\'s transactions and may include reserves for such risks as are deemed appropriate by AIGFP\\'s and AIG\\'s management. AIGFP evaluates the portfolio\\'s discounted cash flows with reference to current market conditions, maturities within the portfolio and other relevant factors. The aforementioned estimated fair values are based upon the use of valuation models. These models utilize, among other things, market liquidity and current interest, foreign exchange and volatility rates. AIGFP attempts to secure reliable and independent current market prices, such as published exchange prices, external subscription services such as from Bloomberg or Reuters or third party broker quotes for use in this model. When such prices are not available, AIGFP uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions. These valuation models are integrated into the evaluation of the portfolio, as described above, in order to provide timely information for the market risk management of the portfolio. Based upon this evaluation, AIGFP determines what, if any, offsetting transactions are necessary to reduce the market risk exposure of the portfolio. AIG manages its market risk with a variety of transactions, including swaps, trading securities, futures and forward contracts and other transactions as appropriate. The recorded values of these transactions may be different than the values that might be realized if AIGFP were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes that such differences are not significant to the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Such differences would be immediately recognized when the transactions are sold or closed out prior to maturity. Additionally, depending upon the changes in interest rates and other market movements during the day, AIGFP\\'s system will produce reports for management\\'s consideration for intraday offsetting positions. Overnight, the system generates reports which recommend the types of offsets management should consider for the following day. Additionally, AIGFP operates in major business centers overseas and is essentially open for business 24 hours a day. Thus, the market exposure and offset strategies are monitored, reviewed and coordinated around the clock. Therefore, offsetting adjustments can be made as and when necessary from any AIGFP office in the world. As part of its monitoring and controlling of its exposure to market risk, AIGFP applies various testing techniques which reflect potential market movements. These techniques vary by currency and are regularly changed to reflect factors affecting the derivatives portfolio. In addition to the daily monitoring, AIGFP\\'s senior management and local risk managers conduct a weekly review of the derivatives portfolio and existing hedges. This review includes an examination of the portfolio\\'s risk measures, such as aggregate option sensitivity to movements in market variables. AIGFP\\'s management may change these measures to reflect their judgment and evaluation of the dynamics of the markets. This management group will also determine whether additional or alternative action is required in order to manage the portfolio. All of AIGTG\\'s market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for trading purposes. The fair values of AIGTG\\'s financial instruments are exposed to market risk as a result of adverse market changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and adverse changes in the liquidity of the markets in which AIGTG trades. AIGTG\\'s approach to managing market risk is to establish an appropriate offsetting position to a particular transaction or group of transactions depending upon the extent of market risk AIGTG expects to reduce. American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nAIGTG\\'s senior management has established positions and stop-loss limits for each line of business. AIGTG\\'s traders are required to maintain positions within these limits. These positions are monitored during the day either manually and/or through on-line computer systems. In addition, these positions are reviewed by AIGTG\\'s management. Reports which present each trading books position and the prior day\\'s profit and loss are reviewed by traders, head traders and AIGTG\\'s senior management. Based upon these and other reports, AIGTG\\'s senior management may determine to adjust AIGTG\\'s risk profile. AIGTG attempts to secure reliable current market prices, such as published prices or third party quotes, to value its derivatives. Where such prices are not available, AIGTG uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions. The methodology may reflect interest and exchange rates, commodity prices, volatility rates, market liquidity and other relevant factors. Unrealized gains and losses, with respect to AIGTG\\'s positions are reflected in income currently. A significant portion of AIGTG\\'s business is transacted in liquid markets. Certain of AIGTG\\'s derivative product exposures are evaluated using simulation techniques which consider such factors as changes in currency and commodity prices, interest rates, volatility levels, market liquidity and the effect of time. AIGFP and AIGTG are both exposed to the risk of loss of fair value from adverse fluctuations in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices. AIG statistically measured the losses of fair value through the application of a VaR model. AIG separately calculated the VaR with respect to AIGFP and AIGTG, as AIG manages these operations separately. AIGFP\\'s and AIGTG\\'s asset and liability portfolios for which the VaR analyses were performed included over the counter and exchange traded investments, derivative instruments and commodities. Since the market risk with respect to securities available for sale, at market is substantially hedged, segregation of market sensitive instruments into trading and other than trading was not deemed necessary. AIG calculated the VaR with respect to AIGFP and AIGTG as of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000. AIG uses the historical simulation methodology which entails re-pricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period. In this case, the most recent three years of historical market information for interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity index prices were used to construct the historical scenarios. For each scenario, each transaction was re-priced.'),\n",

Derivatives payments may be based on interest rates and exchange rates and/or prices of certain securities, certain commodities, or financial or commodity indices. The more significant types of derivative arrangements in which AIG transacts are swaps, forwards, futures and options. Derivatives are generally either negotiated over the counter contracts or standardized contracts executed on an exchange. Standardized exchange traded derivatives include futures and options which can be readily bought or sold over recognized security or commodity exchanges and settled daily through such clearing houses. Negotiated over the counter derivatives include forwards, swaps and options. Over the counter derivatives are generally not traded like exchange traded securities and the terms of over the counter derivatives are non-standard and unique to each contract. However, in the normal course of business, with the agreement of the original counterparty, these contracts may be terminated early or assigned to another counterparty. The overwhelming majority of AIG\\'s derivatives activities are conducted through AIGFP and AIGTG, thus permitting AIG to participate in the derivatives dealer market acting primarily as principal. In these derivative operations, AIG structures agreements which generally allow its counterparties to enter into transactions with respect to changes in interest and exchange rates, securities\\' prices and certain commodities and financial or commodity indices. AIG\\'s customers such as corporations, financial institutions, multinational organizations, sovereign entities, government agencies and municipalities use derivatives to hedge their own market exposures. For example, a futures, forward or option contract can be used to protect the customers\\' assets or liabilities against price fluctuations. A counterparty may default on any obligation to AIG, including a derivative contract. Credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and/or carrying trading and investment positions. Credit risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to AIG. To help manage this risk, the credit departments of AIGFP and AIGTG operate within the guidelines set by the AIG Credit Risk Committee. This committee establishes the credit policy, sets limits for counterparties and provides limits for derivative transactions with counterparties having different credit ratings. In addition to credit ratings, this committee takes into account other factors, including the industry and country of the counterparty. Transactions which fall outside these pre-established guidelines require the approval of the AIG Credit Risk Committee. It is also AIG\\'s policy to establish reserves for potential credit impairment when necessary. AIGFP and AIGTG determine the credit quality of each of their counterparties taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized statistical rating organizations. If it is determined that a counterparty requires credit enhancement, then one or more enhancement techniques will be used. Examples of such enhancement techniques include letters of credit, guarantees, collateral credit triggers and credit derivatives and margin agreements. A significant majority of AIGFP\\'s transactions are contracted and documented under ISDA Master Agreements. Management believes that such agreements provide for legally enforceable set-off in the event of default. Also, under such agreements, in connection with a counterparty desiring to terminate a contract prior to maturity, AIGFP may be permitted to set-off its receivables from that counterparty against AIGFP\\'s payables to that same counterparty arising out of all included transactions. Excluding regulated exchange transactions, AIGTG, whenever possible, enters into netting agreements with its counterparties which are similar in effect to those discussed above. Discussions with respect to AIGFP\\'s and AIGTG\\'s counterpart credit quality, fair value source and notional amounts follow. COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY:\\nThe following tables provide the counterparty credit quality amounts of AIGFP\\'s and AIGTG\\'s derivatives transactions at December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000. The net replacement value most closely represents the net credit risk to AIGFP or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss after the application of the aforementioned strategies, netting under ISDA Master Agreements and applying collateral held. Subsequent to the application of such credit enhancements, the net exposure to credit risk or the net replacement value of all interest rate, currency and equity swaps, swaptions and forward commitments approximated $10.84 billion at December 31, 2001 and $9.51 billion at December 31, 2000. The net replacement value for futures and forward contracts approximated $64 million at December 31, 2001 and $204 million at December 31, 2000.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\\nIn addition to its role as derivatives dealer through AIGFP and AIGTG, AIG and its subsidiaries, including its insurance subsidiaries, use derivatives primarily to minimize AIG's asset-liability exposure and foreign currency and interest rate exposures. These transactions are generally executed with AIGFP and AIGTG as counterparty, who in turn hedge these transactions in the market place. Thus, AIGFP and AIGTG assume the credit risk exposure. AIG also uses derivatives to help match assets and liabilities in several of its businesses, including its insurance operations. For example, AIG can use currency and interest rate swaps to convert foreign-currency investment contract liabilities into US dollar-based exposures. Thus, these liabilities are more properly matched with US dollar assets. In life insurance, AIG uses swaps to reduce the mismatch between long dated life insurance liabilities and shorter dated local currency assets. Swaps also enable AIG to balance its asset and liability durations in consumer finance operations. AIG's Derivatives Review Committee provides an independent review of any proposed derivative transaction. The committee examines, among other things, the nature and purpose of the derivative transaction, its potential credit exposure, if any, and the estimated benefits. This committee does not review those derivative transactions entered into by AIGFP and AIGTG for their own accounts.

(See also the discussion on master netting agreements above.)\\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS\\nIn June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 \"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\" (FASB 133). In June 2000, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138 \"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133\" (collectively, FASB 133). FASB 133 requires AIG to recognize all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The financial statement recognition of the change in the fair value of a derivative depends on a number of factors, including the intended use of the derivative and the extent to which it is effective as part of a hedge transaction. The changes in fair value of the derivative transactions of AIGFP and AIGTG are currently presented, in all material respects, as a component of AIG\\'s operating income. The discussion below relates to the derivative activities of AIG other than those of AIGFP and AIGTG. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, AIG designates the derivative as: (1) a hedge of the subsequent changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (\"fair value\" hedge); (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction, or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (\"cash flow\" hedge); or (3) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Fair value and cash flow hedges may involve foreign currencies (\"foreign currency hedges\"). The gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative that is designated, qualifies and is highly effective as a fair value hedge is recorded in current period earnings, along with the loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative that is designated, qualifies and is highly effective as a cash flow hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows. The gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative that is designated, qualifies and is highly effective as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustments account within other comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of derivatives used for other than the above hedging activities are reported in current period earnings. AIG documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedge items, as well as its risk-management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet, or specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. AIG also assesses, both at the hedge\\'s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. In accordance with the transition provisions of FASB 133, AIG recorded in its consolidated income statement for 2001 a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment loss of $6 million. This loss represents the net fair value of all previously unrecorded derivative instruments as of January 1, 2001, net of tax and after the application of hedge accounting. AIG also recorded in its consolidated statement of comprehensive income for 2001 a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment gain of $150 million. This gain represents the increase in other comprehensive income, net of taxes, arising from recognizing the fair value of all derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments, and to a lesser extent, hedging instruments used to hedge net investments in foreign operations. American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nAIG (excluding its two trading operations, AIGFP and AIGTG) uses derivative instruments (principally swap and forward contracts) to minimize AIG\\'s asset-liability exposure and foreign currency and interest rate exposures. These risks arise primarily from available-for-sale fixed income securities, debt, and policyholder account balance liabilities associated with guaranteed investment contracts.'),\n",

During 2001, there were no hedges that were discontinued or otherwise no longer qualify as hedges under FASB 133. With respect to both fair value hedges and cash flow hedges, hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for 2001. During 2001, there were minor reclassifications to earnings from other comprehensive income under cash flow hedge accounting. These reclassifications were connected to programs of synthetically converting certain investment securities, debt issuances or policyholder account balance liabilities associated with guaranteed investment contracts, from a floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate. As at December 31, 2001, the maximum amount of net derivative losses to be reclassified into net income within the next twelve months is insignificant. The maximum length of time over which future cash flows are hedged is approximately 16 years. In addition to hedging activities, AIG also uses derivative instruments with respect to investment operations, which include, among other things, writing option contracts, and purchasing investments with embedded derivatives, such as equity linked notes and convertible bonds. All changes in the market value of these derivatives are recorded in earnings. AIG bifurcates an embedded derivative where: (1) the economic characteristics of the embedded instruments are not clearly and closely related to those of the remaining components of the financial instrument; and (2) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument meets the definition of a derivative under FASB 133. In accordance with the transition provisions of FASB 133, AIG transferred bonds in the held to maturity, at amortized cost category into the bonds available for sale, at market value category at January 1, 2001. The amortized cost of the bonds transferred was $11.53 billion.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\n(a) PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: On August 29, 2001 American General Corporation (AGC), was acquired by American International Group, Inc. (AIG). In connection with the acquisition, AIG issued approximately 290 million shares of its common stock in exchange for all the outstanding common stock of AGC based on an exchange ratio of 0.5790 of a share of AIG common stock for each share of AGC common stock. The acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests and the accompanying financial statements have been prepared to retroactively combine AGC's financial statements with AIG's financial statements for all periods presented. All of the share information included herein reflects the application of the exchange ratio to the number of shares of AGC common stock outstanding at the relevant times rather than the number of shares of AIG common stock actually issued or outstanding at such times. In addition, AGC convertible preferred stock has been included based on its AGC common stock equivalent in the restated capital accounts. The following is a reconciliation of the individual company results to the combined results for 2000 and 1999:\\nOn January 1, 1999, SunAmerica Inc. merged with and into AIG. AIG issued 187.5 million shares of its common stock in exchange for all the outstanding common stock and Class B stock of SunAmerica Inc., based on an exchange ratio of 0.855 shares of AIG common stock for each share of SunAmerica Inc. stock. The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests. AIG subsidiaries write property, casualty, marine, life and financial lines insurance in approximately 130 countries and jurisdictions. Certain of AIG's foreign subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements report on a fiscal year ending November 30. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AIG and its majority owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. HSB Group, Inc. (HSB) was acquired on November 22, 2000 and consolidated into AIG's financial statements during the fourth quarter of 2000. This acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. (b) BASIS OF PRESENTATION: The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\"),\n",

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\\nPolicy acquisition costs for traditional life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period of the policy. Policy acquisition costs and policy initiation costs related to universal life and investment-type products (non-traditional products) are deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts. Estimated gross profits are composed of net interest income, net realized investment gains and losses, variable annuity fees, surrender charges and direct administrative expenses. The deferred acquisition costs with respect to non-traditional products are adjusted with respect to estimated gross profits as a result of changes in the net unrealized gains or losses on debt and equity securities available for sale. That is, as debt and equity securities available for sale are carried at aggregate fair value, an adjustment is made to deferred policy acquisition costs equal to the change in amortization that would have been recorded if such securities had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields. The change in this adjustment, net of tax, is included with the change in net unrealized gains/losses on debt and equity securities available for sale that is credited or charged directly to comprehensive income. Deferred policy acquisition costs have been decreased by $177 million at December 31, 2001 and increased by $222 million at December 31, 2000 for this adjustment. (See Note 4.)\\nThe liabilities for future policy benefits and policyholders\\' contract deposits are established using assumptions described in Note 6. Financial Services Operations: AIG participates in the derivatives dealer market conducting, primarily as principal, an interest rate, currency, equity and credit derivative products business. AIG also enters into structured transactions, including long-dated forward foreign exchange contracts, option transactions, liquidity facilities and investment agreements, and invests in a diversified portfolio of securities. AIG engages in market making and trading activities, as principal, in foreign exchange, interest rates and precious and base metals. AIG owns inventories in the commodities in which it trades and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the use of swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts. AIG, as lessor, leases flight equipment principally under operating leases. Accordingly, income is recognized over the life of the lease as rentals become receivable under the provisions of the lease or, in the case of leases with varying payments, under the straight-line method over the noncancelable term of the lease. In certain cases, leases provide for additional payments contingent on usage. AIG is also a remarketer of flight equipment for its own account and for airlines and financial institutions, and provides, for a fee, fleet management services to certain third-party operators. AIG\\'s revenues from such operations consist of net gains on sales of flight equipment and commissions. AIG provides a wide variety of consumer finance products, including mortgages, retail sales finance and credit related insurance. Retirement Savings & Asset Management Operations: AIG\\'s retirement savings & asset management operations offer a wide variety of investment vehicles and services, including variable annuities, mutual funds and investment asset management. Such products and services are offered to individuals and institutions both domestically and internationally. The fees generated with respect to retirement savings & asset management operations are recognized as revenues when earned. Costs incurred in the sale of variable annuities and mutual funds are deferred and subsequently amortized. With respect to variable annuities, acquisition costs are amortized in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the variable annuity contracts. With respect to the sale of mutual funds, acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the funds obtained. (c) NON-CASH TRANSACTIONS: During 2001, 2000, and 1999, AIG issued 291.6 million, 17.8 million and 187.5 million common shares in connection with acquisitions, respectively. (d) INVESTMENTS IN FIXED MATURITIES AND EQUITY SECURITIES: Where AIG may not have the positive intent to hold bonds and preferred stocks until maturity, these securities are considered to be available for sale and carried at current market values. Interest income with respect to fixed maturity securities is accrued currently. Fixed maturities held to maturity, at amortized cost, were transferred to bonds available for sale, at market value, as of January 1, 2001 as permitted and in accordance with the transition provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 \"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\" (FASB 133). (See Notes 1(x) and 8(d).)\\nIncluded in the bonds available for sale are collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). Premiums and discounts arising from the purchase of CMOs are treated as yield adjustments over their estimated lives. Bond trading securities are carried at current market values, as it is AIG\\'s intention to sell these securities in the near term. Common and non-redeemable preferred stocks are carried at current market values. Dividend income is generally recognized when receivable. Unrealized gains and losses from investments in equity securities and fixed maturities available for sale are reflected as a separate component of comprehensive income, net of deferred income taxes in capital funds currently. Unrealized gains and losses from investments in trading securities are reflected in income currently. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\\nRealized capital gains and losses are determined principally by specific identification. Where declines in values of securities below cost or amortized cost are considered to be other than temporary, a charge is reflected in income for the difference between cost or amortized cost and estimated net fair value. (e) MORTGAGE LOANS ON REAL ESTATE, POLICY AND COLLATERAL LOANS -- NET: Mortgage loans on real estate, policy loans and collateral loans are carried at unpaid principal balances. Interest income on such loans is accrued currently. Impairment of mortgage loans on real estate and collateral loans is based upon certain risk factors and when collection of all amounts due under the contractual term is not probable. This impairment is generally measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan\\'s effective interest rate subject to the fair value of underlying collateral. Interest income on such loans is recognized as cash is received. There is no allowance for policy loans, as these loans serve to reduce the death benefit paid when the death claim is made and the balances are effectively collateralized by the cash surrender value of the policy. (f) FLIGHT EQUIPMENT: Flight equipment is stated at cost.'),\n",

Normal maintenance and repairs, airframe and engine overhauls and compliance with return conditions of flight equipment on lease are provided by and paid for by the lessee. Under the provisions of most leases for certain airframe and engine overhauls, the lessee is reimbursed for costs incurred up to but not exceeding contingent rentals paid to AIG by the lessee. AIG provides a charge to income for such reimbursements based upon the expected reimbursements during the life of the lease. Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line basis to a residual value of approximately 15 percent over the estimated useful lives of the related assets but not exceeding 25 years. AIG monitors the global aircraft market and the values of various types and models of aircraft within that market relative to the values of its own fleet. If events or circumstances were such that the carrying amount of AIG's aircraft might be impaired, AIG would determine if such impairment existed and recognize such impairment. This caption also includes deposits for aircraft to be purchased. At the time the assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the related accounts and the difference, net of proceeds, is recorded as a gain or loss. (g) SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE, AT MARKET VALUE: These securities are held to meet long term investment objectives and are accounted for as available for sale, carried at current market values and recorded on a trade date basis. Unrealized gains and losses from valuing these securities and any related hedges are reflected in capital funds currently, net of any related deferred income taxes. When the underlying security is sold, the realized gain or loss resulting from the hedging derivative transaction is recognized in income in that same period as the realized gain or loss of the hedged security. (h) FINANCE RECEIVABLES: Finance charges are recognized as revenue using the interest method. Revenue ceases to be accrued when contractual payments are not received for four consecutive months for loans and retail sales contracts, and for six months for revolving retail accounts and private label receivables. Extension fees, late charges, and prepayment penalties are recognized as revenue when received. Direct costs of originating loans, net of non-refundable points and fees, are deferred and included in the carrying amount of the related loans. The amount deferred is recognized as an adjustment to finance charge revenues, using the interest method over the lesser of the contractual term or the expected life based on prepayment experience. If loans are prepaid, any remaining deferral is charged or credited to revenue. Foreclosure proceedings are initiated on real estate loans when four monthly installments are past due and these loans are charged off at foreclosure. All other finance receivables are charged off when minimal or no collections have been made for six months. The allowance for finance receivable losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to absorb anticipated credit losses in the existing portfolio. The portfolio is periodically evaluated on a pooled basis and considers factors such as economic conditions, portfolio composition, and loss and delinquency experience in the evaluation of the allowance. (i) TRADING SECURITIES, AT MARKET VALUE: Trading securities are held to meet short term investment objectives, including hedging securities. These securities are recorded on a trade date basis and carried at current market values. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in income currently. (j) SPOT COMMODITIES, AT MARKET VALUE: Spot commodities are carried at current market values and are recorded on a trade date basis. The exposure to market risk may be reduced through the use of forwards, futures and option contracts. Unrealized gains and losses of both commodities and any derivative transactions are reflected in income currently. (k) UNREALIZED GAIN AND UNREALIZED LOSS ON INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS, OPTIONS AND FORWARD TRANSACTIONS: Interest rate swaps, currency swaps, equity swaps, swaptions, options and forward transactions are accounted for as contractual commitments recorded on a trade date basis and are carried at current market values or estimated fair values when market values are not available. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in income currently. Estimated fair values are based on the use of valuation models that utilize, among other things, current interest, foreign exchange and volatility rates. AIG Financial Products Corp. and its subsidiaries (AIGFP) attempts to secure reliable and independent current market prices, such as published exchange prices, external subscription services' prices such as\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\\nBloomberg or Reuters or third party broker quotes for use in these models. When such prices are not available, AIGFP uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions. These valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows of these transactions and reflect market and credit risk. The portfolio's discounted cash flows are evaluated with reference to current market conditions, maturities within the portfolio and other relevant factors. Based upon this evaluation, it is determined what offsetting transactions, if any, are necessary to reduce the market risk of the portfolio. AIG manages its market risk with a variety of transactions, including swaps, trading securities, futures and forward contracts and other transactions as appropriate. Because of the limited liquidity of some of these instruments, the recorded values of these transactions may be different than the values that might be realized if AIG were to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes that such differences are not significant to the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Such differences would be immediately recognized when the transactions are sold or closed out prior to maturity. (l) TRADING ASSETS AND TRADING LIABILITIES: Trading assets and trading liabilities include option premiums paid and received and receivables from and payables to counterparties which relate to unrealized gains and losses on futures, forwards and options and balances due from and due to clearing brokers and exchanges. Futures, forwards and options purchased and written are accounted for as contractual commitments on a trade date basis and are carried at fair values. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in income currently. The fair values of futures contracts are based on closing exchange quotations. Commodity forward transactions are carried at fair values derived from dealer quotations and underlying commodity exchange quotations. For long dated forward transactions, where there are no dealer or exchange quotations, fair values are derived using internally developed valuation methodologies based on available market information. Options are carried at fair values based on the use of valuation models that utilize, among other things, current interest or commodity rates and foreign exchange and volatility rates, as applicable. (m) SECURITIES PURCHASED (SOLD) UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL (REPURCHASE), AT CONTRACT VALUE: Purchases of securities under agreements to resell and sales of securities under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized lending transactions and are recorded at their contracted resale or repurchase amounts, plus accrued interest. Generally, it is AIG's policy to take possession of or obtain a security interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell. AIG minimizes the credit risk that counterparties to transactions might be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations by monitoring customer credit exposure and collateral value and generally requiring additional collateral to be deposited with AIG when deemed necessary. AIG also enters into dollar roll agreements. These are agreements to sell mortgage-backed securities and to repurchase substantially the same securities at a specified price and date in the future. The dollar rolls are accounted for as collateralized financings and the repurchase obligation is a component of other liabilities. At December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, there were no dollar rolls outstanding. (n) OTHER INVESTED ASSETS: Other invested assets consist primarily of investments by AIG's insurance operations in joint ventures and partnerships, invested collateral with respect to AIG's securities lending program and other investments not classified elsewhere herein. The joint ventures and partnerships are carried at equity or cost depending on the equity ownership position. AIG's insurance operations lend their securities and primarily take cash as collateral with respect to the securities lent. Income earned is recorded in the respective insurance operations net investment income. Other investments are carried at cost or market values depending upon the nature of the underlying assets. Unrealized gains and losses from the revaluation of those investments carried at fair values are reflected in comprehensive income, net of any related deferred income taxes or realized capital gains or losses. (o) REINSURANCE ASSETS: Reinsurance assets include the balances due from both reinsurance and insurance companies under the terms of AIG's reinsurance agreements for paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses, ceded unearned premiums and ceded future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and benefits paid and unpaid. It also includes funds held under reinsurance treaties. Amounts related to paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses with respect to these reinsurance agreements are substantially collateralized. (p) INVESTMENTS IN PARTIALLY-OWNED COMPANIES: The equity method of accounting is used for AIG's investment in companies in which AIG's ownership interest approximates twenty but is not greater than fifty percent (minority-owned companies). At December 31, 2001, AIG's significant investments in partially-owned companies included its 24.4 percent interest in IPC Holdings, Ltd. and its 23.4 percent interest in Allied World Assurance Holdings, Ltd. This balance sheet caption also includes investments in less significant partially-owned companies and in certain minor majority-owned subsidiaries. The amounts of dividends received from unconsolidated entities owned less than 50 percent were $3 million, $3 million and $13 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\\nrespectively. The undistributed earnings of unconsolidated entities owned less than 50 percent was $55 million as of December 31, 2001. (q) REAL ESTATE AND OTHER FIXED ASSETS: The costs of buildings and furniture and equipment are depreciated principally on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (maximum of 40 years for buildings and 10 years for furniture and equipment). Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred; expenditures for betterments are capitalized and depreciated. From time to time, AIG assesses the carrying value of its real estate relative to the market values of real estate within the specific local area. At December 31, 2001, there were no impairments. (r) SEPARATE AND VARIABLE ACCOUNTS: Separate and variable accounts represent funds for which investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to the policyholders who predominantly bear the investment risk. Each account has specific investment objectives, and the assets are carried at market value. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims which arise out of any other business of AIG. The liabilities for these accounts are equal to the account assets. (s) SECURITIES AND SPOT COMMODITIES SOLD BUT NOT YET PURCHASED, AT MARKET VALUE: Securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased represent sales of securities and spot commodities not owned at the time of sale. The obligations arising from such transactions are recorded on a trade date basis and carried at the respective current market values or current commodity prices.\"),\n",

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\\nThe computation of earnings per share for December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was as follows:\\n(x) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS: In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB 133. In June 2000, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138 \"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities -- an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133\" (collectively, FASB 133). FASB 133 requires AIG to recognize all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The financial statement recognition of the change in the fair value of a derivative depends on a number of factors, including the intended use of the derivative and the extent to which it is effective as part of a hedge transaction. The changes in fair value of the derivative transactions of AIGFP and AIG Trading Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (AIGTG) are currently presented, in all material respects, as a component of AIG\\'s operating income. The discussion below relates to the derivative activities of AIG other than those of AIGFP and AIGTG. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, AIG designates the derivative as: (1) a hedge of the subsequent changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (\"fair value\" hedge); (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction, or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (\"cash flow\" hedge); or (3) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Fair value and cash flow hedges may involve foreign currencies (\"foreign currency hedges\"). The gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative that is designated, qualifies and is highly effective as a fair value hedge is recorded in current period earnings, along with the loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative that is designated, qualifies and is highly effective as a cash flow hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows. The gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative that is designated, qualifies and is highly effective as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustments account within other comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of derivatives used for other than the above hedging activities are reported in current period earnings. AIG documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet, or specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. AIG also assesses, both at the hedge\\'s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. In accordance with the transition provisions of FASB 133, AIG recorded in its consolidated income statement for 2001 a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment loss of $6 million. This loss represents the net fair value of all previous unrecorded derivative instruments as of January 1, 2001, net of tax and after the application of hedge accounting. AIG also recorded in its consolidated statement of comprehensive income for 2001 a cumulative effect of an accounting change\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\\nadjustment gain of $150 million. This gain represents the increase in other comprehensive income, net of taxes, arising from recognizing the fair value of all derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments, and to a lesser extent, hedging instruments used to hedge net investments in foreign operations. AIG (excluding its two trading operations, AIGFP and AIGTG) uses derivative instruments (principally swap and forward contracts) to minimize AIG\\'s asset-liability exposure and foreign currency and interest rate exposures. These risks arise primarily from available-for-sale fixed income securities, debt, and policyholder account balance liabilities associated with guaranteed investment contracts.'),\n",

During 2001, there were no hedges that were discontinued or otherwise no longer qualify as hedges under FASB 133. With respect to both fair value hedges and cash flow hedges, hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for 2001. During 2001, there were minor reclassifications to earnings from other comprehensive income under cash flow hedge accounting. These reclassifications were connected to programs of synthetically converting certain investment securities, debt issuances or policyholder account balance liabilities associated with guaranteed investment contracts, from a floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate. As at December 31, 2001, the maximum amount of net derivative losses to be reclassified into net income within the next twelve months is insignificant. The maximum length of time over which future cash flows are hedged is approximately 16 years. In addition to hedging activities, AIG also uses derivative instruments with respect to investment operations, which include, among other things, writing option contracts, and purchasing investments with embedded derivatives, such as equity linked notes and convertible bonds. All changes in the market value of these derivatives are recorded in earnings. AIG bifurcates an embedded derivative where: (1) the economic characteristics of the embedded instruments are not clearly and closely related to those of the remaining components of the financial instrument; and (2) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument meets the definition of a derivative under FASB 133. In accordance with the transition provisions of FASB 133, AIG transferred bonds in the held to maturity, at amortized cost category into the bonds available for sale, at market value category at January 1, 2001. The amortized cost of the bonds transferred was $11.53 billion. The unrealized appreciation, net of deferred tax expense was approximately $339 million at the date of transfer and was recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting change within other comprehensive income. Under the provisions of FASB 133, such a transfer does not affect AIG\\'s intent nor its ability to hold current or future bonds to their maturity. In January 2001, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF 99-20, \"Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets.\" EITF 99-20 provides guidance on the calculation of interest income and the recognition of impairments related to beneficial interests held in an investment portfolio. Beneficial interests are investments that represent rights to receive specified cash flows from a pool of underlying assets (i.e., collateralized debt obligations). In accordance with the transition provisions of EITF 99-20, AIG recorded in its consolidated income statement for 2001 a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment loss of $130 million ($200 million before tax). In June 2001, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 141 \"Business Combinations\" (FASB 141). FASB 141 requires AIG, among other things, to apply the purchase method of accounting for all acquisitions initiated after June 30, 2001. In June 2001, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142 \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\" (FASB 142). FASB 142 requires AIG to discontinue the amortization of goodwill in its consolidated income statement. However, FASB 142 requires goodwill to be subject to an assessment of impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that a possible impairment has occurred. FASB 142 is effective for AIG for the year commencing January 1, 2002. AIG is currently evaluating the impact of the impairment provisions of FASB 142, and believes that the impact on its results of operations and financial condition will not be significant. 2.'),\n",

In addition, Revenue Agent's Reports proposing to assess additional taxes for the years ended September 30, 1993 and 1994 have been issued to SunAmerica. Such proposed assessments relate to years prior to AIG's acquisition of SunAmerica. Letters of Protest contesting the proposed assessments have been filed with the IRS. It is management's belief that there are substantial arguments in support of the positions taken by AIG and SunAmerica in their Letters of Protest. AIG also believes that any changes in its tax obligations resulting from these examinations will not be significant to AIG's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. All AIG, SunAmerica and AGC consolidated tax returns are audited by the IRS. Although the final outcome of any issues raised in connection with these audits is uncertain, AIG believes that the ultimate liability, including interest, will be immaterial to AIG's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

(d) The liability for policyholders' contract deposits has been established based on the following assumptions:\\n(i) Interest rates credited on deferred annuities, which vary by territory and year of issuance, range from 1.5 percent to 9.2 percent. Current declared interest rates are generally guaranteed to remain in effect for a period of one year though some are guaranteed for longer periods. Withdrawal charges generally range from zero percent to 20.0 percent grading to zero over a period of zero to 10 years. (ii) Domestically, GICs have market value withdrawal provisions for any funds withdrawn other than benefit responsive payments. Interest rates credited generally range from 2.0 percent to 8.7 percent. The vast majority of these GICs mature within 10 years. Overseas, interest rates credited on GICs generally range from 2.5 percent to 7.3 percent and maturities range from 1 to 5 years.

The capital securities are not redeemable prior to July 15, 2007 and are mandatorily redeemable upon the maturity of the debt securities on July 15, 2027 or the earlier redemption of the debt securities. AIG has issued a guarantee of the obligations of HSB, which together with the terms of the debt securities, the guarantee of HSB with respect to the capital securities, the indenture and the trust agreement with respect to the trust provide a full and unconditional guarantee of payments due on the capital securities. The trust is accounted for as a wholly owned subsidiary of AIG. The debt securities issued to the trust and the common securities issued by the trust to HSB are eliminated in the consolidated balance sheet. 11. CAPITAL FUNDS\\n(a) AIG parent depends on its subsidiaries for cash flow in the form of loans, advances and dividends. AIG\\'s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions on the amount of dividends which can be remitted to AIG parent. These restrictions vary by state. For example, unless permitted by the New York Superintendent of Insurance, general insurance companies domiciled in New York may not pay dividends to shareholders which in any twelve month period exceed the lesser of 10 percent of the company\\'s statutory policyholders\\' surplus or 100 percent of its \"adjusted net investment income\", as defined. Generally, less severe restrictions applicable to both general and life insurance companies exist in most of the other states in which AIG\\'s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled. Certain foreign jurisdictions have restrictions which generally cause only a temporary delay in the remittance of dividends. There are also various local restrictions limiting cash loans and advances to AIG by its subsidiaries. Largely as a result of the restrictions, approximately 67 percent of consolidated capital funds were restricted from immediate transfer to AIG parent at December 31, 2001. (b) At December 31, 2001, there were 6,000,000 shares of AIG\\'s $5 par value serial preferred stock authorized, issuable in series. (c) The common stock activity for the three years ended December 31, 2001 was as follows:\\n(a) Outstanding shares have been adjusted to reflect the conversion of all outstanding AGC shares by converting each outstanding share of AGC to 0.5790 shares of AIG. (b) Primarily shares issued to AIG and subsidiaries as part of stock split effected as stock dividend and conversion of SunAmerica Inc. non- transferrable Class B stock to common stock. Common stock increased and retained earnings decreased $2.04 billion in 2000 and $818 million in 1999 as a result of common stock splits in the form of 50 percent and 25 percent common stock dividends paid July 28, 2000 and July 30, 1999, respectively. 12.'),\n",

In addition, AIG guarantees various obligations of certain subsidiaries. (a) Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend subject to certain conditions. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses and typically require payment of a fee. These commitments approximated\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\\n12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (continued)\\n$300 million and $500 million for December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. AIG uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. AIG evaluates each counterparty's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by AIG upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. (b) AIG and certain of its subsidiaries become parties to financial instruments with market risk resulting from both dealer and end user activities and to reduce currency, interest rate, equity and commodity exposures. To the extent those instruments are carried at their estimated fair value, the elements of currency, interest rate, equity and commodity risks are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. Collateral is required, at the discretion of AIG, on certain transactions based on the creditworthiness of the counterparty. (c) AIGFP becomes a party to derivative financial instruments in the normal course of its business and to reduce its currency, interest rate and equity exposures. Interest rate, currency and equity risks related to such instruments are reflected in the consolidated financial statements to the extent these instruments are carried at a market or a fair value, whichever is appropriate. The recorded estimated fair values of such instruments may be different than the values that might be realized if AIGFP were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIGFP, in the ordinary course of its operations and as principal, structures derivative transactions to meet the needs of investors who may be seeking to hedge certain aspects of such investors' operations. AIGFP may also enter into derivative transactions for its own account. Such derivative transactions include interest rate, currency and equity swaps, swaptions and forward commitments. Interest rate swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. AIGFP typically becomes a principal in the exchange of interest payments between the parties and, therefore, may be exposed to loss, if counterparties default. Currency and equity swaps are similar to interest rate swaps, but involves the exchange of specific currency, equity securities, or equity indices. Also, they may involve the exchange of principal amounts at the beginning and end of the transaction. Swaptions are options where the holder has the right but not the obligation to enter into a swap transaction or cancel an existing swap transaction. At December 31, 2001, the notional principal amount of the sum of the swap pays and receives approximated $634.3 billion, primarily related to interest rate swaps of approximately $436.7 billion. The following tables provide the contractual and notional amounts of derivatives transactions of AIGFP at December 31, 2001. The notional amounts used to express the extent of involvement in swap transactions represent a standard of measurement of the volume of swaps business of AIGFP. Notional amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and it may not necessarily be recorded on the balance sheet. Notional amounts represent those amounts used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received, except for certain contracts such as currency swaps. The timing and the amount of cash flows relating to AIGFP's foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures and options contracts are determined by each of the respective contractual agreements. The following table presents AIGFP's derivatives portfolio by maturity and type of derivative at December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000:\\n*Notional amount is not representative of either market risk or credit risk\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\n12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (continued)\\nFutures and forward contracts are contracts for delivery of foreign currencies or financial indices in which the seller/ purchaser agrees to make/take delivery at a specified future date of a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield. Risks arise as a result of movements in current market prices from contracted prices and the potential inability of counterparties to meet their obligations under the contracts. At December 31, 2001, the contractual amount of AIGFP's futures and forward contracts approximated $68.0 billion. The following table presents AIGFP's futures and forward contracts portfolio by maturity and type of derivative at December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000:\\nAIGFP utilizes various credit enhancements, including collateral, credit triggers and credit derivatives to reduce the credit exposure relating to these off-balance sheet financial instruments. AIGFP requires credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties and the transaction's size and maturity. In addition, AIGFP's derivative transactions are generally documented under ISDA Master Agreements. Management believes that such agreements provide for legally enforceable set-off and close out netting of exposures to specific counterparties. Under such agreements, in connection with an early termination of a transaction, AIGFP is permitted to set-off its receivables from a counterparty against its payables to the same counterparty arising out of all included transactions. As a result, the net replacement value represents the net sum of estimated positive fair values after the application of such strategies, agreements and collateral held. Subsequent to the application of such credit enhancements, the net exposure to credit risk or the net replacement value of all interest rate, currency, and equity swaps, swaptions and forward commitments approximated $10.84 billion at December 31, 2001 and $9.51 billion at December 31, 2000. The net replacement value for futures and forward contracts approximated $64 million at December 31, 2001 and $204 million at December 31, 2000. The net replacement value most closely represents the net credit risk to AIGFP or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss. AIGFP independently evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties, taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized statistical rating organizations. In addition, AIGFP's credit approval process involves pre-set counterparty, country and industry credit exposure limits and, for particularly credit intensive transactions, obtaining approval from AIG's Credit Risk Committee. The average credit rating of AIGFP's counterparties as a whole (as measured by AIGFP) is equivalent to AA. The maximum potential loss will increase or decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions. AIGFP determines counterparty credit quality by reference to ratings from independent rating agencies or internal analysis. At December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, the counterparty credit quality by derivative product with respect to the net replacement value of AIGFP's derivatives portfolio was as follows:\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (continued)\\nAt December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, the counterparty breakdown by industry with respect to the net replacement value of AIGFP's derivatives portfolio was as follows:\\nSecurities sold, but not yet purchased represent obligations of AIGFP to deliver specified securities at their contracted prices, and thereby create a liability to repurchase the securities in the market at prevailing prices. AIGFP monitors and controls its risk exposure on a daily basis through financial, credit and legal reporting systems and, accordingly, believes that it has in place effective procedures for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which it is subject. Management is not aware of any potentially significant counterparty defaults. Commissions, transaction and other fees for the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 from AIGFP's operations were $1.18 billion, $1.06 billion and $737 million, respectively. (d) AIGTG becomes a party to derivative financial instruments in the normal course of its business and to reduce its currency, interest rate and commodity exposures. Futures and forward contracts are contracts for delivery of foreign currencies, commodities or financial indices in which the seller/purchaser agrees to make/take delivery at a specified future date of a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield. Risks arise as a result of movements in current market prices from contracted prices and the potential inability of counterparties to meet their obligations under the contracts. Options are contracts that allow the holder of the option to purchase or sell the underlying commodity, currency or index at a specified price and within, or at, a specified period of time. Risks arise as a result of movements in current market prices from contracted prices, and the potential inability of the counterparties to meet their obligations under the contracts. As a writer of options, AIGTG generally receives an option premium and then manages the risk of any unfavorable change in the value of the underlying commodity, currency or index. At December 31, 2001, the contractual amount of AIGTG's futures, forward and option contracts approximated $475.4 billion. The following table provides the contractual and notional amounts and credit exposure, if applicable, by maturity and type of derivative of AIGTG's derivatives portfolio at December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000. The gross replacement values presented represent the sum of the estimated positive fair values of all of AIGTG's derivatives contracts at December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000. These values do not represent the credit risk to AIGTG. Net replacement values presented represent the net sum of estimated positive fair values after the application of legally enforceable master closeout netting agreements and collateral held. The net replacement values most closely represent the net credit risk to AIGTG or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss within a product category. At December 31, 2001, the net replacement value of AIGTG's futures, forward and option contracts and interest rate and currency swaps approximated $3.1 billion.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (continued)\\nAIGTG limits its risks by holding offsetting positions. In addition, AIGTG monitors and controls its risk exposures through various monitoring systems which evaluate AIGTG\\'s market and credit risks, and through credit approvals and limits. At December 31, 2001, AIGTG did not have a significant concentration of credit risk from either an individual counterparty or group of counterparties. AIG has issued unconditional guarantees with respect to the prompt payment, when due, of all present and future obligations and liabilities of AIGFP and AIGTG arising from transactions entered into by AIGFP and AIGTG. (e) As a component of its asset and liability management strategy, SunAmerica utilizes swap agreements to match more closely the cash flows of its assets to the cash flows of its liabilities. SunAmerica uses these swap agreements to hedge against the risk of interest rate changes. At December 31, 2001, SunAmerica\\'s swap agreements had an aggregate notional principal amount of $17.90 billion. These agreements mature in various years through 2031. For investment purposes, SunAmerica has entered into various total return agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $26 million (the \"notional amount\") at December 31, 2001. The total return agreements effectively exchange a fixed rate of interest (the \"payment amount\") on the notional amount for the coupon income plus or minus the increase or decrease in the fair value of specified non-investment grade bonds (the \"bonds\"). SunAmerica is exposed to potential loss with respect to credit risk on the underlying non-investment grade bonds and fair value risk resulting from the payment amount and any depreciation in the aggregate fair value of the bonds below the notional amount. SunAmerica is also exposed to potential credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the investment grade rated counterparty with respect to any increase in the aggregate market value of the bonds above the notional amount. No collateral is held or pledged to support these agreements.'),\n",

AIG guarantees the payment obligations of SunAmerica under such agreements. (f) AGC and certain of its subsidiaries have entered into various interest rate and currency swap agreements, treasury rate lock agreements and options to enter into interest rate swap agreements. AGC uses these agreements to hedge its exposure to interest rate changes and currency rate fluctuations that are associated with investment operations and/or anticipated debt issuances. At December 31, 2001, AGC's swap agreements with respect to investment operations had an aggregate notional amount of $331 million; AGC's swap agreements with respect to debt had an aggregate notional amount of $800 million, of which $400 million was with AIGFP. There were no treasury rate lock agreements outstanding at December 31, 2001. The impact of AGC's derivatives on AIG's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity was insignificant. (g) At December 31, 2001, ILFC had committed to purchase 551 aircraft deliverable from 2002 through 2010 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $32.1 billion and had options to purchase 49 aircraft deliverable from 2002 through 2008 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $3.0 billion. ILFC will be required to find customers for any aircraft presently on order and any aircraft to be ordered, and it must arrange financing for portions of the purchase price of such equipment. (h) AIG and its subsidiaries, in common with the insurance industry in general, are subject to litigation, including claims for punitive damages, in the normal course of their business. AIG does not believe that such litigation will have a material effect on its operating results and financial condition. AIG continues to receive claims asserting injuries from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites (hereinafter collectively referred to as environmental claims) and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a difficult process, as these claims, which emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years, cannot be estimated by conventional reserving techniques. Asbestos and environmental claims development is affected by factors such as inconsistent court resolutions, the broadening of the intent of policies and scope of coverage and increasing number of new claims. AIG and other industry members have and will continue to litigate the broadening judicial interpretation of policy coverage and the liability issues. If the courts continue in the future to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage, as they have in the past, additional liabilities would emerge for amounts in excess of reserves held. This emergence cannot now be reasonably estimated, but could have a material impact on AIG's future operating results. The reserves carried for these claims as at December 31, 2001 ($2.23 billion gross; $719 million net) are believed to be adequate as these reserves are based on known facts and current law.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (continued)\\n(i) Risk Based Capital (RBC) is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. Thus, inadequately capitalized general and life insurance companies may be identified. The RBC formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. Higher factors are applied to more risky items and lower factors are applied to less risky items. Thus, the target level of statutory surplus varies not only as a result of the insurer's size, but also on the risk profile of the insurer's operations. The RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control. The statutory surplus of each of AIG's domestic general and life insurance subsidiaries exceeded their RBC standards by considerable margins as of December 31, 2001. To the extent that any of AIG's insurance entities would fall below prescribed levels of surplus, it would be AIG's intention to infuse necessary capital to support that entity.

Trading assets and trading liabilities: Fair values for trading assets and trading liabilities approximate the carrying values presented in the consolidated balance sheet. Finance receivables: the fair values of finance receivables were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based upon the weighted average rates currently being offered for similar finance receivables. Securities available for sale: Fair values for securities available for sale and related hedges were based on quoted market prices. For securities and related hedges for which market prices were not readily available, fair values were estimated using quoted market prices of comparable investments. Trading securities: Fair values for trading securities were based on current market value where available. For securities for which market values were not readily available, fair values were estimated using quoted market prices of comparable investments. Spot commodities: Fair values for spot commodities were based on current market prices. Unrealized gains and losses on interest rate and currency swaps, options and forward transactions: Fair values for swaps, options and forward transactions were based on the use of valuation models that utilize, among other things, current interest, foreign exchange and volatility rates, as applicable. Securities purchased (sold) under agreements to resell (repurchase), at contract value: As these securities (obligations) are short-term in nature, the contract values approximate fair values. Other invested assets: For assets for which market prices were not readily available, fair valuation techniques were not applied as AIG believes it would have to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived.

GIAs: Fair values of AIG\\'s obligations under investment type agreements were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based on interest rates currently being offered for similar agreements with maturities consistent with those remaining for the agreements being valued. Securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased: The carrying amounts for the financial instruments approximate fair values. Fair values for spot commodities sold short were based on current market prices. Trust deposits and deposits due to banks and other depositors: To the extent certain amounts are not demand deposits or certificates of deposit which mature in more than one year, fair values were not calculated as AIG believes it would have to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived.

One type was a stock option plan; the other, an employee stock purchase plan. AIG applied APB Opinion 25 \"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees\" and related Interpretations (APB 25) in accounting for each plan. Accordingly, no compensation costs have been recognized for the plans. Had compensation costs for these plans been determined consistent with the method of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 \"Accounting for Awards of Stock Based Compensation to Employees\" (FASB 123), AIG\\'s net income and earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts as follows:\\n(a) Post acquisition amounts. (b) Includes AGC shares which were exchanged for AIG shares at an exchange ratio of 0.5790 shares of AIG common stock for each share of AGC common stock for each year presented. (i) STOCK OPTION PLAN:On September 15, 1999, the AIG Board of Directors adopted a 1999 stock option plan (the 1999 Plan), which provides that options to purchase a maximum of 15,000,000 shares of common stock can be granted to certain key employees and members of the Board of Directors at prices not less than fair market value at the date of grant. The 1999 Plan limits the maximum number of shares as to which stock options may be granted to any employee in any one year to 375,000 shares. Options granted under this Plan expire not more than 10 years from the date of the grant. Options with respect to 25,000 shares, 12,000 shares and 13,500 shares were granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors on May 16, 2001, May 17, 2000 and September 15, 1999, respectively. These options become exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant, expire 10 years from the date of grant and do not qualify for Incentive Stock Option Treatment under the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ISO Treatment). The Plan, and the options previously granted thereunder, were approved by the shareholders at the 2000 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. At December 31, 2001, 9,383,419 shares were reserved for future grants under the 1999 Plan. The 1999 Plan superseded the 1991 employee stock option plan (the 1991 Plan) and the previously superseded 1987 employee stock option plan (the 1987 Plan), although outstanding options granted under the 1991 Plan continue in force until exercise or expiration. At December 31, 2001, there were 17,234,202 shares reserved for issuance under the 1999 and 1991 Plans. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n14. STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS (continued)\\nDuring 2001 and 2000, AIG granted options with respect to 837,275 shares and 413,500 shares, respectively, which become exercisable on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant and expire 10 years from the date of grant. These options do not qualify for ISO Treatment. The agreements with respect to all other options granted to employees under these plans provide that 25 percent of the options granted become exercisable on the anniversary of the date of grant in each of the four years following that grant and expire 10 years from the date of the grant. As of December 31, 2001, outstanding options granted with respect to 8,650,613 shares qualified for ISO Treatment. At January 1, 1999, the merger date, SunAmerica Inc. had five stock-based compensation plans pursuant to which options, restricted stock and deferred share and share unit obligations had been issued and remained outstanding. Options granted under these plans had an exercise price equal to the market price on the date of grant, had a maximum term of ten years and generally became exercisable ratably over a five-year period.

In addition, at December 31, 2001, options to purchase 403,595 shares at a weighted average exercise price of $19.81 had been previously granted to AIG non-employee directors and remained outstanding. Information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 2001, is summarized as follows:\\nThe fair values of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $213 million, $85 million and $71 million, respectively. The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions were used for grants in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively: dividend yields of 0.20 percent, 0.17 percent and 0.20 percent; expected volatilities of 28.0 percent, 27.0 percent and 25.0 percent; risk-free interest rates of 5.10 percent, 5.42 percent and 5.33 percent and expected terms of 7 years. (ii) RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS:During 2001, AIG issued performance-based restricted stock units with respect to 124,365 shares of AIG common stock in connection with contractual obligations as a result of the AGC acquisition. (iii) EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN:AIG's 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan was adopted at its 1996 shareholders' meeting and became effective as of July 1, 1996. Eligible employees may receive privileges to purchase up to an aggregate of 4,218,750 shares of AIG common stock, at a price equal to 85 percent of the fair market value on the date of the grant of the purchase privilege. Purchase privileges are granted annually and were originally limited to the number of whole shares that could be purchased by an amount equal to 5 percent of an employee's annual salary or $5,500, whichever was less. Beginning with the January 1, 1998 subscription, the maximum allowable purchase limitation increased to 10 percent of an employee's annual salary or $10,000 per year, whichever is less, and the eligibility requirement was reduced from two years to one year. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n14. STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS (continued)\\nThere were 503,847 shares, 742,773 shares and 892,929 shares issued under the 1996 plan at weighted average prices of $62.02, $52.66 and $38.24 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The excess or deficit of the proceeds over the par value or cost of the common stock issued under these plans was credited or charged to additional paid-in capital. As of December 31, 2001, there were 654,751 shares of common stock subscribed to at a weighted average price of $68.55 per share pursuant to grants of privileges under the 1996 plan. There were 336,020 shares available for the grant of future purchase privileges under the 1996 plan at December 31, 2001. The fair values of purchase privileges granted during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $14 million, $13 million and $13 million, respectively. The weighted average fair values per share of those purchase rights granted in 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $17.47, $19.36 and $14.04, respectively. The fair value of each purchase right is estimated on the date of the subscription using the Black-Scholes model. The following weighted average assumptions were used for grants in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively: dividend yields of 0.20 percent, 0.17 percent and 0.20 percent; expected volatilities of 26.0 percent, 34.0 percent and 34.0 percent; risk-free interest rates of 3.47 percent, 5.95 percent and 5.33 percent; and expected terms of 1 year. During 1999, there were 42,577 shares of AIG common stock issued under the SunAmerica Inc. employee stock purchase plan at a weighted average price of $32.60. There are no further shares available for grant under this plan. (b) The following are disclosures with respect to the stock compensation plans of AGC prior to its acquisition by AIG. Both share information and exercise price information have been recalculated to reflect the exchange ratio of 0.5790 shares of AIG common stock for each outstanding share of AGC's common stock. All of AGC's options vested immediately prior to the closing date of the acquisition. AGC's long-term incentive plans provide for the award of stock options, restricted stock awards, and performance awards to key employees and directors. Stock options constitute the majority of awards. AGC recognized no expense for stock options since the market price equaled the exercise price at the grant date. For restricted stock and performance awards, the grant date market value was amortized to expense over the vesting period. AGC adjusted the expense to reflect changes in market value of AGC's common stock and anticipated performance levels for those awards with performance criteria. AGC stock option activity was as follows:\\nOptions could not be exercised prior to six months after, nor after 10 years from, grant date. For certain stock options, one reload option was granted for each previously-owned share of common stock tendered to exercise options. Reload options vested immediately and were exercisable for the remaining term of the original options.\"),\n",

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\\n(a) Employees of AIG, its subsidiaries and certain affiliated companies, including employees in foreign countries, are generally covered under various funded and insured pension plans. Eligibility for participation in the various plans is based on either completion of a specified period of continuous service or date of hire, subject to age limitation. The HSB retirement plan was merged into the AIG retirement plan effective April 1, 2001. The AGC retirement plan was merged into the AIG retirement plan effective January 1, 2002. AIG\\'s U.S. retirement plan is a qualified, noncontributory, defined benefit plan. All qualified employees, other than those of SunAmerica and 21st Century, who have attained age 21 and completed twelve months of continuous service are eligible to participate in this plan. An employee with 5 or more years of service is entitled to pension benefits beginning at normal retirement at age 65. Benefits are based upon a percentage of average final compensation multiplied by years of credited service limited to 44 years of credited service with the exception of AGC employees where the credited service limitation is 40 years of credited service. The average final compensation is subject to certain limitations. Annual funding requirements are determined based on the \"projected unit credit\" cost method which attributes a pro rata portion of the total projected benefit payable at normal retirement to each year of credited service. AIG has adopted a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (Supplemental Plan) to provide additional retirement benefits to designated executives and key employees. Under the Supplemental Plan, the annual benefit, not to exceed 60 percent of average final compensation, accrues at a percentage of average final pay multiplied for each year of credited service reduced by any benefits from the current and any predecessor\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\n15. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (continued)\\nretirement plans, Social Security, if any, and from any qualified pension plan of prior employers. The Supplemental Plan also provides a benefit equal to the reduction in benefits payable under the AIG retirement plan as a result of Federal limitations on benefits payable thereunder. Currently, the Supplemental Plan is unfunded. AGC has adopted a Supplemental Plan which is similar to AIG\\'s. Eligibility for participation in the various non-U.S. retirement plans is either based on completion of a specified period of continuous service or date of hire, subject to age limitation. Where non-U.S. retirement plans are defined benefit plans, they are generally based on the employees\\' years of credited service and average compensation in the years preceding retirement. In addition to AIG\\'s defined benefit pension plan, AIG and its subsidiaries provide a postretirement benefit program for medical care and life insurance, domestically and in certain foreign countries. Eligibility in the various plans is generally based upon completion of a specified period of eligible service and reaching a specified age. Benefits vary by geographic location. AIG\\'s U.S. postretirement medical and life insurance benefits are based upon the employee electing immediate retirement and having a minimum of ten years of service. Retirees who were age 65 by May 1, 1989 and their dependents participate in the medical plan at no cost. Employees who retired after May 1, 1989 and on or prior to January 1, 1993 pay the active employee premium if under age 65 and 50 percent of the active employee premium if over age 65. Retiree contributions are subject to adjustment annually. Other cost sharing features of the medical plan include deductibles, coinsurance and Medicare coordination and a lifetime maximum benefit of $1.5 million. The lifetime maximum benefit of the medical plan was increased to $2.0 million effective January 1, 2000. The maximum life insurance benefit prior to age 70 is $32,500, with a maximum of $25,000 thereafter. Effective January 1, 1993, both plans\\' provisions were amended. Employees who retire after January 1, 1993 are required to pay the actual cost of the medical benefits premium reduced by a credit which is based on years of service at retirement. The life insurance benefit varies by age at retirement from $5,000 for retirement at ages 55 through 59; $10,000 for retirement at ages 60 through 64 and $15,000 for retirement at ages 65 and over. (b) AIG sponsors a voluntary savings plan for domestic employees (a 401(k) plan), which, during the three years ended December 31, 2001, provided for salary reduction contributions by employees and matching contributions by AIG of up to 6 percent of annual salary depending on the employees\\' years of service. (c) SunAmerica sponsors a voluntary savings plan for its employees (the SunAmerica 401(k) plan), which, during the three years ended December 31, 2001, provided for salary reduction contributions by qualifying employees and matching contributions by SunAmerica of up to 4 percent of qualifying employees\\' annual salaries. Under an Executive Savings Plan, designated SunAmerica executives also could defer up to 90 percent of cash compensation during the three years ended December 31, 2001, and SunAmerica matched 4 percent of the participants\\' base salaries deferred. (d) AGC sponsors a voluntary savings plan for its employees (the AGC 401(k) plan), which provides for salary reduction contributions by employees and matching contributions by AGC of up to 4.5 percent of annual salary. (e) HSB sponsors a voluntary savings plan for its employees (the HSB 401(k) plan), which provides for salary reduction contributions by employees and matching contributions by HSB of up to 6 percent of annual salary. (f) AIG has certain benefits provided to inactive employees who are not retirees.'),\n",

Participation in the SICO Plan by any person, and the amount of such participation, is at the sole discretion of SICO's Board of Directors, and none of the costs of the various benefits provided under such plan is paid by or charged to AIG.

These segments and their respective operations are as follows:\\nGeneral Insurance:AIG's general insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance. DBG writes substantially all classes of business insurance accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers. This provides DBG the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to submit business to DBG without the traditional agent-company contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no authority to commit DBG to accept a risk. HSB's operations are included in this group. Transatlantic offers reinsurance capacity both domestically and overseas on treaty and facultative bases for a full range of property and casualty products. Personal Lines engages in the mass marketing of personal lines insurance, primarily private passenger auto, homeowners and personal umbrella coverages. Mortgage Guaranty provides guaranty insurance primarily on conventional first mortgage loans on single family dwellings and condominiums. AIG's Foreign General insurance group accepts risks primarily underwritten through AIU, a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned agencies and insurance entities. The Foreign General insurance group also includes business written by AIG's foreign-based insurance subsidiaries for their own accounts. The Foreign General group uses various marketing methods to write both business and personal lines insurance\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n19.

Domestic General Insurance operations are comprised of the Domestic Brokerage Group (DBG), which includes the operations of HSB; Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (Transatlantic); Personal Lines, including 21st Century Insurance Group (21st Century); and United Guaranty Corporation (UGC). AIG’s primary domestic division is DBG. DBG’s business is derived from brokers in the United States and Canada and is conducted through its General Insurance subsidiaries including American Home, National Union, Lexington and certain other General Insurance company subsidiaries of AIG. The AIG Risk Management operation provides insurance and risk management programs for large corporate customers. The AIG Risk Finance division designs and implements risk financing alternatives using the insurance and financial services capabilities of AIG. Also included in DBG are the operations of AIG Environmental, which focuses specifically on providing specialty products to clients with environmental exposures. DBG writes substantially all classes of business insurance accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers. This provides DBG the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to submit business to DBG without the traditional agent-company contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no authority to commit DBG to accept a risk. In addition to writing substantially all classes of business insurance, including large commercial or industrial property insurance, excess liability, inland marine, environmental, workers’ compensation and excess and umbrella coverages, DBG offers many specialized forms of insurance such as equipment breakdown, directors and officers liability, difference-in-conditions, kidnap-ransom, export credit and political risk, and various types of professional errors and omissions coverages. Lexington writes surplus lines, those risks for which conventional insurance companies do not readily provide insurance coverage, either because of complexity or because the coverage does not lend itself to conventional contracts. Transatlantic offers reinsurance capacity on both treaty and facultative basis. Transatlantic structures programs for a full range of property and casualty products with an emphasis on specialty risk. AIG engages in mass marketing of personal lines coverages, primarily private passenger auto and personal umbrella coverages, principally through American International Insur-\\nFORM 10-K : 3\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nance Company and 21st Century. In 2003, AIG acquired the U.S.-based auto and home insurance business of General Electric Company (GE). The business of UGC and its subsidiaries is also included in the domestic operations of AIG. The principal business of the UGC subsidiaries is the writing of residential mortgage loan insurance, which is guaranty insurance on conventional first mortgage loans on single-family dwellings and condominiums. Such insurance protects lenders against loss if borrowers default. UGC subsidiaries also write home equity and property improvement loan insurance on loans to finance residential property improvements, alterations and repairs and for other purposes not necessarily related to real estate. During 2003, UGC commenced providing guaranty insurance to providers of student loans. UGC had approximately $22 billion of guaranty risk in-force at December 31, 2003. AIG’s Foreign General insurance group accepts risks primarily underwritten through American International Underwriters (AIU), a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned agencies and insurance companies. The Foreign General insurance group also includes business written by AIG’s foreign-based insurance subsidiaries for their own accounts. The Foreign General group uses various marketing methods to write both business and personal lines insurance with certain refinements for local laws, customs and needs. AIU operates in Asia, the Pacific Rim, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America. During 2003, DBG and the Foreign General insurance group accounted for 57.0 percent and 21.5 percent, respectively, of AIG’s General Insurance net premiums written. AIG’s General Insurance company subsidiaries worldwide operate primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account and securing reinsurance on that portion of the risk in excess of the limit which they wish to retain. This operating policy differs from that of many insurance companies which will underwrite only up to their net retention limit, thereby requiring the broker or agent to secure commitments from other underwriters for the remainder of the gross risk amount. The utilization of reinsurance is closely monitored by an internal reinsurance security committee, consisting of members of AIG’s senior management. No single reinsurer is a material reinsurer to AIG nor is AIG’s business substantially dependent upon any reinsurance contract. (See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG is diversified both in terms of lines of business and geographic locations. Of the General Insurance lines of business, workers’ compensation was approximately 12 percent of AIG’s net premiums written. This line of business is also diversified geographically. The majority of AIG’s General Insurance business is in the casualty classes, which tend to involve longer periods of time for the reporting and settling of claims. This may increase the risk and uncertainty with respect to AIG’s loss reserve development. (See also the Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nLoss and expense ratios of AIG’s consolidated General Insurance operations are set forth in the following table. (See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\n(a)\\nExcluding the net loss reserve charge of $2.8 billion, the General Insurance combined ratio would have been 94.4.

(c)\\nSource: Best’s Aggregates & Averages (Stock insurance companies, after dividends to policyholders): the ratio for 2003 was obtained from Fox-Pitt, Kelton Inc. and reflects estimated results. During 2003, of the direct General Insurance premiums written (gross premiums less return premiums and cancellations, excluding reinsurance assumed and before deducting reinsurance ceded), 11.0 percent, 7.6 percent and 6.4 percent were written in California, Illinois and New York, respectively. No other state accounted for more than 5 percent of such premiums. There was no significant adverse effect on AIG’s General Insurance results of operations from the economic environments in any one state, country or geographic region for the year ended December 31, 2003. (See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nFORM 10-K : 4\\nDiscussion and Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development\\nThe reserve for net losses and loss expenses represents the accumulation of estimates for reported losses (“case basis reserves”) and provisions for losses incurred but not reported (IBNR), both reduced by applicable reinsurance recoverable. Losses and loss expenses are charged to income as incurred. Loss reserves established with respect to foreign business are set and monitored in terms of the respective local or functional currency. Therefore, no assumption is included for changes in currency rates. (See also Note 1(w) of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nManagement reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves through the utilization of a number of analytical reserve development techniques. Through the use of these techniques, management is able to monitor the adequacy of its established reserves and determine appropriate assumptions for inflation. Also, analysis of emerging specific development patterns, such as case reserve redundancies or deficiencies and IBNR emergence, allows management to determine any required adjustments. (See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nThe “Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development Excluding Asbestos and Environmental Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development” table, which follows, presents the development of net losses and loss expense reserves for calendar years 1993 through 2003. The upper half of the table shows the cumulative amounts paid during successive years related to the opening loss reserves. For example, with respect to the net losses and loss expense reserve of $19.66 billion as of December 31, 1996, by the end of 2003 (seven years later) $16.30 billion had actually been paid in settlement of these net loss reserves. In addition, as reflected in the lower section of the table, the original reserve of $19.66 billion was reestimated to be $19.11 billion at December 31, 2003. This decrease from the original estimate would generally be a combination of a number of factors, including reserves being settled for smaller amounts than originally estimated.'),\n",

The redundancy (deficiency) depicted in the table, for any particular calendar year, shows the aggregate change in estimates over the period of years subsequent to the calendar year reflected at the top of the respective column heading. For example, the deficiency of $1.54 billion at December 31, 2003 related to December 31, 2002 net losses and loss expense reserves of $29.65 billion represents the cumulative amount by which reserves for 2002 and prior years have developed deficiently during 2003. The deficiency that has emerged in the last year can be attributed primarily to claims from accident years 1999 and 2000. The accident year emergence can be seen by comparing the respective developments in 2003 for each column’s loss reserve in the table below. For example, the liability associated with the year end 2000 loss reserves increased to $30.12 billion at year end 2003 from $28.26 billion at year end 2002, an increase of $1.86 billion in 2003. Thus, loss estimates for accident years 2000 and prior, which comprise the year end 2000 loss reserve, increased by $1.86 billion during 2003. Similarly, the table shows that the loss estimates for accident years 1999 and prior, which comprise the year end 1999 loss reserve, increased to $28.10 billion at year end 2003 from $26.95 billion at year end 2002, an increase of approximately $1.15 billion. This increase of $1.15 billion, as compared to the $1.86 billion increase in the 2000 column, indicates that accident year 2000 loss estimates increased by approximately $710 million during 2003, i.e. the difference between the respective $1.86 billion and $1.15 billion amounts. Similar calculations from the table below reveal that the accident year 1999 loss estimates increased approximately $600 million during 2003. Thus, loss estimates for accident years 1999 and 2000 increased by approximately $1.3 billion during 2003. Loss estimates also increased for accident years 1998 and prior, but by amounts small in comparison to 1999 and 2000. The primary cause of these higher loss estimates is higher than expected loss emergence in 2003. Loss development patterns utilized to test the reserves generally rely on the actual historical loss development patterns of prior accident years for each class of business. Accident years 1999 and 2000 exhibited significantly higher than normal loss development in the latest calendar year, thus creating the adverse developments noted above. The classes accounting for the majority of this higher than expected loss emergence in 2003 were excess casualty, directors and officers’ liability, and healthcare liability. It should be noted that loss estimates for accident years 2001 and 2002 did not develop adversely in 2003. Additionally, as shown in the table below, loss emergence from year end 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996 has been favorable on an inception to date basis through year end 2003. The reserve for net losses and loss expenses with respect to Transatlantic and 21st Century are included only in the consolidated net losses and loss expenses commencing with the year ended December 31, 1998. Reserve development for these operations is included only for the 1998 and subsequent periods.'),\n",

Life Insurance Operations\\nAIG’s Life Insurance subsidiaries offer a wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment products both domestically and abroad. Traditional products consist of individual and group life, annuity, endowment and accident and health policies. Financial and investment products consist of fixed and variable annuities, guaranteed investment contracts and pensions. (See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nLife Insurance operations in foreign countries comprised 78.0 percent of GAAP Life premiums and 59.7 percent of life operating income in 2003. AIG operates overseas principally through ALICO, AIA and Nan Shan. ALICO is incorporated in Delaware and all of its business is written outside of the United States. ALICO has operations either directly or through subsidiaries in Europe, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, South Asia and the Far East, with Japan being the largest territory. AIG added significantly to its presence in Japan with the acquisition of GE Edison Life Insurance Company, (now known as AIG Edison Life Insurance Company) (AIG Edison Life), in 2003 and AIG Star Life in 2001, as a result of the reorganization of Chiyoda Mutual Life Insurance Company. AIA operates primarily in China (including Hong Kong), Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. Nan Shan operates in Taiwan. (See also Note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nFORM 10-K : 8\\nAIG’s principal domestic Life Insurance operations include AIG American General Life, AIG Annuity and SunAmerica Life. These companies utilize multiple distribution channels including brokerage and career and general agents to offer traditional life products as well as financial and investment products. The domestic life operations comprised 22.0 percent of total GAAP Life premiums in 2003. There was no significant adverse effect on AIG’s Life Insurance results of operations from economic environments in any one state, country or geographic region for the year ended December 31, 2003. (See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nTraditional Life Insurance products such as whole life and endowment continue to be significant in the overseas companies, especially in Southeast Asia, while a mixture of traditional, accident and health and financial products are sold in Japan. In addition to the above, AIG also has subsidiary operations in the Philippines, Canada, Mexico, Poland, Switzerland and Puerto Rico, and conducts life insurance business through AIUO subsidiary companies in Russia, Israel and in certain countries in Central and South America. The foreign life companies have over 230,000 career agents and sell their products largely to indigenous persons in local currencies. In addition to the agency outlets, these companies also distribute their products through direct marketing channels, such as mass marketing, and through brokers and other distribution outlets such as financial institutions. Insurance Investment Operations\\nA significant portion of AIG’s general and life operating revenues are derived from AIG’s insurance investment operations.

FORM 10-K : 9\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nAIG’s worldwide insurance investment policy places primary emphasis on investments in high quality, fixed income securities in all of its portfolios and, to a lesser extent, investments in marketable common stocks, in order to preserve policyholders’ surplus and generate net investment income. The ability to implement this policy is somewhat limited in certain territories as there may be a lack of qualified long term investments or investment restrictions may be imposed by the local regulatory authorities. (See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nFinancial Services Operations\\nAIG’s Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified financial products and services including aircraft leasing, capital market transactions, and consumer and insurance premium financing. AIG’s Aircraft Finance Operations represent the operations of ILFC which engages primarily in the acquisition of commercial jet aircraft and the leasing and remarketing of such aircraft to airlines around the world. Also, ILFC provides, for a fee, fleet management services to certain third-party operators. (See also Note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nDuring the third quarter, AIG integrated the operations of AIG Trading Group Inc. (AIGTG) into AIGFP thereby establishing the Capital Markets reporting unit. AIGFP engages as principal in standard and customized interest rate, currency, equity, and credit products with top tier corporations, financial institutions, governments, agencies, institutional investors, and high net worth individuals throughout the world. AIGFP also raises funds through municipal re-investment contracts and other private and public security offerings, investing the proceeds in a diversified portfolio of high grade securities and derivative transactions.

(See also Note 1(q) of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nLocations of Certain Assets\\nAs of December 31, 2003, approximately 30 percent of the consolidated assets of AIG were located in foreign countries (other than Canada), including $3.05 billion of cash and securities on deposit with foreign regulatory authorities. Foreign operations and assets held abroad may be adversely affected by political developments in foreign countries, including such possibilities as tax changes, nationalization and changes in regulatory policy, as well as by consequence of hostilities and unrest. The risks of such occurrences and their overall effect upon AIG vary from country to country and cannot easily be predicted. If expropriation or nationalization does occur, AIG’s policy is to take all appropriate measures to seek recovery of such assets. Certain of the countries in which AIG’s business is conducted have currency restrictions which generally cause a delay in a company’s ability to repatriate assets and profits. (See also Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nRegulation and Competition\\nCertain states require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies that are licensed in such states and are controlled by other corporations. Applicable legislation typically requires periodic disclosure concerning the corporation that controls the registered insurer and the other companies in the holding company system and prior approval of intercorporate transfers of assets (including in some instances payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiary) within the holding company system. AIG’s subsidiaries are registered under such legislation in those states that have such requirements. (See also Note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG’s insurance subsidiaries, in common with other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and by other jurisdictions in which they do business. Within the United States, the method of such regulation varies but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory and supervisory powers to an insurance official. The regulation and supervision relate primarily to approval of policy forms and rates, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, including risk-based capital measurements, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on investments, restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, methods of accounting, periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies, the form and content of reports of financial condition required to be filed, and reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than security holders. (See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)\\nRisk-Based Capital (RBC) is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. Thus, inadequately capitalized General and Life Insurance companies may be identified. The RBC formula develops a risk adjusted target level of statutory surplus by applying certain factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. Higher factors are applied to more risky items and lower factors are applied to less risky items. Thus, the target level of statutory surplus varies not only as a result of the insurer’s size, but also on the risk profile of the insurer’s operations. The RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control. The risk-based adjusted surplus of each of AIG’s Domestic General and Life Insurance subsidiaries exceeded their RBC standards as of December 31, 2003. To the extent that any of AIG’s insurance entities would fall below prescribed levels of surplus, it would be AIG’s intention to infuse necessary capital to support that entity. Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act became fully effective in 2001. These provisions established consumer protections regarding the security and confidentiality of nonpublic personal information and require full disclosure of the privacy policies of financial institutions to their consumer customers.'),\n",

These statutes and similar legislation and regulations in the United States or other jurisdictions could impact AIG’s ability to market its products or otherwise limit the nature or scope of AIG’s Insurance and Financial Services operations. FORM 10-K : 11\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nA substantial portion of AIG’s General Insurance business and a majority of its Life Insurance business is carried on in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies from minimal in some to stringent in others. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification or revocation by such authorities, and AIU or other AIG subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. In the past, AIU has been allowed to modify its operations to conform with new licensing requirements in most jurisdictions. In addition to licensing requirements, AIG’s foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, policy language and terms, amount and type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of local investment and the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on participating policies. Some foreign countries regulate rates on various types of policies. Certain countries have established reinsurance institutions, wholly or partially owned by the state, to which admitted insurers are obligated to cede a portion of their business on terms which do not always allow foreign insurers, including AIG, full compensation. In some countries, regulations governing constitution of technical reserves and remittance balances may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets. The insurance industry is highly competitive. Within the United States, AIG’s General Insurance subsidiaries compete with approximately 3,000 other stock companies, specialty insurance organizations, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations. AIG’s subsidiaries offering Life Insurance and Retirement Services compete in the United States with approximately 1,800 life insurance companies and other participants in related financial service fields. Overseas, AIG subsidiaries compete for business with foreign insurance operations of the larger U.S. insurers and local companies in particular areas in which they are active. AIG’s Insurance, Financial Services and Asset Management operations operate in a highly competitive and increasingly regulated environment, both domestically and overseas. Principal sources of competition are banks, investment banks and other non-bank financial institutions. The focus of AIG’s operations has also become more consumer-oriented, thereby increasing the risks of regulatory supervision and intervention. ITEM 2.'),\n",

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful. Gross premiums written, statutory underwriting profit (loss) and combined ratios are presented in accordance with accounting principles prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities because these are standard measures of performance used in the insurance industry and thus allow more meaningful comparisons with AIG’s insurance competitors. AIG has also incorporated into this discussion a number of parenthetical cross-references to additional information included throughout this Form 10-K to assist readers seeking related information on a particular subject. Introduction and Executive Summary\\nAIG’s operations in 2003 were conducted by its subsidiaries principally through four operating segments: General Insurance, Life Insurance, Financial Services and Retirement Services & Asset Management. Through these segments, AIG provided insurance and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in over 130 countries and jurisdictions. This geographic product and service diversification is one of AIG’s major strengths and sets it apart from its competitors. Although regional economic downturns or political upheaval could negatively impact parts of AIG’s operations, AIG believes that this diversification makes it unlikely that regional difficulties would have a material impact on its operating results, financial condition or liquidity. AIG’s subsidiaries serve commercial, institutional and individual customers through an extensive property-casualty and life insurance network. In the United States, AIG companies are the largest underwriter of commercial and industrial insurance and one of the largest life insurance operations as well. AIG’s Financial Services businesses include commercial aircraft leasing, capital markets and consumer finance, both in the United States and abroad. AIG also has one of the largest retirement services business in the United States and provides asset management services to institutions and individuals. AIG’s 2003 performance reflects implementation of various long-term strategies and defined goals in its various operating segments. A primary goal of AIG in managing its General Insurance operations is to achieve an underwriting profit - maintaining a combined loss and expense ratio under 100. To achieve this end, AIG is disciplined in its risk selection and premiums must be adequate to cover the risk accepted. AIG believes in strict control of expenses, so it historically has one of the lowest expense ratios in the industry. AIG patiently builds relationships in markets around the world where it sees long-term growth opportunities. For example, AIG’s ability to expand its Chinese operations more quickly and extensively than its competitors is the result of relationships developed over nearly 30 years. AIG’s more recent extensions of operations into India, Brazil, Russia and other emerging markets follow the same pattern. Moreover, AIG believes in investing in the economies and infrastructures of these countries and growing with them. When AIG companies enter a new jurisdiction, they typically offer both basic protection and savings products. As the economies evolve, AIG’s products evolve with them, to more complex and investment-oriented models. Another central focus of AIG operations in current years is the development and expansion of new distribution channels. In late 2003, AIG entered into an agreement with the Peoples Insurance Company of China (PICC) which will enable AIG companies to market accident and health products throughout China through PICC’s agency system. Other examples of new distribution channels used both domestically and overseas include banks, affinity groups and e-commerce. Growth for AIG may be generated both internally and through acquisitions which both fulfill strategic goals and offer adequate return on investment. In recent years, the acquisitions of AIG Star Life and AIG Edison Life have broadened AIG’s penetration of the Japanese market, the second largest for life insurance in the world. These acquisitions broadened AIG’s distribution channels and will result in operating efficiencies as they are integrated into AIG’s previously existing companies operating in Japan. AIG provides leadership on issues of concern to the global and local economies as well as the insurance and financial services industries. In recent years, tort reform and legislation to deal with the asbestos problem have been key issues, while in prior years trade legislation and superfund have been issues of concern. The following table summarizes AIG’s revenues, income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes and net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001:\\nFORM 10-K : 17\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nConsolidated Results\\nThe 20.5 percent growth in revenues in 2003 was primarily attributable to the growth in net premiums earned from global General Insurance operations as well as growth in both General Insurance and Life Insurance net investment income and GAAP Life premiums. Additionally, net realized capital losses declined $1.0 billion in 2003 over 2002. AIG’s income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of an accounting change increased 70.8 percent in 2003 when compared to 2002. General Insurance and Life Insurance operating income gains, together with the reduction of realized capital losses as well as the impact of the loss reserve charge in 2002, were the primary factors for the increase over 2002 in both pretax income and net income. The following table summarizes the operations of each principal segment for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

(f)\\nRepresents other income (deductions)-net, and for 2001, acquisition, restructuring and related charges connected to the acquisition of American General Corporation. General Insurance\\nAIG’s General Insurance operations provide property and casualty products and services throughout the world. The increase in General Insurance operating income in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily attributable to strong growth in operating income with respect to Domestic Brokerage Group’s and Foreign General’s operations in 2003 and the impact of the loss reserve charge of $2.8 billion in 2002. In addition, the level of realized capital losses with respect to General Insurance operations declined to $172 million in 2003 from $858 million in 2002. General Insurance operating income in 2002 was substantially lower than 2001 due to the $2.8 billion reserve charge in 2002. Life Insurance\\nAIG’s Life Insurance operations provide traditional, financial and investment products throughout the world. AIG’s foreign operations provide over 50 percent of AIG’s Life Insurance operating income. Life Insurance operating income increased by 21.8 percent in 2003. This increase resulted from growth in each of AIG’s principal life insurance businesses, and the decline in realized capital losses to $826 million in 2003 from $1.05 billion in 2002. Life Insurance operating income grew in 2002 relative to 2001. This growth rate was negatively impacted by substantial increase in realized capital losses in 2002, compared to the $254 million realized capital losses in 2001. Financial Services\\nAIG’s Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified financial products and services including aircraft leasing, capital market transactions and consumer and insurance premium financing. Financial Services operating income increased in 2003 compared to 2002 and in 2002 compared to 2001, reflecting operating income growth derived from a broadened range of businesses and products in each year. Retirement Services & Asset Management\\nAIG’s Retirement Services & Asset Management operations provide a wide variety of investment products, including variable annuities and mutual funds, as well as investment services, such as asset management. These products and services are offered to individuals, government agencies and institutions both domestically and overseas. Retirement Services & Asset Management operating income increased 25.1 percent in 2003 when compared to 2002 as a result of the upturn in worldwide financial markets and the improved U.S. economic conditions; operating income declined 6.6 percent in 2002 when compared to 2001 due to the depressed markets and economic environment. FORM 10-K : 18\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nRealized Capital Losses\\nAIG incurred net realized capital losses of $1.43 billion in 2003, $2.44 billion in 2002 and $836 million in 2001. The realized capital losses in each year reflect primarily impairment loss provisions. Upon the ultimate disposition of these holdings, a portion of these losses may be recovered depending on future market conditions. Capital Resources\\nAt December 31, 2003, AIG had total shareholders’ equity of $71.25 billion and total borrowings of $77.28 billion. At that date, $69.63 billion of such borrowings were either not guaranteed by AIG or were matched borrowings under obligations of guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs) or matched notes and bonds payable. During 2003, AIG repurchased in the open market 3,822,500 shares of its common stock. Liquidity\\nAt December 31, 2003, consolidated invested assets were $525.23 billion including $9.84 billion in cash and short-term investments. Consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in 2003 amounted to $36.16 billion. AIG believes that its liquid assets, cash provided by operations and access to the capital markets will enable it to meet any forseeable cash requirements. Outlook\\nOverall, premium rates in the General Insurance business have continued to be strong both domestically and in key international markets, although the rates of increase have moderated in most lines and begun to fall in certain classes. AIG also continues to be able to modify and limit its contractual obligations by adding appropriate exclusions and policy restrictions. AIG expects total premiums to increase for 2004 resulting in positive growth in cash flow for investments. Thus, General Insurance net investment income is expected to rise in future quarters even in the current low interest rate environment. In October 2003, AIG entered into an agreement with PICC that will enable AIG to market its accident and health products through PICC’s 4,300 branch offices throughout the country. PICC has over 70 percent of the non-life market in China and AIG expects substantial opportunity for growth through this new distribution channel. In the Life Insurance segment, AIG expects overall continued growth through expansion in China, where AIG was the first foreign insurance organization to have wholly owned Life Insurance operations in eight major cities, as well as in India, Korea and Vietnam. AIG Edison Life was acquired in August of 2003. AIG Edison Life adds to the current agency force in Japan, and provides alternative distribution channels including banks, financial advisers, and corporate and government employee relationships. AIG Edison Life’s integration into AIG’s existing Japanese operations will provide future operating efficiencies. Domestically, AIG expects continued strong operating growth in 2004 as distribution channels are expanded and new products are introduced. In the airline industry, changes in market conditions are not immediately apparent in operating results. Therefore, AIG believes that improvements in that market commencing in 2003 will be gradually reflected in ILFC’s results in 2004. In the Capital Markets operations, the integration of AIG Trading Group Inc. (AIGTG) into the AIGFP operations created operating efficiencies that will continue to be realized and product synergies that should enhance 2004 results. AIG also expects increased contributions to Financial Services revenues and income from its consumer finance operations both domestically, as a result of the improving economy, and overseas, as expansion of credit card operations continues and economic conditions improve. AIG expects both its Retirement Services operations and its Asset Management operations to continue to benefit from the recovery in the equity markets and global economy. AIG has many promising growth initiatives underway around the world in its insurance and other operations. Cooperative agreements such as those in Russia and with the PICC are expected to expand distribution networks for AIG’s products and investment opportunities and provide models for future growth. Critical Accounting Estimates\\nAIG considers its most critical accounting estimates those with respect to reserves for losses and loss expenses, future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts, deferred policy acquisition costs, and fair value determinations for certain Capital Markets assets and liabilities. These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, AIG’s results of operations would be directly impacted. FORM 10-K : 19\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nThroughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, AIG’s critical accounting estimates are discussed in detail. The major categories for which assumptions are developed and used to establish each critical accounting estimate are highlighted below. Reserves for Losses and Loss Expenses (General Insurance):\\n•\\nLoss trend factors: used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on the projected loss ratio with respect to prior accident years. •\\nExpected loss ratios for the latest accident year: in this case, accident year 2003 for the year end 2003 loss reserve analysis. For low frequency, high severity classes such as Excess Casualty and Directors and Officers’ Liability, expected loss ratios generally are utilized for at least the three most recent accident years. •\\nLoss development factors: used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate amount. Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health Contracts (Life Insurance):\\n•\\nInterest rates: which vary by territory, year of issuance and products. •\\nMortality, morbidity and surrender rates: based upon actual experience by geographical region modified to allow for variation in policy form. Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs (General Insurance):\\n•\\nRecoverability based upon the current profitability of the underlying insurance contracts. Life Insurance and Retirement Services & Asset Management:\\n•\\nEstimated gross profits: to be realized over the estimated duration of the contracts (nontraditional life).'),\n",

When such prices are not available, AIG uses an internal methodology, which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices from trades occurring on dates nearest to the dates of the transactions. Operating Review\\nGeneral Insurance Operations\\nAIG’s General Insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance both domestically and abroad. Domestic General Insurance operations are comprised of DBG, which includes HSB; Transatlantic; Personal Lines, including 21st Century; and UGC (Mortgage Guaranty). DBG is AIG’s primary domestic general division. DBG writes substantially all classes of business insurance accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers. This provides DBG the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to submit business to DBG without the traditional agent-company contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no authority to commit DBG to accept a risk. Transatlantic offers, through its reinsurance company subsidiaries, reinsurance capacity, both domestically and overseas, on a treaty and facultative basis for a full range of property and casualty products. Personal Lines engages in the mass marketing of personal lines insurance, primarily private passenger auto and personal umbrella coverages, as well as providing comprehensive insurance coverage to high net-worth households through its Private Client Group. UGC provides guaranty insurance to mortgage providers primarily with respect to conventional first mortgage loans on single family dwellings and condominiums. During 2003, UGC commenced providing guaranty insurance to providers of student loans. AIG’s Foreign General insurance group accepts risks primarily underwritten through AIU, a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned agencies and insurance entities. The Foreign General insurance group also includes business written by AIG’s foreign-based insurance subsidiaries for their own accounts. (See also Note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAs previously noted, AIG believes it should present and discuss its financial information in a manner most meaningful to its investors. Accordingly, in its General Insurance business, AIG uses certain non-GAAP measures, where AIG has determined these measurements to be useful and meaningful. A critical discipline of a successful general insurance business is the objective to produce operating income from underwriting exclusive of investment related income. When underwriting is not profitable, premiums are inadequate to pay for insured losses and underwriting related expenses. In these situations, the addition of general insurance related in-\\nFORM 10-K : 20\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nvestment income and realized capital gains may, however, enable a general insurance business to produce operating income. If underwriting losses persist over extended periods, an insurance company will likely not continue to exist as a going concern. For these reasons, AIG views underwriting profit to be critical in the overall evaluation of performance. Although in and of itself not a GAAP measurement, AIG believes this measurement is a useful and meaningful disclosure. (See also the discussion under “Liquidity” herein.)\\nGeneral Insurance operating income is comprised of underwriting profit (loss), net investment income and realized capital gains and losses.

The net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period. Thus, the net unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized as net premiums earned until the end of the policy period. Commencing in the latter part of 1999 and continuing through 2003, the commercial property-casualty market place has experienced premium rate increases. Virtually all areas of DBG have experienced premium rate increases as well as maintaining an excellent retention rate for desired renewal business. The vast majority of the net premiums written increase in 2003 resulted from rate increases with respect to renewed business. Overall, DBG’s net premiums written increased in 2003 and 2002. Adjusting this growth for cancelled or nonrenewed business, such growth would have approximated 38 percent in 2003 and 56 percent in 2002. AIG believes that these premium rate increases will continue into 2004 particularly with respect to long tail lines of business where the insurer’s stability is critical to the insured. Based on historical patterns, AIG believes that overall growth in net premiums written will slow as competition for premiums increases in certain lines of business.

Mortgage Guaranty’s net premiums written increased 4.7 percent in 2003 over 2002 primarily due to its entry into student loan insurance market beginning in early 2003. The residential first mortgage operation was negatively impacted by refinancing fueled by low interest rates. AIG anticipates continued growth in Mortgage Guaranty in 2004 resulting from a full year of student loan insurance operations. Also, as the number of refinancings decreases, persistency should improve on the first mortgage book and renewal premiums are expected to increase. Underwriting profit should recover from the decrease shown in 2003 which resulted from the adverse impact on net premiums earned from the refinancing activities. Foreign General insurance net premiums written growth was due to premium rate increases as well as flight to quality. The regions that had the strongest premium growth were Western Europe and UK/Ireland. Although AIG expects growth in Foreign General commercial lines rates to decelerate in 2004, Foreign General has commenced various initiatives with respect to target markets, products, and distribution to offset this decline. In comparing the foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the results of AIG’s Foreign General operations during 2003 to those foreign currency exchange rates used to translate AIG’s Foreign General results during 2002, the U.S. dollar weakened slightly in value in relation to most major foreign currencies in which AIG transacts business. Accordingly, when foreign net premiums written were translated into U.S. dollars for the purposes of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, total General Insurance net premiums written were approximately 1.9 percentage points more than they would have been if translated utilizing those foreign currency exchange rates which prevailed during 2002. AIG, along with most General Insurance entities, uses the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of performance. The loss ratio is the sum of losses and loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned.'),\n",

The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. These ratios are relative measurements that describe for every $100 of net premiums earned or written, the cost of losses and statutory expenses, respectively. The combined ratio presents the total cost per $100 of premium production. A combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit; a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting loss. The 2003 domestic and foreign combined ratios improved over last year’s ratios primarily because the growth in net premiums exceeded the growth in expenses, continued expense control in 2003 and the impact of the $2.8 billion loss reserve charge in 2002. Underwriting profit is measured in two ways: statutory underwriting profit and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) underwriting profit. Statutory underwriting profit is arrived at by reducing net premiums earned by net losses and loss expenses incurred and net expenses incurred. Statutory accounting generally requires immediate expense recognition and ignores the matching of revenues and expenses as required by GAAP. That is, for statutory purposes, expenses are recognized immediately, not over the same period that the revenues are earned. A basic premise of GAAP accounting is the recognition of expenses at the same time revenues are earned, the accounting principle of matching. Therefore, to convert underwriting results to a GAAP basis, acquisition expenses are deferred (deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC)) and amortized over the period the related net premiums written are earned. Accordingly, the statutory underwriting profit has been adjusted as a result of acquisition expenses being deferred as required by GAAP. DAC is reviewed for recoverability and such review requires management judgment.

With respect to catastrophe losses, AIG believes that it has taken appropriate steps, such as careful exposure selection and obtaining reinsurance coverage, to reduce the impact of the magnitude of possible future losses. The occurrence of one or more catastrophic events of unanticipated frequency or severity, such as a terrorist attack, earthquake or hurricane, that causes insured losses, however, could have a material adverse effect on AIG’s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. General Insurance net investment income grew in 2003 when compared to 2002. The invested cash flow resulting from the growth in net premiums written in this and prior periods had a positive impact on net investment income. In 2002, net investment income decreased when compared to 2001. The decrease in net investment income in 2002 was primarily a result of lower earnings with respect to the general insurance private equity portfolio. Also, interest income earned from the General Insurance bond portfolio was impacted by lower yields as the proceeds from maturing fixed income securities were reinvested. As AIG believes that net premiums written will continue to increase in 2004, it is expected that cash flow for investment will continue to grow as well. As a result, net investment income is expected to grow in 2004. (See also the discussion under “Liquidity” herein and Note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nRealized gains and losses resulted from the ongoing investment management of the General Insurance portfolios within the overall objectives of the General Insurance operations and were reflective of weakness in the equity markets in early 2003 and prior periods and impairment loss provisions for both equity and fixed income holdings in all three years. (See the discussion on “Valuation of Invested Assets” herein.)\\nThe increase in General Insurance operating income in 2003 was primarily attributable to strong profitable growth in DBG’s and Foreign General’s operations, the decrease in realized capital losses relative to prior periods and the impact of the loss reserve charge in 2002. The decline in the growth rate in 2002 was caused by the $2.8 billion loss reserve charge as well as the $728 million increase in realized capital losses in 2002. The contribution of General Insurance operating income to AIG’s consolidated income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes was 36.5 percent in 2003 compared to 8.2 percent in 2002 and 35.0 percent in 2001. The increase over 2002 and the decrease of 2002 compared to 2001 was a result of the $2.8 billion loss reserve charge in 2002. Reinsurance\\nAIG is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its General Insurance operations. AIG is cognizant of the need to exercise good judgment in the selection and approval of both domestic and foreign companies participating in its reinsurance programs. AIG insures risks globally and its reinsurance programs must be coordinated in order to provide AIG the level of reinsurance protection that AIG desires. AIG purchases reinsurance to mitigate its catastrophic exposure. However, one or more catastrophe losses could negatively impact AIG’s reinsurers and result in an inability of AIG to collect reinsurance recoverables. AIG’s reinsurance department evaluates catastrophic events and assesses the probability of occurrence and magnitude of catastrophic events through the use of state of the art industry recognized program models among other techniques. AIG supplements these models through continually monitoring the risk exposure of AIG’s worldwide general insurance operations and adjusting such models accordingly. While reinsurance arrangements do not relieve AIG from its direct obligations to its insureds, an efficient and effective reinsurance program substantially limits AIG’s probable losses. FORM 10-K : 23\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nAIG’s general reinsurance assets amounted to $26.76 billion and resulted from AIG’s reinsurance arrangements. Thus, a credit exposure existed at December 31, 2003 with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer may not be able to reimburse AIG under the terms of these reinsurance arrangements. AIG manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound, and when necessary AIG holds substantial collateral in the form of funds, securities and/or irrevocable letters of credit. This collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods on an individual reinsurer basis. At December 31, 2003, approximately 47 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from unauthorized reinsurers. In order to obtain statutory recognition, the majority of these balances were collateralized. The remaining 53 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from authorized reinsurers. The terms authorized and unauthorized pertain to regulatory categories, not creditworthiness. Approximately 90 percent of the balances with respect to authorized reinsurers are from reinsurers rated A (excellent) or better, as rated by A.M.

At that date, AIG had no significant reinsurance recoverables from any individual reinsurer which is financially troubled (e.g., liquidated, insolvent, in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction). AIG’s Reinsurance Security Department conducts ongoing detailed assessments of the reinsurance markets and current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic. Such assessments include, but are not limited to, identifying if a reinsurer is appropriately licensed, and has sufficient financial capacity, and the local economic environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates. This department also reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for collateral. For example, in AIG’s treaty reinsurance contracts, AIG includes credit triggers that require a reinsurer to post collateral when a referenced event occurs. Such credit triggers include, but are not limited to, insurer financial strength rating downgrades, policyholder surplus declines at or below a certain predetermined level or a certain predetermined level of a reinsurance recoverable being reached. In addition, AIG’s Credit Risk Committee reviews the credit limits for and concentrations with any one reinsurer.

Any adjustments resulting\\nFORM 10-K : 24\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\ntherefrom are reflected in operating income currently. It is management’s belief that the General Insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover all General Insurance net losses and loss expenses as at December 31, 2003. While AIG annually reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that AIG’s ultimate loss reserves will not adversely develop and materially exceed AIG’s loss reserves as of December 31, 2003. In the future, if the general insurance net loss reserves develop deficiently, such deficiency would have an adverse impact on future results of operations. See “2002 Loss Reserve Charge” herein. In a very broad sense, the General Insurance loss reserves can be categorized into two distinct groups, one group being long tail casualty lines of business. Such lines include excess and umbrella liability, directors and officers’ liability, professional liability, medical malpractice, general liability, products’ liability, and related classes. The other group is short tail lines of business consisting principally of property lines, personal lines and certain classes of casualty lines. For operations writing short tail coverages, such as property coverages, the process of recording quarterly loss reserve changes is geared toward maintaining an appropriate reserve level for the outstanding exposure, rather than determining an expected loss ratio for current business. For example, the IBNR reserve required for a class of property business might be expected to approximate 20 percent of the latest year’s earned premiums, and this level of reserve would be maintained regardless of the loss ratio emerging in the current quarter. The 20 percent factor is adjusted to reflect changes in rate levels, loss reporting patterns, known exposures to large unreported losses, or other factors affecting the particular class of business. Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses (net losses) for long tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the line and volume of the business involved. Experience in the more recent accident years of long tail casualty lines shows limited statistical credibility in reported net losses. That is, a relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims and expenses and an even smaller proportion would be net losses paid. A relatively high proportion of net losses would therefore be IBNR. AIG’s carried net long tail loss reserves are tested using loss trend factors that AIG considers most appropriate for each class of business. A variety of actuarial methods and assumptions are normally employed to estimate net losses for long tail casualty lines. These methods ordinarily involve theuse of loss trend factors intended to reflect the estimated annual growth in loss costs from one accident year to the next. For the majority of long tail casualty lines, net loss trend factors approximated six percent. Loss trend factors reflect many items including changes in claims handling, exposure and policy forms; current and future estimates of monetary inflation and social inflation and increases in litigation and awards. These factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss experience. Thus, many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the year to year growth in loss costs recognized. A number of actuarial assumptions are made in the review of reserves for each line of business. For longer tail lines of business, actuarial assumptions generally are made with respect to the following:\\n•\\nLoss trend factors which are used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on the projected loss ratio for prior accident years. •\\nExpected loss ratios for the latest accident year (i.e., accident year 2003 for the year end 2003 loss reserve analysis) and in some cases, for accident years prior to the latest accident year. The expected loss ratio generally reflects the projected loss ratio from prior accident years, adjusted for the loss trend (See 1 above) and the impact of rate changes and other quantifiable factors. For low-frequency, high-severity classes such as Excess Casualty and Directors and Officers Liability (D & O), expected loss ratios generally are utilized for at least the three most recent accident years. •\\nLoss development factors which are used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate basis. AIG records quarterly changes in loss reserves for each of its many General Insurance profit centers. The overall change in AIG’s loss reserves is based on the sum of these profit center level changes. For most profit centers which write longer tail classes of casualty coverage, the process of recording quarterly loss reserve changes involves determining the estimated current loss ratio for each class of coverage. This loss ratio is multiplied by the current quarter’s net earned premium for that class of coverage to determine the quarter’s total estimated net incurred loss and loss expense. The change in loss reserves for the quarter for each class is thus the difference between the net incurred loss and loss expense, estimated as described above, and the net paid losses and loss expenses in the quarter. FORM 10-K : 25\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nThe process of determining the current loss ratio for each class or business segment begins in the profit centers in the latter part of the previous year. The loss ratios determined for each profit center are based on a variety of factors. These include, but are not limited to, the following considerations: prior accident year and policy year loss ratios; actual and anticipated rate changes; actual and anticipated changes in coverage, reinsurance, or mix of business; actual and anticipated changes in external factors impacting results, such as trends in loss costs or in the legal and claims environment. Each profit center’s loss ratio for the following year is subject to review by the profit center’s management, by actuarial and accounting staffs, and ultimately by senior management. At the close of each quarter, the assumptions underlying the loss ratios are reviewed to determine if the loss ratios based thereon remain appropriate. This process includes a review of the actual claims experience in the quarter, actual rate changes achieved, actual changes in coverage, reinsurance or mix of business, and changes in certain other factors that may affect the loss ratio. When this review suggests that the initially determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate, the loss ratio for current business would be changed to reflect the revised assumptions. A comprehensive annual loss reserve review is conducted in the fourth quarter of each year for each AIG General Insurance subsidiary. These reviews are conducted in full detail for each class or line of business for each subsidiary, and thus consist of literally hundreds of individual analyses. The purpose of these reviews is to confirm the reasonableness of the reserves carried by each of the individual subsidiaries, and thereby of AIG’s overall carried reserves. The reserve analysis for each business class is performed by the actuarial personnel who are most familiar with that class of business. In completing these detailed actuarial reserve analyses, the actuaries are required to make numerous assumptions, including for example the selection of loss development factors and loss cost trend factors. They are also required to determine and select the most appropriate actuarial method(s) to employ for each business class. Additionally, they must determine the appropriate segmentation of data or segments from which the adequacy of the reserves can be most accurately tested. In the course of these detailed reserve reviews for each business segment, a point estimate of the loss reserve is generally determined. The sum of these point estimates for each of the individual business classes for each subsidiary provides an overall actuarial point estimate of the loss reserve for that subsidiary. The overall actuarial point estimate is compared to the subsidiary’s carried loss reserve. If the carried reserve can be supported by actuarial methods and assumptions which are also believed to be reasonable, then the carried reserve wouldgenerally be considered reasonable and no adjustment would be considered. The ultimate process by which the actual carried reserves are determined considers not only the actuarial point estimate but a myriad of other factors.'),\n",

In the 2002 year-end actuarial loss reserve analysis for DBG, the more recent accident years showed significant increases in loss development for the excess casualty and directors and officers’ liability classes, as well as lesser amounts in certain other classes including healthcare liability. As a result, the actuaries performing the loss reserve analyses for these classes modified their historical assumptions in producing the point estimate of required reserves. A key modification was to give additional weight to the actual loss development in the immature years. For example, for the excess casualty lead umbrella class, the actual loss developments for accident year 1999 were used, even though that development normally would have been considered too immature to produce reliable results (and therefore, not used under historical assumptions). Another key change for the most recent accident years (generally accident years 2000, 2001 and 2002) was, although the actuaries continued to use actuarial assumptions that rely on expected loss ratios based on the results of prior accident years, the expected loss ratio assumptions used gave far greater weight to more recent accident year experience than was the case in the historical assumptions. Thus for the excess casualty lead umbrella class described above, the actuaries gave 100 percent weight to the results of the 1997 through 1999 accident years only, giving no weight to the more favorable development of all prior years, in setting expected loss ratio assumptions for accident years 2000 to 2002. Again, using the lead umbrella class as an example, rather than using the historical loss trend factor of 2.5 percent per year as actually experienced, the actuaries used 7.5 percent as the annual loss cost trend factor, reflecting the more current experience. As a result of the modified assumptions, the actuaries developed a second point estimate of the net loss reserve for DBG. (See “2002 Loss Reserve Charge” herein.)\\nWith respect to the 2003 year-end actuarial loss reserve analysis for DBG, the actuaries continued to utilize the modified assumptions as described above, with appropriate adjustments to account for the additional year of loss experience which emerged in 2003. For example, in setting the expected loss ratios for accident years 2001, 2002 and 2003 for the\\nFORM 10-K : 26\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nexcess casualty lead umbrella class, the actuaries gave 100 percent weight to the results of the 1997 through 2000 accident years only, giving no weight to the more favorable development of accident years prior to 1997. In addition, they continued to utilize the 7.5 percent annual loss cost trend factor. Loss development trends for long tail lines such as Excess Casualty and D&O, however, have not followed any consistent trend. This has at times led to overstated loss ratio projections and is a key reason why the actuaries have customarily utilized the historical projection method, which gave more weight to the experience of older, more mature accident years. For long tail lines, judgment is required in analyzing the appropriate weighting of current trends to avoid overreacting to data anomalies that may distort such current trends. Given the accuracy of the historical approach and the uncertainty of the more recent trends, AIG management decided to give approximately equal weight to the point estimate of the required reserve resulting from the historical assumptions and the point estimate of the required reserve from the modified assumptions described above in determining the actual loss reserve carried at year-end 2003. AIG’s annual loss reserve does not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates. Because AIG’s General Insurance business is primarily in long tail casualty lines driven almost entirely by severity rather than frequency of claims, developing a range around loss reserve estimates would not be meaningful. An estimate is calculated which AIG’s actuaries believe provides a reasonable estimate of the required reserve. This amount is evaluated against actual carried reserves. It must be understood that there is the potential for significant variation in the actual results versus the assumptions used to test the reserves, particularly for the long tail casualty classes of business such as excess casualty. As an example, for the lead umbrella segment of the excess casualty class of business, a 5 percent change in the assumed loss cost trend from each accident year to the next would cause approximately a $300 million impact (either positively or negatively) in the net loss and loss expense reserve position for that segment. In the early 1990’s actual loss cost trends were negative for the excess casualty class, whereas in the late 1990’s they spiked significantly and ran well into the double digits. Thus, while the 7.5 percent assumption used in the modified assumptions for both year-end 2002 and 2003 is believed to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that actual loss trends will not deviate significantly from this assumption. Another key assumption for long tail classes such as excess casualty is the loss development factors which are utilized to project thereported losses for each year to an ultimate basis. Generally, actual historical loss development factors are used to project future loss development. However, there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns will be the same as in the past. Again using the excess casualty class as an example, if future loss development factors differed by 5 percent from those utilized in the year-end 2003 loss reserve review, there would be approximately a $300 million impact to the overall AIG loss reserve position. In 2002, following completion of its annual year-end net loss reserve study, AIG increased General Insurance loss and loss adjustment reserves, incurring a net, after-tax charge of $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2002. The $1.8 billion was largely attributable to the “Other Liability Occurrence” and “Other Liability Claims Made” lines of business, and accident years 1997 through 2001. Asbestos and Environmental Reserves\\nAIG continues to receive claims asserting injuries from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites, referred to collectively as environmental claims, and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. The vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained an absolute exclusion for pollution related damage and an absolute asbestos exclusion was also implemented. However, AIG currently underwrites environmental impairment liability insurance on a claims made basis and has excluded such claims from this analyses. The majority of AIG’s exposures for asbestos and environmental claims are excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. Thus, the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity reserves. That is, litigation expenses are included within the limits of the liability AIG incurs. Individual significant claim liabilities, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case basis. Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a complex process. These asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated by AIG using conventional reserving techniques as previously described. Significant factors which affect the trends that influence the asbestos and environmental claims estimation process are the inconsistent court resolutions and judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage. The current case law can be characterized as still evolving and there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop in the\\nFORM 10-K : 27\\nAmerican International Group, Inc.'),\n",

Additionally, the exposure for cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites involve issues such as allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and the government’s refusal to release parties. Due to this uncertainty it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the same degree of reliability as is with other types of claims. Such future development will be affected by the extent to which courts continue to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage, as they have in the past, as well as by the changes in Superfund and waste dump site coverage issues. AIG and other industry members will continue to litigate the broadening judicial interpretation of the policy coverage and the liability issues. Although the estimated liabilities with respect to asbestos and environmental reserves are subject to a significantly greater margin of error than for other loss reserves, the asbestos and environmental reserves carried at December 31, 2003 are believed to be adequate as these reserves are based on the known facts and current law. Furthermore, as AIG’s net exposure retained relative to the gross exposure written was lower in 1984 and prior years, the potential impact of these claims is much smaller on the net loss reserves than on the gross loss reserves. However, if the asbestos and environmental reserves develop deficiently, such deficiency would have an adverse impact on future results of operations. (See the previous discussion on reinsurance collectibility herein.) AIG does not discount its asbestos and environmental reserves. With respect to known asbestos and environmental claims, AIG established over a decade ago specialized toxic tort and environmental claims units, which investigate and adjust all such asbestos and environmental claims. These units evaluate these asbestos and environmental claims utilizing a comprehensive ground up approach on a claim-by-claim basis. The asbestos and environmental claims are reserved to ultimate probable loss based upon known facts, current law, jurisdiction, policy language and other factors. Each claim is reviewed at least semi-annually utilizing the aforementioned approach and adjusted as necessary to reflect the current information. In both the specialized and dedicated asbestos and environmental claims units, AIG actively manages and pursues early settlement with respect to these claims thereby reducing its exposure to the unpredictable development of these claims. With respect to asbestos claims reserves, AIG has resolved all claims with respect to miners and major manufacturers (Tier 1), and payments have been completed or reserves are established to cover future payment obligations.Asbestos claims with respect to products containing asbestos (Tier 2), are generally very mature losses, and have been appropriately recognized and reserved by AIG’s asbestos claims operation. AIG believes that the vast majority of the incoming claims with respect to products containing small amounts of asbestos, companies in the distribution chain and parties with remote, ill-defined involvement with asbestos (Tier 3 and 4), should not impact its coverage. This is due to a combination of factors, including the increasingly peripheral companies being named in asbestos litigation, smaller limits issued to peripheral defendants, tenuous liability cases against peripheral defendants, attachment points of the excess policies, and the manner in which resolution of these weaker cases would be allocated among all insurers, including non-AIG companies, over a long period of time. AIG believes the majority of its known long-tail environmental exposures have been resolved utilizing a combination of pro-active claim-handling techniques including policy buybacks, complete environmental releases, compromise settlements, and, where indicated, litigation. Current and new claims are generally cases of declining severity. Strong coverage defenses (including late notice) and stronger liability defenses are among the factors contributing to declining severity. AIG uses primarily two methods to test the adequacy of its asbestos and environmental reserves, including the related IBNR, the Market Share method and the Frequency/ Severity method. The Market Share method produces indicated asbestos and environmental reserves needs by applying the appropriate AIG company market share to estimated potential industry ultimate loss and loss expenses based on the latest estimates from A.M.

The trend in severity starts with severities based on current actual average severity using the varying case adequacy assumptions and trending forward under assumptions deemed most reasonable by AIG. A similar frequency/ severity analysis is also performed for asbestos. However, future asbestos claims (IBNR) are projected for each of the next twenty years. Quantitative techniques frequently have to be supplemented by subjective consideration, including managerial judgment, to assure management satisfaction that the overall reserves are adequate to meet projected losses.

Best, an insurance rating agency, has developed a survival ratio to measure the number of years it would take a company to exhaust both its asbestos and environmental reserves for losses and loss expenses based on that company’s current level of asbestos and environmental claims payments. This is a ratio derived by taking the current ending losses and loss expense reserves and dividing by the average annual payments for the prior three years. Therefore, the ratio derived is a simplistic measure of an estimate of the number of years it would be before the current ending losses and loss expense reserves would be paid off using recent average payments. The higher the ratio, the more years the reserves for losses and loss expenses cover these claims payments. These ratios are computed based on the ending reserves for losses and lossexpenses over the respective claims settlement during the fiscal year. Such payments include indemnity payments and legal and loss adjustment payments. It should be noted, however, that this is an extremely simplistic approach to measuring asbestos and environmental reserve levels. Many factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of coverage provided, have a significant impact on the amount of asbestos and environmental losses and loss expense reserves, ultimate payments made and the resultant ratio. AIG believes that voluntary payments with respect to environmental claims should be excluded from the calculation of the survival ratio for the environmental claims. That is, involuntary payments are primarily attributable to court\\nFORM 10-K : 29\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\njudgments, court orders, covered claims with no coverage defenses, state mandated clean up costs, claims where AIG’s coverage defenses are minimal and settlements that are made less than six months before the first trial setting. Payments other than these are deemed voluntary because AIG can control the amount and timing of such payments, if any. AIG’s survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims, separately and combined, excluding voluntary environmental claim payments, were based upon a three year average payment. These ratios for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were as follows:\\nLife Insurance Operations\\nAIG’s Life Insurance subsidiaries offer a wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment products both domestically and abroad.

FORM 10-K : 30\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nLife Insurance Results\\nThe increase in operating income in 2003 was caused in part by strong growth, particularly overseas, and lower realized capital losses. The lower growth rate in 2002 was primarily a result of increased realized capital losses over 2001. The contribution of Life Insurance operating income to AIG’s consolidated income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes amounted to 43.2 percent in 2003 compared to 60.5 percent in 2002 and 57.4 percent in 2001. The decline in 2003 resulted from General Insurance operating income growing significantly. The contribution rate in 2002 and 2001 was influenced by the poor performance in General Insurance resulting in the reduced contribution of General Insurance to income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes. Since AIG purchased AIG Star Life, a part of the income earned by AIG Star Life has resulted from surrender charges earned on policies that were either surrendered or lapsed. This favorable impact on operating income was anticipated when AIG acquired AIG Star Life. As these surrenders diminish in subsequent years, operating income from that source will also diminish. The majority of AIG Star Life’s future income will be related to continuing premiums paid on renewal business, and new business to be generated from a growing agency force and new product sales to current insureds. Domestically, the growth is predominantly attributable to Pension and Investment Products, Life Insurance and Group Life/Health. With respect to Foreign Life, the majority of the growth in GAAP life premiums was attributable to the Life Insurance and Personal Accident lines of business. This growth was most significant in Southeast Asia where AIG maintains significant market share established by its strong agency force, and in Japan, where AIG is benefiting from a flight to quality. Foreign Life operations produced 78.0 percent, 77.3 percent and 74.0 percent of the GAAP life premiums in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. As previously discussed, the U.S. dollar weakened in relation to most major foreign currencies in which AIG transacts business. Accordingly, for 2003, when foreign life premiums were translated into U.S. dollars for purposes of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, total life premiums were approximately 2.6 percentage points more than they would have been if translated utilizing exchange rates prevailing in 2002. The growth in net investment income in 2003 was attributable to both foreign and domestic invested new cash flow for investment as well as improved returns on nontraditional investments. Domestically, this cash flow was generated from Life Insurance and individual annuity operations. Overseas, cash flow was generated primarily from Life Insurance operations. Additionally, net investment income was positively impacted by the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income. (See also the discussion under “Liquidity” herein.)\\nLife Insurance investment portfolios are managed within the overall objectives of the Life Insurance operations. Life Insurance realized capital losses reflect weaknesses in the equity markets in the early months of 2003 and the prior years as well as impairment loss provisions for certain equity and fixed income holdings. (See also the discussion on “Valuation of Invested Assets” herein.)\\nUnderwriting and Investment Risk\\nThe risks associated with the traditional life and accident and health products are underwriting risk and investment risk. The risk associated with the financial and investment contract products is primarily investment risk. Underwriting risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the actual policy experience adversely emerging in comparison to the assumptions made in the product pricing associated with mortality, morbidity, termination and expenses. The emergence of significant adverse experience would require an adjustment to the benefit reserves that could have a substantial impact with respect to AIG’s results of operations. AIG’s foreign life companies limit their maximum underwriting exposure on traditional life insurance of a single life to approximately $1.5 million of coverage and AIG’s domestic life companies generally limit their maximum underwriting exposure on traditional life insurance of a single life to $2.5 million of coverage by using yearly renewable term reinsurance. (See also Note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements and the discussion under “Liquidity” herein.)\\nThe investment risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the cash flows from the invested assets, primarily long-term fixed rate investments, being less than the cash flows required to meet the obligations of the expected policy and contract liabilities and the necessary return on investments. (See also the discussion under “Liquidity” herein.)\\nTo minimize its exposure to investment risk, AIG tests the cash flows from the invested assets and the policy and contract liabilities using various interest rate scenarios to assess whether there is a liquidity excess or deficit. If a rebalancing of the invested assets to the policy and contract claims became necessary and did not occur, a demand could be placed upon liquidity. (See also the discussion under “Liquidity” herein.)\\nFORM 10-K : 31\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nThe asset-liability relationship is appropriately managed in AIG’s foreign operations, as it has been throughout AIG’s history, even though certain territories lack qualified long-term investments or there are investment restrictions imposed by the local regulatory authorities. For example, in Japan and several Southeast Asia territories, the duration of the investments is often for a shorter period than the effective maturity of the related policy liabilities. Therefore, there is a risk that the reinvestment of the proceeds at the maturity of the initial investments may be at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of the policy liabilities. Additionally, there exists a future investment risk associated with certain policies currently in force which will have premium receipts in the future. That is, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities. To maintain an adequate yield to match the interest necessary to support future policy liabilities, constant management focus is required to reinvest the proceeds of the maturing securities and to invest the future premium receipts while continuing to maintain satisfactory investment quality. To the extent permitted under local regulation, AIG may invest in qualified longer-term securities outside Japan to achieve a closer matching in both duration and the required yield. AIG is able to manage any asset-liability duration difference through maintenance of sufficient global liquidity and to support any operational shortfall through its international financial network. (See also the discussion under “Liquidity” herein.)\\nCertain foreign jurisdictions have limited long-dated bond markets and AIG may use alternative investments, including equities and foreign denominated fixed income instruments to extend the effective duration of the investment portfolio to more closely match that of the policyholder liabilities. The asset-liability relationship is appropriately managed in AIG’s domestic operations, as there is ample supply of qualified long-term investments. AIG uses asset-liability matching as a management tool worldwide to determine the composition of the invested assets and appropriate marketing strategies. As a part of these strategies, AIG may determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position due to anticipated interest rate or other economic changes. A number of guaranteed benefits are offered on certain variable life products. (Included in the “Accounting Standards” section is a discussion of new accounting guidance for these benefits.)\\nDAC for life insurance products arises from the deferral of those costs that vary with, and are directly related to, the acquisition of new or renewal business. Policy acquisition costs for traditional life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period of the policy. Policy acquisition costs which relate to universal life and investment-type products (nontraditional life products) are deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the historical and future incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts. Estimated gross profits include investment income and gains and losses on investments less interest required as well as other charges in the contract less actual mortality and expenses. Current experience and changes in the expected future gross profits are analyzed to determine the impact on the amortization of DAC. The estimation of projected gross profits requires significant management judgment.'),\n",

(See also Note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nInsurance Invested Assets\\nAIG’s general strategy is to invest in high quality securities while maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure to issuer, industry and/or country concentrations. With respect to General Insurance, AIG’s strategy is to invest in longer duration fixed maturities to maximize the yields at the date of purchase. With respect to Life Insurance, AIG’s strategy is to produce cash flows required to meet maturing insurance liabilities. (See also the discussion under “Operating Review: Life Insurance Operations” herein.) AIG invests in equities for various reasons, including diversifying its overall exposure to interest rate risk. Equity securities are subject to declines in fair value. Such declines in fair value are presented in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments, net of taxes as a component of comprehensive income. Generally, insurance regulations restrict the types of assets in which an insurance company may invest. When permitted by regulatory authorities and when deemed necessary to protect insurance assets, including invested assets, from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, AIG and its insurance subsidiaries may enter into derivative transactions as end users.

Once a security has been identified as impaired, the amount of such impairment is determined by reference to that security’s contemporaneous market price. AIG has the ability to hold any security to its stated maturity. Therefore, the decision to sell reflects the judgment of AIG’s management that the security sold is unlikely to provide, on a relative value basis, as attractive a return in the future as alternative securities entailing comparable risks. With respect to distressed securities, the sale decision reflects management’s judgment that the risk-discounted anticipated ultimate recovery is less than the value achievable on sale. As a result of these policies, AIG recorded in 2003 impairment losses net of taxes of approximately $1.3 billion. No impairment charge with respect to any one single credit was significant to AIG’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations, and no individual impairment loss exceeded 1.3 percent of consolidated net income for 2003. Excluding the impairments noted above, the changes in market value for AIG’s available for sale portfolio, which constitutes the vast majority of AIG’s investments, were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as unrealized gains or losses. At December 31, 2003, the unrealized losses after taxes of the fixed maturity securities were approximately $1.4 billion. At December 31, 2003, the unrealized losses after taxes of the equity securities portfolio were approximately $44 million. At December 31, 2003, aggregate unrealized gains after taxes were $10.4 billion and aggregate unrealized losses after taxes were $1.5 billion. No single issuer accounted for more than three percent of the unrealized losses. At December 31, 2003, the fair value of AIG’s fixed maturities and equity securities aggregated to $319.0 billion. Of this aggregate fair value, 0.35 percent represented securities trading at or below 75 percent of amortized cost or cost. The impact on net income of unrealized losses after taxes will be further mitigated upon realization, because certain realized losses will be charged to participating policyholder accounts, or realization will result in current decreases in the amortization of certain deferred acquisition costs. At December 31, 2003, the unrealized losses after taxes for fixed maturity securities and equity securities included the following industry concentrations:\\nThe amortized cost of fixed maturities available for sale in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2003, by contractual maturity, is shown below:\\nIn the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, the pretax realized losses incurred with respect to the sale of fixed maturities and equity securities were $3.2 billion. The aggregate fair value of securities sold was $32.2 billion, which was approximately 91 percent of amortized cost. The average period of time that securities sold at a loss during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 were trading continuously at a price below book value was approximately seven months.

Aging of the pretax unrealized losses with respect to these securities, distributed as a percentage of cost relative to unrealized loss (the extent by which the market value is less than amortized cost or cost), including the number of respective items, was as follows:\\n(a)\\nFor bonds, represents amortized cost. (b)\\nAs more fully described above, upon realization, certain realized losses will be charged to participating policyholder accounts, or realization will result in a current decrease in the amortization of certain deferred acquisition costs. As stated previously, the valuation for AIG’s investment portfolio comes from market exchanges or dealer quotations, with the exception of nontraded securities. AIG considers nontraded securities to mean certain fixed income investments, certain structured securities, direct private equities, limited partnerships and hedge funds. The aggregate carrying value of these securities at December 31, 2003 was approximately $59.9 billion. The methodology used to estimate fair value of nontraded fixed income investments is by reference to traded securities with similar attributes and using a matrix pricing methodology. This technique takes into account such factors as the industry, the security’s rating and tenor, its coupon rate, its position in the capital structure of the issuer, and other relevant factors. The change in fair value is recognized as a component of unrealized appreciation. For certain structured securities, the carrying value is based on an estimate of the security’s future cash flows pursuant to the requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 99-20, “Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets.” The change in carrying value is recognized in income. Direct private equities, hedge funds and limited partnerships in which AIG holds in the aggregate less than a five percent interest, are carried at fair value. The change in fair value is recognized as a component of Other comprehensive income. With respect to hedge funds and limited partnerships in which AIG holds in the aggregate a five percent or greater interest, AIG’s carrying value is the net asset value. The changes in such net asset values are recorded in income. AIG obtains the fair value of its investments in limited partnerships and hedge funds from information provided by the sponsors of each of these investments, the accounts of which are generally audited on an annual basis.

Various valuation techniques are used with respect to each category in this determination. Financial Services Operations\\nAIG’s Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified financial products and services including aircraft leasing, capital market transactions, and consumer and insurance premium financing. (See also Note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nAIG’s Aircraft Finance operations represent the operations of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to domestic and foreign airlines. Revenues also result from the remarketing of commercial jets for its own account, for airlines and for financial institutions. ILFC finances its purchases of aircraft primarily through the issuance of a variety of debt instruments. The composite borrowing rates at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were 4.53 percent, 4.73 percent and 5.07 percent, respectively. (See also the discussions under “Capital Resources” and “Liquidity” herein and Notes 2 and 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nILFC is exposed to operating loss and liquidity strain through nonperformance of aircraft lessees, through owning aircraft which it would be unable to sell or re-lease at acceptable rates at lease expiration and, in part, through committing to purchase aircraft which it would be unable to lease. ILFC manages its lessee nonperformance exposure through credit reviews and security deposit requirements. As a result of these measures and its own contingency planning, ILFC did not suffer any material losses from airline shutdowns in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, but there can be no assurance that ILFC will successfully manage the risks relating to the impact of possible future deterioration in the airline industry. Over 80 percent of ILFC’s fleet is leased to non-U.S. carriers, and this fleet, comprised of the most efficient aircraft in the airline industry, continues to be in high demand from such carriers. ILFC typically contracts to re-lease aircraft before the end of the existing lease term. For aircraft returned before the end of the lease term, ILFC has generally been able to re-lease such aircraft within two to six months of its return. While some of the lease rates for aircraft that have been redeployed are lower, this is partially offset by low interest rates, which reduce ILFC’s financing costs. As a lessor, ILFC considers an aircraft “idle” or “off lease” when the aircraft is not subject to a signed lease agreement or signed letter of intent. ILFC had five aircraft off lease at December 31, 2003 which had been off lease for less than three months. As of March 8, 2004, all five of the five unleased aircraft were placed. All new aircraft deliveries in 2004 have been placed, and 67 percent of 2005 new aircraft deliveries have been leased. (See also the discussions under “Capital Resources” and “Liquidity” herein.)\\nDuring 2003, ILFC entered into a securitization of a portfolio of 37 aircraft. Certain of AIG’s Life Insurance and Retirement Services businesses purchased a large share of this securitization. A second securitization was executed in January, 2004. ILFC management is very active in the airline industry. Management formally reviews regularly, and no less frequently than quarterly, issues affecting ILFC’s fleet, including events and circumstances that may cause impairment of aircraft values. Management evaluates aircraft in the fleet as necessary, based on these events and circumstances in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (FAS 144). ILFC has not recognized any impairment related to its fleet, as the existing service potential of the aircraft in ILFC’s portfolio has not been diminished. Further, ILFC has been able to re-lease the aircraft without diminution in lease rates to an extent that would require an impairment write-down. (See also the discussions under “Liquidity” herein.)\\nAIG has integrated the operations of AIGTG into AIGFP thereby establishing the Capital Markets reporting unit. AIG believes that this will result in greater efficiencies and product synergies as well as growth opportunities. Capital Markets revenues and operating income increases were attributable primarily to its interest rate linked products. As Capital Markets is a transaction-oriented operation, current and past revenues and operating results may not provide a basis for predicting future performance. AIG’s Capital Markets operations derive substantially all their revenues from proprietary positions entered in connection with counterparty transactions rather than from speculative transactions. These subsidiaries participate in the derivatives dealer market conducting, primarily as principal, an interest rate, currency, equity, commodity and credit derivative products business. FORM 10-K : 36\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nAs dealers, AIGFP and AIGTG mark transactions to fair value daily. Thus, a gain or loss on each transaction is recognized daily. AIGFP and AIGTG hedge the market risks arising from their transactions. Therefore, revenues and operating income are not significantly exposed to or affected by market fluctuations and volatility. Revenues of the Capital Markets operations and the percentage change in revenues for any given period are significantly affected by the number and size of transactions entered into by these subsidiaries during that period relative to those entered into during the prior period. Operating income and the percentage change in operating income for any period are determined by the number, size and profitability of the transactions attributable to that period relative to those attributable to the prior period. Generally, the realization of trading revenues as measured by the receipt of funds is not a significant reporting event as the gain or loss on Capital Markets trading transactions are currently reflected in operating income as the fair values change from period to period. Derivative transactions are entered into in the ordinary course of Capital Markets operations. Therefore, income on interest rate, equity, commodity and credit derivatives along with their related hedges are recorded on a mark to market value or at estimated fair value where market prices are not readily available with the resulting unrealized gains or losses reflected in the income statement in the current year. In 2003, less than five percent of revenues resulted from transactions valued at estimated fair value. The mark to fair value of derivative transactions is reflected in the balance sheet in the captions “Unrealized gain on interest rate and currency swaps, options and forward transactions” and “Unrealized loss on interest rate and currency swaps, options and forward transactions”. The unrealized gain represents the present value of the aggregate of each net receivable by counterparty, and the unrealized loss represents the present value of the aggregate of each net payable by counterparty as of December 31, 2003. These amounts will change from one period to the next due to changes in interest rates, currency rates, equity prices and other market variables, as well as cash movements, execution of new transactions and the maturing of existing transactions. (See also the discussion under “Derivatives” herein and Note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements.) Spread income on investments and borrowings are recorded on an accrual basis over the life of the transaction. Investments are classified as available for sale securities and are marked to market with the resulting unrealized gains or losses reflected in shareholders’ equity. Domestically, AIG’s consumer finance operations derive a substantial portion of their revenues from finance charges assessed on outstanding mortgages, home equity loans, secured and unsecured consumer loans and retail merchant financing. Overseas operations provide credit cards, personal and auto loans, term deposits, savings accounts, sales finance and mortgages with an emphasis on emerging markets. Consumer finance operations are exposed to loss when contractual payments are not received.'),\n",

Financial Services operations for 2003, 2002 and 2001 were as follows:\\n(a)\\nRevenues were primarily from ILFC aircraft lease rentals. (b)\\nRevenues were primarily fees from AIGFP and AIGTG proprietary positions entered into in connection with counterparty transactions. (c)\\nRevenues were primarily finance charges. Financial Services Results\\nCapital Market activities were the primary reason for the growth in operating income in 2003 and to a lesser extent in 2002. Financial Services operating income represented 17.7 percent of AIG’s consolidated income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes in 2003. This compares to 26.9 percent and 24.5 percent in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in contribution percentage was influenced by the impact that the General Insurance loss reserve charge in 2002 and the WTC losses in 2001 had on General Insurance operating income and the reduced contribution of General Insurance operations to income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes in those years. With respect to ILFC, the revenue growth in each year resulted primarily from the increase in flight equipment under operating lease and the increase in the relative cost of the leased fleet. The decline in ILFC’s operating income for 2003 was largely a result of the decline in aircraft remarketing due to the poor market conditions for secondhand aircraft. Going forward, AIG believes that ILFC’s performance will improve as the improvements in the airline industry are not yet being reflected in ILFC’s results.

The percentages for operating income are the same as those for revenues because expenses are allocated across all products in proportion to the revenues generated by that product. Material changes in the distribution of revenues and operating income from period to period are not unusual due to the transactional nature of Capital Markets’ business. Financial market conditions in 2003 compared with 2002 were characterized by lower interest rates across fixed income markets globally, a tightening of credit spreads, and higher equity valuations. Capital Markets’ results in 2003 compared with 2002 reflected a shift in product segment activity to respond to these conditions. In particular, Capital Markets experienced increases in demand for interest and currency linked products that addressed the risk management needs of its counterparties. (See also Note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nThe most significant component of Capital Markets’ operating expenses is compensation, which approximated 33 percent, 36 percent and 33 percent of revenues in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Consumer Finance revenues in 2003 increased. The increase in revenues in 2003 was the result of growth in average finance receivables and credit quality continues to be strong. Further, reductions of the cost to borrow led to an improvement in the operating income over the previous year. The decline in revenues in 2002 was the result of lower yields on the finance receivables, but borrowing costs also declined significantly so that spreads, and therefore operating income, increased as a result. Financial Services Invested Assets\\nThe following table is a summary of the composition of AIG’s Financial Services invested assets at December 31, 2003 and 2002. (See also the discussions under “Operating Review: Financial Services Operations”, “Capital Resources” and “Derivatives” herein.)\\nAs previously discussed, the cash used for the purchase of flight equipment is derived primarily from the proceeds of ILFC’s debt financings. The primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are the cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of flight equipment and the rollover and refinancing of the prior debt. During 2003, ILFC acquired flight equipment costing $5.51 billion. (See also the discussion under “Operating Review: Financial Services Operations” and “Capital Resources” herein.)\\nAt December 31, 2003, ILFC had committed to purchase 463 new and used aircraft deliverable from 2004 through 2010 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $26.2 billion and had options to purchase 11 new aircraft deliverable from 2004 through 2008 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $705 million. As of March 8, 2004, ILFC has entered into leases for all of the new aircraft to be delivered in 2004 and 61 of 91 of the new aircraft to be delivered in 2005 and 30 of 263 of the new aircraft to be delivered subsequent to 2005. ILFC will be required to find customers for any aircraft presently on order and any aircraft to be ordered, and it must arrange financing for portions of the purchase price of such equipment. In a rising interest rate environment, ILFC negotiates higher lease rates on any new contracts. ILFC has been successful to date both in placing its new aircraft on lease or under sales contract and obtaining adequate financing, but there can be no assurance that such success will continue in future environments. FORM 10-K : 38\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nAIG’s Consumer Finance operations provide a wide variety of consumer finance products both domestically and overseas. Such products include real estate mortgages, consumer loans, and retail sales finance. These products are funded through various borrowings including commercial paper and medium term notes. AIG’s Consumer Finance operations are exposed to credit risk and risk of loss resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates. Over half of the loan balance is related to real estate loans which are substantially collateralized by the related properties. With respect to credit losses, the allowance for finance receivable losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to absorb anticipated credit losses existing in that portfolio.'),\n",

AIGFP reduces its economic risk exposure through similarly valued offsetting transactions including swaps, trading securities, options, forwards and futures. The estimated fair values of these transactions represent assessments of the present value of expected future cash flows. These transactions are exposed to liquidity risk if AIGFP were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes that the impact of any such limited liquidity would not be significant to AIG’s financial condition or its overall liquidity. (See also the discussion under “Operating Review: Financial Services Operations” and “Derivatives” herein.)\\nAIGFP uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes and bonds and GIA borrowings to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities, including securities available for sale, at market, and derivative transactions. The funds may also be temporarily invested in securities purchased under agreements to resell. The proceeds from the disposal of the aforementioned securities available for sale and securities purchased under agreements to resell have been used to fund the maturing GIAs or other AIGFP financings.

ILFC has substantially eliminated the currency exposure arising from foreign currency denominated notes by either hedging the notes through swaps or through the offset provided by operating lease payments. Notes issued under this program are included in Notes and Bonds Payable in the preceding table of borrowings. ILFC had a $4.3 billion Export Credit Facility for use in connection with the purchase of approximately 75 aircraft delivered through 2001. This facility was guaranteed by various European Export Credit Agencies. The interest rate varies from 5.75 percent to 5.90 percent on these borrowings depending on the delivery date of the aircraft. At December 31, 2003, ILFC had $1.8 billion outstanding under this facility. The debt is collateralized by a pledge of the shares of a subsidiary of ILFC, which holds title to the aircraft financed under the facility. During 2003, ILFC entered into various bank financings for a total funded amount of $1.3 billion. The financings mature through 2009.'),\n",

(See also the discussions under “Operating Review” and “Liquidity” herein.)\\nAIGFP has established a Euro Medium Term Note Program under which an aggregate principal amount of up to $4.0 billion of notes may be outstanding. As of December 31, 2003, $4.73 billion of notes had been issued under the program, $3.23 billion of which were outstanding. Notes issued under this program are included in Notes and Bonds Payable in the preceding table of borrowings. During 2003, AIG did not issue any medium term notes, and $207 million of previously issued notes matured or were redeemed. At December 31, 2003, AIG had $140 million in aggregate principal amount of debt securities registered for issuance from time to time. AIG has filed a universal shelf registration statement to sell up to $5.1 billion of debt securities, preferred and common stock and other securities. AIG has no current plans to issue the equity, equity-linked or capital securities included in the registration statement, but intends to continue its customary practice of issuing securities from time to time for general corporate purposes. FORM 10-K : 42\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nOn November 9, 2001, AIG received proceeds of approximately $1 billion from the issuance of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2031 with an aggregate principal amount at maturity of approximately $1.52 billion. Commencing January 1, 2002, the debentures are convertible into shares of AIG common stock at a conversion rate of 6.0627 shares per $1,000 principal amount of debentures if AIG common stock trades at certain levels for certain time periods. The debentures are callable by AIG on or after November 9, 2006. Also, holders can require AIG to repurchase these debentures once every five years beginning on November 9, 2006. As of November 2001, AIG guaranteed the notes and bonds of AGC. During 2002, AGC issued $200 million in notes which matured in March 2003. Shareholders’ Equity\\nAIG’s shareholders’ equity increased $12.15 billion during 2003. Unrealized appreciation of investments, net of taxes increased $2.99 billion and the cumulative translation adjustment loss, net of taxes, decreased $306 million. The change for 2003 with respect to the unrealized appreciation of investments, net of taxes, was primarily impacted by the decrease in domestic interest rates. During 2003, there was a gain of $325 million, net of taxes relating to derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments. (See also the discussion under “Operating Review” and “Liquidity” herein, Notes 1(z) and 8(d) of Notes to Financial Statements and the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.) During 2003, retained earnings increased $8.69 billion, resulting from net income less dividends. Stock Repurchase\\nDuring 2003, AIG repurchased in the open market 3,822,500 shares of its common stock. AIG intends to continue to buy its common shares in the open market for general corporate purposes, including to satisfy its obligations under various employee benefit plans. Dividends from Insurance Subsidiaries\\nPayments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by statutory authorities. With respect to AIG’s domestic insurance subsidiaries, specifically the payment of any dividend requires formal notice to the insurance department in which the particular insurance subsidiary is domiciled. Under the laws of many states, an insurer may pay a dividend without prior approval of the insurance regulator when the amount of the dividend is below certain materiality thresholds. As a result of these regulations, approximately 71 percent of consolidated shareholders’ equity was restricted as to immediate payment by insurance subsidiaries to AIG parent at December 31, 2003. With respect to AIG’s foreign insurance subsidiaries, the most significant insurance regulatory jurisdictions include Bermuda, Japan, Hong Kong and the Republic of China. AIG has in the past reinvested most of its unrestricted earnings in its operations and believes such continued reinvestment in the future will be adequate to meet any foreseeable capital needs. However, AIG may choose from time to time to raise additional funds through the issuance of additional securities. At December 31, 2003, there were no significant statutory or regulatory issues which would impair AIG’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, but there can be no assurance that such issues will not arise in the future. To AIG’s knowledge, no AIG company is on any regulatory or similar “watch list”. (See also the discussion under “Liquidity” herein and Note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nRegulation and Supervision\\nAIG’s insurance subsidiaries, in common with other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has developed Risk-Based Capital (RBC) requirements. RBC relates an individual insurance company’s statutory surplus to the risk inherent in its overall operations. At December 31, 2003, the risk-based adjusted surplus of each of AIG’s domestic general companies and of each of AIG’s domestic life companies exceeded each of their RBC standards. Federal, state or local legislation may affect AIG’s ability to operate and expand its various financial services businesses and changes in the current laws, regulations or interpretations thereof may have a material adverse effect on these businesses. AIG’s operations are negatively impacted under guarantee fund assessment laws which exist in most states. As a result of operating in a state which has guarantee fund assessment laws, a solvent insurance company may be assessed for certain obligations arising from the insolvencies of other insurance companies which operated in that state. AIG generally records these assessments upon notice.'),\n",

This participation is also recorded upon notification, as these amounts cannot reasonably be estimated. A substantial portion of AIG’s General Insurance business and a majority of its Life Insurance business are conducted in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies from minimal in some to stringent in others. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must\\nsatisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. Thus, AIG’s insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. AIG’s international operations include operations in various developing nations. Both current and future foreign operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable political developments up to and including nationalization of AIG’s operations without compensation.

Rating triggers generally relate to events which (i) could result in the termination or limitation of credit availability, or require accelerated repayment, (ii) could result in the termination of business contracts or (iii) could require a company to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties. Special Purpose Vehicles and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements\\nAIG uses special purpose vehicles (SPVs) and off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business. As a result of recent changes in accounting, a number of SPVs and off balance sheet arrangements have been reflected in AIG’s consolidated financial statements. In January 2003, FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (FIN 46). FIN46 addressed the consolidation and disclosure rules for nonoperating entities that are now defined as Variable Interest Entities (VIEs). In December 2003, FASB issued a revision to Interpretation No.'),\n",

Also, for additional disclosure regarding AIG’s commercial commitments (including guarantors), see “Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments” herein. AIG has restrictive guidelines with respect to the formation of and investment in SPVs and off balance sheet arrangements. Liquidity\\nAIG’s liquidity is primarily derived from the operating cash flows of its General and Life Insurance operations. At December 31, 2003, AIG’s consolidated invested assets included $9.84 billion of cash and short-term investments. Consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in 2003 amounted to $36.16 billion. Sources of funds considered in meeting the objectives of AIG’s Financial Services operations include guaranteed investment agreements, issuance of long-term and short-term debt, maturities and sales of securities available for sale, securities sold under repurchase agreements, trading liabilities, securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased, issuance of equity, and cash provided from such operations. AIG’s strong capital position and superior credit ratings are integral to managing this liquidity, as they enable AIG to raise funds in diverse markets worldwide. (See also the discussion under “Capital Resources” herein.)\\nManagement believes that AIG’s liquid assets, its net cash provided by operations, and access to the capital markets will enable it to meet any foreseeable cash requirements. The liquidity of the combined insurance operations is derived both domestically and abroad. The combined insurance operating cash flow is derived from two sources, underwriting operations and investment operations. In the aggregate, AIG’s insurance operations generated approximately $53.3 billion in pretax cash flow during 2003. Cash flow includes periodic premium collections, including policyholders’ contract deposits, cash flows from investment operations and paid loss recoveries less reinsurance premiums, losses, benefits, and acquisition and operating expenses. Generally, there is a time lag from when premiums are collected and, when as a result of the occurrence of events specified in the policy, the losses and benefits are paid. AIG’s insurance investment operations generated approximately $17.1 billion in investment income cash flow during 2003. Investment income cash flow is primarily derived from interest and dividends received and includes realized capital gains net of realized capital losses. (See also the discussions under “Operating Review: General Insurance Operations” and “Life Insurance Operations” herein.)\\nWith respect to General Insurance operations, if paid losses accelerated beyond AIG’s ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows, AIG would need to liquidate a portion of its General Insurance investment portfolio and/or arrange for financing. Potential events causing such a liquidity strain could be the result of several significant catastrophic events occurring in a relatively short period of time. Additional strain on liquidity could occur if the investments sold to fund such paid losses were sold into a depressed market place and/or reinsurance recoverable on such paid losses became uncollectible or collateral supporting such reinsurance recoverable significantly decreased in value. (See also the discussions under “Operating Review: General Insurance Operations” herein.)\\nWith respect to Life Insurance operations, if a substantial portion of the Life Insurance operations bond portfolio diminished significantly in value and/or defaulted, AIG would need to liquidate other portions of its Life Insurance investment portfolio and/or arrange financing. Potential events causing such a liquidity strain could be the result of economic\\nFORM 10-K : 45\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\ncollapse of a nation or region in which AIG Life Insurance operations exist, nationalization, terrorist acts or other such economic or political upheaval. (See also the discussions under “Operating Review: Life Insurance Operations” herein.)\\nIn addition to the combined insurance pretax operating cash flow, AIG’s insurance operations held $8.41 billion in cash and short-term investments at December 31, 2003. Operating cash flow and the cash and short-term balances held provided AIG’s insurance operations with a significant amount of liquidity. This liquidity is available, among other things, to purchase predominately high quality and diversified fixed income securities and, to a lesser extent, marketable equity securities, and to provide mortgage loans on real estate, policy loans and collateral loans. This cash flow coupled with proceeds of approximately $122 billion from the maturities, sales and redemptions of fixed income securities and from the sale of equity securities was used to purchase approximately $169 billion of fixed income securities and marketable equity securities during 2003. Managing Market Risk\\nInsurance\\nAIG’s insurance operations are exposed to market risk. Market risk is the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices. Measuring potential losses in fair values is performed through the application of various statistical techniques. One such technique is Value at Risk (VaR). VaR is a summary statistical measure that uses historical interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices and estimates the volatility and correlation of each of these rates and prices to calculate the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time given a certain probability. AIG believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk. While VaR models are relatively sophisticated, the quantitative market risk information generated is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related models. Therefore, such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management. AIG has performed a VaR analysis to estimate the maximum potential loss of fair value for each of AIG’s insurance segments and for each market risk within each insurance segment. In this analysis, financial instrument assets include the domestic and foreign invested assets excluding real estate and investment income due and accrued. Financial instrument liabilities include reserve for losses and loss expenses, reserve for unearned premiums, future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and policyholders’ funds. Due to the nature of each insurance segment, AIG manages the General and Life Insurance operations separately. As a result, AIG manages separately the invested assets of each. Accordingly, the VaR analysis was separately performed for the General and the Life Insurance operations. AIG calculated the VaR with respect to the net fair value of each of AIG’s insurance segments as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002. AIG uses the historical simulation methodology which entails repricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period. In this case, the most recent three years of historical market information for interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity index prices were used to construct the historical scenarios. For each scenario, each transaction was repriced.'),\n",

The final VaR number represents the maximum potential loss incurred by these scenarios with 95 percent confidence (i.e., only 5 percent of historical scenarios show losses greater than the VaR figure). A one month holding period was assumed in computing the VaR figure. The significant increases in VaR in 2003 resulted primarily from the higher volatility with respect to interest rates during 2003 and the increase in the size of the invested assets portfolios. The following table presents the VaR on a combined basis and of each component of market risk for each of AIG’s insurance segments as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002. VaR with respect to combined operations cannot be derived by aggregating the individual risk or segment amounts presented herein.

Financial Services\\nMarket risk arises principally from the uncertainty that future earnings are exposed to potential changes in volatility, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices. AIG generally controls its exposure to market risk by taking offsetting positions. AIG’s philosophy with respect to its Capital Markets operations is to minimize or set limits for open or uncovered positions that are to be carried. Credit risk exposure is separately managed. (See the discussion on the management of credit risk below.)\\nAIG’s Market Risk Management Department provides detailed independent review of AIG’s market exposures, particularly those market exposures of the Capital Markets operations. This department determines whether AIG’s market risks, as well as those market risks of individual subsidiaries, are within the parameters established by AIG’s senior management. Well established market risk management techniques such as sensitivity analysis are used. Additionally, this department verifies that specific market risks of each of certain subsidiaries are managed and hedged by that subsidiary. ILFC is exposed to market risk and the risk of loss of fair value and possible liquidity strain resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates. As of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, AIG statistically measured the loss of fair value through the application of a VaR model. In this analysis, the net fair value of Aircraft Finance operations was determined using the financial instrument assets which included the tax adjusted future flight equipment lease revenue and the financial instrument liabilities which included the future servicing of the current debt. The estimated impact of the current derivative positions was also taken into account. AIG calculated the VaR with respect to the net fair value of Aircraft Finance operations using the historical simulation methodology, as previously described. As of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, the average VaR with respect to the net fair value of Aircraft Finance operations was approximately $38 million and $20 million, respectively. Capital Markets operations are exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices.'),\n",

Derivatives payments may be based on interest rates and exchange rates and/or prices of certain securities, certain commodities, or financial or commodity indices. The more significant types of derivative arrangements in which AIG transacts are swaps, forwards, futures and options. In the normal course of business, with the agreement of the original counterparty, these contracts may be terminated early or assigned to another counter-party. FORM 10-K : 48\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nThe overwhelming majority of AIG’s derivatives activities are conducted by the Capital Markets operations, thus permitting AIG to participate in the derivatives dealer market acting primarily as principal. In these derivative operations, AIG structures agreements which generally allow its counterparties to enter into transactions with respect to changes in interest and exchange rates, securities’ prices and certain commodities and financial or commodity indices. AIG’s customers such as corporations, financial institutions, multinational organizations, sovereign entities, government agencies and municipalities use derivatives to hedge their own market exposures. For example, a futures, forward or option contract can be used to protect the customers’ assets or liabilities against price fluctuations. A counterparty may default on any obligation to AIG, including a derivative contract. Credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and/or carrying trading and investment positions. Credit risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to AIG. To help manage this risk, the credit departments of AIGFP and AIGTG operate within the guidelines set by the AIG Credit Risk Committee. This committee establishes the credit policy, sets limits for counterparties and provides limits for derivative transactions with counterparties having different credit ratings. In addition to credit ratings, this committee takes into account other factors, including the industry and country of the counterparty. Transactions which fall outside these pre-established guidelines require the approval of the AIG Credit Risk Committee. It is also AIG’s policy to establish reserves for potential credit impairment when necessary. AIG’s Derivatives Review Committee provides an independent review of any proposed derivative transaction. The committee examines, among other things, the nature and purpose of the derivative transaction, its potential credit exposure, if any, and the estimated benefits. This committee does not review those derivative transactions entered into by Capital Markets for their own accounts. Generally, AIG conducts its businesses in the currencies of the local operating environment. Thus, exchange gains or losses occur when AIG’s foreign currency net investment is affected by changes in the foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar from one reporting period to the next. Legal risk arises from the uncertainty of the enforceability, through legal or judicial processes, of the obligations of AIG’s clients and counterparties, including contractual provisions intended to reduce credit exposure by providing for the netting of mutual obligations. See also Note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements for detailed information relating to Capital Markets derivative activities. Accounting Standards\\nIn November 2002, FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (FIN 45). FIN 45 requires that, for guarantees within its scope that are issued or amended after December 31, 2002, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee be established, and recognized through earnings. To date, the impact on earnings for AIG has not been and is not expected to be material. AIG guarantees the indebtedness of third parties principally in connection with AIG SunAmerica’s investments in affordable housing properties. The guarantees are issued primarily to facilitate financing for the construction of the underlying properties, and have durations of up to ten years. Since the inception of this investment program over ten years ago, payments under these guarantees have been insignificant because the loans are first backed by the creditworthiness of the third party general partner, and secondly, are secured by the underlying properties. The maximum exposure before consideration of the applicable security under these guarantees as of December 31, 2003 is approximately $2.4 billion. In addition, AIG’s real estate investment operations will occasionally extend guarantees to real estate partnerships in which they are an investor. The guarantees facilitate financing for the construction and/or purchase of land. There have been no payments to date under these guarantees as the loans are first backed by the creditworthiness of the third party general partner, and secondly, are secured by the underlying properties. The maximum exposure before consideration of the applicable security under these guarantees as of December 31, 2003 is approximately $112 million. Through ILFC, AIG has also provided other types of guarantees. From time to time, ILFC participates with airlines, banks and other financial institutions to assist in financing aircraft by providing asset guarantees, put options or loan guarantees. Historically, losses arising from these guarantees have not been material, as ILFC has recourse to the value of the underlying aircraft, which offsets ILFC’s exposure, should ILFC be called upon to fulfill its obligations under these guarantees. The maximum exposure related to these guarantees as of December 31, 2003, before consideration of the applicable security, is approximately $897 million.

FIN 46 changes the method of determining whether certain entities should be consolidated in AIG’s consolidated financial statements. An entity is subject to FIN 46 and is called a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) if it has (i) equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (ii) equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entity’s operations, or that do not absorb the expected losses or receive the expected returns of the entity. A VIE is consolidated by its primary beneficiary, which is the party that has a majority of the expected losses or a majority of the expected residual returns of the VIE, or both. All other entities not considered VIEs are evaluated for consolidation under existing guidance. In December 2003, FASB issued a revision to Interpretation No.'),\n",

The provisions of FIN46R are to be applied immediately to VIEs created after January 31, 2003, and to VIEs in which AIG obtains an interest after that date. For VIEs in which AIG holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003, FIN46R was applied as of December 31, 2003. For any VIEs that must be consolidated under FIN 46R that were created before February 1, 2003, the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the VIEs would be initially measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. In accordance with the transition provisions of FIN 46R, AIG recorded in its consolidated income statement for the fourth quarter of 2003 a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment gain of $9 million ($14 million before tax). In addition, AIG recorded in its consolidated balance sheet approximately $4.7 billion of assets and liabilities. (See also Note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nIn May 2003, FASB issued Financial Accounting Standard No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity” (FAS 150). FAS 150 requires certain financial instruments previously classified as either entirely equity or between the liabilities section and the equity section of the balance sheet be classified as liabilities. FAS 150 requires issuers to classify as liabilities the following three types of freestanding financial instruments: mandatory redeemable financial instruments; obligations to repurchase the issuer’s equity shares by transferring assets; and certain obligations to issue a variable number of shares. FAS 150 was effective for the quarter ending September 30, 2003. As of December 31, 2003, $1.68 billion of preferred instruments previously classified on AIG’s consolidated balance sheet as “Preferred shareholders’ equity in subsidiary companies” is now classified in the liability caption entitled “Preferred shareholders’ equity in subsidiary companies subject to mandatory redemption.” Restatement of financial statements for prior periods is not permitted. In July 2003, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position 03-1, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts” (SOP 03-1). This statement is effective as of January 1, 2004, and will require AIG to recognize a liability for guaranteed minimum death benefits and other living benefits related to its variable annuity and variable life contracts and to modify certain disclosures and financial statement presentations for these products. In the first quarter of 2004, AIG will report a one-time cumulative accounting charge upon adoption of $181 million ($278 million pretax to reflect the liability as of January 1, 2004). With respect to the balance sheet presentation, the non-U.S. portion of AIG’s separate and variable account assets and liabilities will be reclassified to several invested asset captions and the policyholders’ contract deposits liability caption, respectively.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\n(a) Principles of Consolidation: On August 29, 2001 American General Corporation (AGC), was acquired by American International Group, Inc. (AIG). In connection with the acquisition, AIG issued approximately 290 million shares of its common stock in exchange for all the outstanding common stock of AGC based on an exchange ratio of 0.5790 of a share of AIG common stock for each share of AGC common stock. The acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests and the accompanying financial statements have been prepared to retroactively combine AGC’s financial statements with AIG’s financial statements for all periods presented. All of the share information included herein reflects the application of the exchange ratio to the number of shares of AGC common stock outstanding at the relevant times rather than the number of shares of AIG common stock actually issued or outstanding at such times. In addition, AGC convertible preferred stock has been included based on its AGC common stock equivalent in the restated capital accounts. AIG subsidiaries write property, casualty, marine, life and financial lines insurance in approximately 130 countries and jurisdictions. Certain of AIG’s foreign subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements report on a fiscal year ending November 30. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AIG, its majority owned subsidiaries and those entities required to be consolidated under applicable accounting standards. (See also Note 1(bb) herein). All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. (b) Basis of Presentation: The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.'),\n",

Acquisition costs represent those costs, including commissions, that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new business. These costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums written are earned. The deferred acquisition cost (DAC) asset is reviewed for recoverability based on the profitability of the underlying insurance contracts. Investment income is not anticipated in the deferral of acquisition costs. Losses and loss expenses are charged to income as incurred. The reserve for losses and loss expenses represents the accumulation of estimates for reported losses and includes provisions for losses incurred but not reported. The methods of determining such estimates and establishing resulting reserves, including amounts relating to reserves for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance, are reviewed and updated. Adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in income currently. AIG discounts certain of its loss reserves primarily related to workers’ compensation and other business lines where permitted by regulatory authorities. The total amount of discount is less than three percent of outstanding loss reserves as reflected on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Life Insurance Operations: AIG’s Life Insurance subsidiaries offer a wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment products. Traditional products consist of individual and group life, annuity, endowment and accident and health policies. Financial and investment products consist of single premium annuity, guaranteed investment contracts, universal life and pensions. Premiums for traditional life insurance products and life contingent annuities, excluding accident and health products, are recognized as revenues when due. Estimates for premiums due but not yet collected are accrued. Benefits and expenses are provided against such revenues to recognize profits over the estimated life of the policies. Revenues for universal life and investment-type products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, administration and surrenders during the period. Policy charges collected with respect to future services are deferred and recognized in a manner similar to the deferred policy acquisition costs related to such products. Expenses include interest credited to policy account balances and benefit payments made in excess of policy account balances. Personal accident products are accounted for in a manner similar to general insurance products described above. Certain foreign jurisdictions have limited long-dated bond markets and AIG may use alternative investments, including equities and foreign denominated fixed income instruments, to extend the effective duration of the investment portfolio to more closely match that of the policyholders’ liabilities. Policy acquisition costs for traditional life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period of the policy. Policy acquisition costs\\nFORM 10-K : 60\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\\nand policy initiation costs related to universal life and investment-type products (nontraditional products) are deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts. Estimated gross profits are composed of net interest income, net realized investment gains and losses, variable annuity fees, surrender charges and direct administrative expenses. The resulting DAC asset is reviewed for recoverability based on the profitability (both current and projected future) of the underlying insurance contracts. The deferred acquisition costs with respect to nontraditional products are adjusted with respect to estimated gross profits as a result of changes in the net unrealized gains or losses on debt and equity securities available for sale. That is, as debt and equity securities available for sale are carried at aggregate fair value, an adjustment is made to deferred policy acquisition costs equal to the change in amortization that would have been recorded if such securities had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields. The change in this adjustment, net of tax, is included with the change in net unrealized gains/losses on debt and equity securities available for sale that is credited or charged directly to comprehensive income. Deferred policy acquisition costs have been decreased by $2.05 billion at December 31, 2003 and decreased by $1.23 billion at December 31, 2002 for this adjustment. (See also Note 4 herein.)\\nThe liabilities for future policy benefits and policyholders’ contract deposits are established using assumptions described in Note 6. Financial Services Operations: AIG participates in the derivatives dealer market conducting, primarily as principal, an interest rate, currency, equity, commodity and credit derivative products business. AIG also enters into structured transactions, including long-dated forward foreign exchange contracts, option transactions, liquidity facilities and investment agreements, and invests in a diversified portfolio of securities. AIG engages in market making and trading activities, as principal, in foreign exchange, interest rates and precious and base metals. AIG owns inventories in the commodities in which it trades and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the use of swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts. AIG, as lessor, leases flight equipment principally under operating leases. Accordingly, income is recognized over the life of the lease as rentals become receivable under the provisions of the lease or, in the case of leases with varying payments, under the straight-line method over the noncancelable term of the lease. In certain cases, leases provide for additional payments contingent on usage. Rental income is recognized at the time such usage occurs less a provision for future contractual aircraft maintenance. AIG is also a remarketer of flight equipment for its own account and for airlines and financial institutions, and provides, for a fee, fleet management services to certain third-party operators. AIG’s revenues from such operations consist of net gains on sales of flight equipment and commissions. AIG provides a wide variety of consumer finance products, including mortgages, personal and auto loans, retail sales finance and credit related insurance. Finance charges are recognized as revenue using the interest method. Revenue ceases to be accrued when contractual payments are not received for four consecutive months for loans and retail sales contracts, and for six months for revolving retail accounts and private label receivables. Extension fees, late charges, and prepayment penalties are recognized as revenue when received. Direct costs of originating loans, net of nonrefundable points and fees, are deferred and included in the carrying amount of the related loans. The amount deferred is recognized as an adjustment to finance charge revenues, using the interest method over the lesser of the contractual term or the expected life based on prepayment experience. If loans are prepaid, any remaining deferral is charged or credited to revenue. Foreclosure proceedings are initiated on real estate loans when four monthly installments are past due and these loans are charged off at foreclosure. All other finance receivables are charged off when minimal or no collections have been made for six months. The allowance for finance receivable losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to absorb anticipated credit losses in the existing portfolio. The portfolio is periodically evaluated on a pooled basis and considers factors such as economic conditions, portfolio composition, and loss and delinquency experience in the evaluation of the allowance. Retirement Services & Asset Management Operations: AIG’s Retirement Services & Asset Management operations offer a wide variety of investment vehicles and services, including variable annuities, mutual funds and investment asset management. Such products and services are offered to individuals and institutions both domestically and internationally. The fees generated with respect to Retirement Services & Asset Management operations are recognized as revenues when earned. Costs incurred in the sale of variable annuities and mutual funds are deferred and subsequently amortized. With respect to variable annuities, acquisition costs are amortized in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the variable annuity\\nFORM 10-K : 61\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\\ncontracts. With respect to the sale of mutual funds, acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the funds obtained. (c) NonCash Transactions: During 2001, AIG issued 291.6 million common shares in connection with acquisitions. (d) Investments in Fixed Maturities and Equity Securities: Bonds held to maturity are principally owned by the insurance subsidiaries and are carried at amortized cost where AIG has the ability and positive intent to hold these securities until maturity. Where AIG may not have the positive intent to hold bonds and preferred stocks until maturity, these securities are considered to be available for sale and carried at current market values. Interest income with respect to fixed maturity securities is accrued currently. Included in the bonds available for sale are collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). Premiums and discounts arising from the purchase of CMOs are treated as yield adjustments over their estimated lives. Bond trading securities are carried at current market values, as it is AIG’s intention to sell these securities in the near term. Common and nonredeemable preferred stocks are carried at current market values. Dividend income is generally recognized when receivable. Unrealized gains and losses from investments in equity securities and fixed maturities available for sale are reflected as a separate component of comprehensive income, net of deferred income taxes in shareholders’ equity currently. Unrealized gains and losses from investments in trading securities are reflected in income currently. Realized capital gains and losses are determined principally by specific identification. Where declines in values of securities below cost or amortized cost are considered to be other than temporary, a charge is reflected in income for the difference between cost or amortized cost and estimated net fair value. AIG regularly reviews its investments for possible impairment based on criteria including economic conditions, market prices, past experience and other issuer-specific developments among other factors. If there is a decline in a security’s net realizable value, a determination is made as towhether that decline is temporary or “other-than temporary”. If it is believed that a decline in the value of a particular investment is temporary, the decline is recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income. If it is believed that the decline is “other-than temporary”, AIG writes down the carrying value of the investment and records a realized loss in the statement of income. In January 2001, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF 99-20, “Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets.” EITF 99-20 provides guidance on the calculation of interest income and the recognition of impairments related to beneficial interests held in an investment portfolio. Beneficial interests are investments that represent rights to receive specified cash flows from a pool of underlying assets (e.g., collateralized debt obligations). In accordance with the transition provisions of EITF 99-20, AIG recorded in its consolidated income statement for 2001 a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment loss of $130 million ($200 million before tax).

(i) Spot Commodities, at market value: Spot commodities are carried at current market values and are recorded on a trade date basis. The exposure to market risk may be reduced through the use of forwards, futures and option contracts. Unrealized gains and losses of both commodities and any derivative transactions are reflected in income currently. (j) Unrealized Gain and Unrealized Loss on Interest Rate and Currency Swaps, Options and Forward Transactions: Interest rate swaps, currency swaps, equity swaps, swaptions, options and forward transactions are accounted for as contractual commitments recorded on a trade date basis and are carried at current market values or estimated fair values when market values are not available. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in income currently. Estimated fair values are based on the use of valuation models that utilize, among other things, current interest, foreign exchange and volatility rates. AIG attempts to secure reliable and independent current market prices, such as published exchange prices, external subscription services’ prices such as Bloomberg or Reuters or third party broker quotes for use in these models. When such prices are not available, AIG uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from observable and verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions. These valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows of these transactions and reflect market and credit risk. The portfolio’s discounted cash flows are evaluated with reference to current market conditions, maturities within the portfolio and other relevant factors. Based upon this evaluation, it is determined what offsetting transactions, if any, are necessary to reduce the market risk of the portfolio. AIG manages its market risk with a variety of transactions, including swaps, trading securities, futures and forward contracts and other transactions as appropriate. Because of the limited liquidity of some of these instruments, the recorded values of these transactions may be different than the values that might be realized if AIG were to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes that such differences are not significant to the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Such differences would be immediately recognized in income when the transactions are sold or closed out prior to maturity. (k) Trading Assets and Trading Liabilities: Trading assets and trading liabilities include option premiums paid and received and receivables from and payables to counterparties which relate to unrealized gains and losses on futures, forwards and options and balances due from and due to clearing brokers and exchanges. Futures, forwards and options purchased and written are accounted for as contractual commitments on a trade date basis and are carried at fair values. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in income currently. The fair values of futures contracts are based on closing exchange quotations. Commodity forward transactions are carried at fair values derived from dealer quotations and underlying commodity exchange quotations. For long dated forward transactions, where there are no dealer or exchange quotations, fair values are derived using internally developed valuation methodologies based on observable and available market information. Options are carried at fair values based on the use of valuation models that utilize, among other things, current interest or commodity rates and foreign exchange and volatility rates, as applicable. (l) Securities Purchased (Sold) Under Agreements to Resell (Repurchase), at contract value: Purchases of securities under agreements to resell and sales of securities under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized lending transactions and are recorded at their contracted resale or repurchase amounts, plus accrued interest. Generally, it is AIG’s policy to take possession of or obtain a security interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell. FORM 10-K : 63\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\\nAIG minimizes the credit risk that counterparties to transactions might be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations by monitoring customer credit exposure and collateral value and generally requiring additional collateral to be deposited with AIG when deemed necessary. AIG also enters into dollar roll agreements. These are agreements to sell mortgage-backed securities and to repurchase substantially the same securities at a specified price and date in the future. At December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, there were no dollar rolls outstanding. (m) Finance Receivables: Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of an allowance. (n) Securities Lending Collateral and Securities Lending Payable: AIG’s insurance operations lend their securities and primarily take cash as collateral with respect to the securities lent. Income earned on invested collateral, net of interest payable to the collateral provider is recorded in net investment income. (o) Other Invested Assets: Other invested assets consist primarily of investments by AIG’s insurance operations in joint ventures and partnerships, and other investments not classified elsewhere herein. The joint ventures and partnerships are carried at equity or cost depending on the equity ownership position. Other investments are carried at cost or market values depending upon the nature of the underlying assets. (p) Reinsurance Assets: Reinsurance assets include the balances due from both reinsurance and insurance companies under the terms of AIG’s reinsurance agreements for paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses, ceded unearned premiums and ceded future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and benefits paid and unpaid. Amounts related to paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses with respect to these reinsurance agreements are substantially collateralized. (q) Investments in Partially Owned Companies: Generally, the equity method of accounting is used for AIG’s investment in companies in which AIG’s ownership interest approximates 20 percent but is not greater than 50 percent (minority owned companies). At December 31, 2003, AIG’s significant investments in partially owned companies included its 24.3 percent interest in IPC Holdings, Ltd., its 23.4 percent interest in Allied World Assurance Holdings, Ltd. and its 22.1 percent interest in The Fuji Fire and Marine Insurance Co., Ltd. This balance sheet caption also includes investments in less significant partially owned companies and in certain minor majority owned subsidiaries. The amounts of dividends received from unconsolidated entities owned less than 50 percent were $13 million, $13 million and $3 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The undistributed earnings of unconsolidated entities owned less than 50 percent was $283 million and $155 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. (r) Real Estate and Other Fixed Assets: The costs of buildings and furniture and equipment are depreciated principally on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (maximum of 40 years for buildings and 10 years for furniture and equipment). Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred; expenditures for betterments are capitalized and depreciated. From time to time, AIG assesses the carrying value of its real estate relative to the market values of real estate within the specific local area. (s) Separate and Variable Accounts: Separate and variable accounts represent funds for which investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to the policyholders who predominantly bear the investment risk. Each account has specific investment objectives, and the assets are carried at market value. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims which arise out of any other business of AIG. The liabilities for these accounts are equal to the account assets. (t) Securities and Spot Commodities Sold but not yet Purchased, at market value: Securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased represent sales of securities and spot commodities not owned at the time of sale. The obligations arising from such transactions are recorded on a trade date basis and carried at the respective current market values or current commodity prices.'),\n",

Functional currencies are generally the currencies of the local operating environment. Income statement accounts expressed in functional currencies are translated using average exchange rates. The adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign entities operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in income. Exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are also recorded in income currently. The exchange gain or loss with respect to utilization of foreign exchange hedging instruments is recorded as a component of comprehensive income. (x) Income Taxes: Deferred federal and foreign income taxes are provided for temporary differences for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in AIG’s financial statements or tax returns. (y) Earnings Per Share: Basic earnings per common share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, retroactively adjusted to reflect all stock dividends and stock splits. Diluted earnings per share are based on those shares used in basic earnings per share plus shares that would have been outstanding assuming issuance of common shares for all dilutive potential common shares outstanding, retroactively adjusted to reflect all stock dividends and stock splits. The computation of earnings per share for December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was as follows:\\n*\\nCertain shares arising from employee stock plans were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share where the exercise price of the options exceeded the average market price and would have been antidilutive. The number of shares excluded were 26 million, 9 million and 3 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. (z) Derivatives: In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FAS 133. In June 2000, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133.” In April 2003, FASB issued Statement of Financial Standards No. 149 “An Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” (collectively, FAS 133). FAS 133 requires AIG to recognize all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The financial statement recognition of the change in the fair value of a derivative depends on a number of factors, including the intended use of the derivative and the extent to which it is effective as part of a hedge transaction. The changes in fair value of the derivative transactions of AIGFP and AIG Trading Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (AIGTG) are currently presented, in all material respects, as a component of AIG’s operating income. The discussion below relates to the derivative activities of AIG other than those of AIGFP and AIGTG. FORM 10-K : 65\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\\nOn the date the derivative contract is entered into, AIG designates the derivative as: (i) a hedge of the subsequent changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (“fair value” hedge); (ii) a hedge of a forecasted transaction, or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow” hedge); or (iii) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Fair value and cash flow hedges may involve foreign currencies (“foreign currency hedges”). The gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative that is designated, qualifies and is highly effective as a fair value hedge is recorded in current period earnings, along with the loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative that is designated, qualifies and is highly effective as a cash flow hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows. The gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative that is designated, qualifies and is highly effective as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustments account within other comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of derivatives used for other than the above hedging activities are reported in current period earnings. AIG documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet, or specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. AIG also assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. In accordance with the transition provisions of FAS 133, AIG recorded in its consolidated income statement for 2001 a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment loss of $6 million. This loss represents the net fair value of all previous unrecorded derivative instruments as of January 1, 2001, net of tax and after the application of hedge accounting. AIG also recorded in its consolidated statement of comprehensive income for 2001 a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment gain of $150 million. This gain represents the increase in other comprehensive income, net of taxes, arising from recognizing the fair value of all derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments, and to a lesser extent, hedging instruments used to hedge net investments in foreign operations. In addition to hedging activities, AIG also uses derivative instruments with respect to investment operations, which include, among other things, writing option contracts, and purchasing investments with embedded derivatives, such as equity linked notes and convertible bonds. All changes in the market value of these derivatives are recorded in earnings. AIG bifurcates an embedded derivative where: (i) the economic characteristics of the embedded instruments are not clearly and closely related to those of the remaining components of the financial instrument; and (ii) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument meets the definition of a derivative under FAS 133.

FAS 141 requires AIG, among other things, to apply the purchase method of accounting for all acquisitions initiated after June 30, 2001. In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (FAS 142). As of January 1, 2002, AIG adopted FAS 142. FAS 142 requires AIG to discontinue the amortization of goodwill in its consolidated income statement. Amortization expense recorded in AIG’s consolidated statement of income amounted to $163 million pretax for 2001. FAS 142 requires goodwill to be subject to an assessment of impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that a possible impairment has occurred. The assessment of impairment involves a two-step process prescribed in FAS 142, whereby an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed, followed by a measurement of the amount of impairment, if any. FAS 142 also requires the completion of a transitional impairment test in the year of adoption, with any identified impairments recognized as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principles. AIG completed its transitional impairment test for 2002 and its annual test for 2003, resulting in no impairment. On August 29, 2003, AIG acquired 100 percent of the outstanding common shares of GE Edison Life Insurance Company in Japan and GE’s U.S. based auto and home insurance business for $2.1 billion. The acquisition expands AIG’s life insurance presence in Japan and AIG’s auto and home insurance presence in the U.S. At the date of acquisition, the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were $20 billion and $19 billion, respectively. Goodwill associated with this transaction as of December 31, 2003 amounted to $1.3 billion, primarily related to the life business. Other changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are primarily caused as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments. FORM 10-K : 66\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\\n(bb) Accounting Standards: In November 2002, FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (FIN 45). FIN 45 requires that, for guarantees within its scope that are issued or amended after December 31, 2002, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee be established and recognized through earnings. To date, the impact on earnings for AIG has not been and is not expected to be material. AIG guarantees the indebtedness of third parties principally in connection with AIG SunAmerica’s investments in affordable housing properties. The guarantees are issued primarily to facilitate financing for the construction of the underlying properties, and have durations of up to ten years. Since the inception of this investment program over ten years ago, payments under these guarantees have been insignificant because the loans are first backed by the creditworthiness of the third party general partner, and secondly, are secured by the underlying properties. The maximum exposure before consideration of the applicable security under these guarantees as of December 31, 2003 is approximately $2.4 billion. In addition, AIG’s real estate investment operations will occasionally extend guarantees to real estate partnerships in which they are an investor. The guarantees facilitate financing for the construction and/or purchase of land. There have been no payments to date under these guarantees as the loans are first backed by the creditworthiness of the third party general partner, and secondly, are secured by the underlying properties. The maximum exposure before consideration of the applicable security of these guarantees as of December 31, 2003 is approximately $112 million. Through ILFC, AIG has also provided other types of guarantees. From time to time, ILFC participates with airlines, banks and other financial institutions to assist in financing aircraft by providing asset guarantees, put options or loan guarantees. Historically, losses arising from these guarantees have not been material, as ILFC has recourse to the value of the underlying aircraft, which offsets ILFC’s exposure, should ILFC be called upon to fulfill its obligations under these guarantees. The maximum exposure related to these guarantees as of December 31, 2003, before consideration of the applicable security, is approximately $897 million. In January 2003, FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (FIN46). (See also Note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.)\\nIn May 2003, FASB issued Financial Accounting Standard No. 150 “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity” (FAS 150). FAS 150 requires certain financial instruments previously classified as either entirely equity or between the liabilities section and the equity section of the balance sheet to be classified as liabilities. FAS 150 requires issuers to classify as liabilities the following three types of freestanding financial instruments: mandatory redeemable financial instruments; obligations to repurchase the issuer’s equity shares by transferring assets; and certain obligations to issue a variable number of shares. FAS 150 was effective for the quarter ending September 30, 2003. As of December 31, 2003, $1.68 billion of preferred instruments previously classified on AIG’s consolidated balance sheet as “Preferred shareholders’ equity in subsidiary companies” is now classified in the liability caption entitled “Preferred shareholders’ equity in subsidiary companies subject to mandatory redemption.” Restatement of financial statements for prior periods is not permitted. In July 2003, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position 03-1, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts” (SOP 03-1). FASB did not object to the issuance of SOP 03-1. This statement is effective as of January 1, 2004, and will require AIG to recognize a liability for guaranteed minimum death benefits and other living benefits related to its variable annuity and variable life contracts and to modify certain disclosures and financial statement presentations for these products. In the first quarter of 2004, AIG will report a one-time cumulative accounting charge upon adoption of $181 million ($278 million pretax to reflect the liability as of January 1, 2004). With respect to the balance sheet presentation, the non-U.S. portion of AIG’s separate and variable account assets and liabilities will be reclassified to several invested asset captions and the policyholders’ contract deposits liability caption, respectively. In December 2003, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132 (Revised) “Employers’ Disclosures About Pensions and Other Post Retirement Benefits” which revised disclosure requirements with respect to defined benefit plans.

Segment Information\\nDuring the three years ended December 31, 2003, AIG’s operations were conducted principally through four business segments. These segments and their respective operations are as follows:\\nGeneral Insurance: AIG’s General Insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance. AIG’s principal General Insurance operations are as follows:\\nDBG writes substantially all classes of business insurance accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers. Transatlantic offers through its reinsurance company subsidiaries reinsurance capacity both domestically and overseas on treaty and facultative bases for a full range of property and casualty products. Personal Lines engages in the mass marketing of personal lines insurance, primarily private passenger auto and personal umbrella coverages. Mortgage Guaranty provides guaranty insurance primarily on conventional first mortgage loans on single family dwellings and condominiums. AIG’s Foreign General insurance group accepts risks primarily underwritten through AIU, a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned agencies and insurance entities. The Foreign General insurance group also includes business written by AIG’s foreign-based insurance subsidiaries for their own accounts. The Foreign General group uses various marketing methods to write both business and personal lines insurance with certain refinements for local laws, customs and needs. AIU operates in Asia, the Pacific Rim, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America. Life Insurance: AIG’s Life Insurance subsidiaries offer a wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment products. Traditional products consist of individual and group life, annuity, endowment and accident and health policies.

Federal Income Taxes\\n(a) AIG and its eligible domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return. Each of the AGC group of life insurance companies and the AIG SunAmerica group of life insurance companies also file a consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return. Commencing with taxable year 2004, the AIG SunAmerica group of life insurance companies will be included in AIG’s consolidated tax return. Revenue Agent’s Reports proposing to assess additional taxes for the years 1991-1996 and 1997-1999 have been issued to AIG. Letters of Protest contesting the proposed assessments for 1991-1996 have been filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). A Letter of Protest is also being filed for 1997-1999. AIG has also filed a petition with the Tax Court for tax year 1990 regarding a transitional rule in the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, Revenue Agent’s Reports proposing to assess additional taxes for the years ended September 30, 1993-1994 and 1995-1996 have been issued to AIG SunAmerica. Such proposed assessments relate to years prior to AIG’s acquisition of SunAmerica, Inc. Letters of Protest contesting the proposed assessments have been filed with the IRS. It is management’s belief that there are substantial arguments in support of the positions taken by AIG and AIG SunAmerica in their Letters of Protest and in AIG’s petition to the Tax Court. Although the final outcome of any issues raised in connection with these examinations or the litigation is uncertain, AIG believes that the tax obligation, including interest thereon, will not be significant to AIG’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. AGC’s tax years through 1999 have been audited and settled with the IRS. A component of life insurance surplus accumulated prior to 1984 is not taxable unless it exceeds certain statutory limitations or is distributed to shareholders. This surplus, accumulated in policyholder surplus accounts, totaled approximately $945 million at December 31, 2003. AIG has not made any provision in the accompanying financial statements for taxation of this amount as management has no intention of making any distributions from this surplus. Foreign income not expected to be taxed in the United States has arisen because AIG’s foreign subsidiaries were generally not subject to U.S. income taxes on income earned prior to January 1, 1987.'),\n",

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs\\nThe following reflects the policy acquisition costs deferred for amortization against future income and the related amortization charged to income for general and life insurance operations, excluding certain amounts deferred and amortized in the same period:\\n5. Reinsurance\\nIn the ordinary course of business, AIG’s general and life insurance companies cede reinsurance to other insurance companies in order to provide greater diversification of AIG’s business and limit the potential for losses arising from large risks. General reinsurance is effected under reinsurance treaties and by negotiation on individual risks. Certain of these reinsurance arrangements consist of excess of loss contracts which protect AIG against losses over stipulated amounts. Ceded premiums are considered prepaid reinsurance premiums and are amortized into income over the contract period in proportion to the protection received. Amounts recoverable from general reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claims liabilities associated with the reinsurance and presented as a component of reinsurance assets. AIG life companies limit exposure to loss on any single life. For ordinary insurance, AIG retains a maximum of approximately $1.5 million of coverage per individual life with respect to AIG’s overseas life operations and $2.5 million of coverage per individual life with respect to AIG’s domestic life operations. There are smaller retentions for other lines of business. Life reinsurance is effected principally under yearly renewable term treaties. The premiums with respect to these treaties are considered prepaid reinsurance premiums and are amortized into income over the contract period in proportion to the protection provided. Amounts recoverable from life reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the assumptions used for the underlying policy benefits and are presented as a component of reinsurance assets. General Insurance premiums written and earned were comprised of the following:\\nFor the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, reinsurance recoveries, which reduced loss and loss expenses incurred, amounted to $10.43 billion, $10.28 billion and $8.80 billion, respectively. GAAP Life premiums were comprised of the following:\\nLife Insurance recoveries, which reduced death and other benefits, approximated $651 million, $624 million and $646 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. AIG’s reinsurance arrangements do not relieve AIG from its direct obligation to its insureds. Thus, a credit exposure exists with respect to both general and life reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations assumed under the reinsurance agreements. AIG holds substantial collateral as security under related reinsurance agreements in the form of funds, securities and/or letters of credit. A provision has been recorded for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance. AIG has been largely successful in prior recovery efforts. AIG evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers through an internal reinsurance security committee consisting of members of AIG’s senior management. No single reinsurer is a material reinsurer to AIG nor is AIG’s business substantially dependent upon any reinsurance contract. FORM 10-K : 76\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n5. Reinsurance (continued)\\nLife Insurance ceded to other insurance companies was as follows:\\nLife Insurance assumed represented 0.1 percent, 0.2 percent and 0.2 percent of gross Life Insurance in-force at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 and GAAP Life premiums assumed represented 0.2 percent, 0.2 percent and 0.3 percent of gross GAAP premiums for the periods ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

(iii) The portions of current and prior net income and of current unrealized appreciation of investments that can inure to the benefit of AIG are restricted in some cases by the insurance contracts and by the local insurance regulations of the countries in which the policies are in force. (iv) Participating life business represented approximately 28 percent of the gross insurance in-force at December 31, 2003 and 38 percent of gross GAAP premiums in 2003. The amount of annual dividends to be paid is determined locally by the Boards of Directors. Provisions for future dividend payments are computed by jurisdiction, reflecting local regulations. (d) The liability for policyholders’ contract deposits has been established based on the following assumptions:\\n(i) Interest rates credited on deferred annuities, which vary by territory and year of issuance, range from 1.5 percent to 9.0 percent. Current declared interest rates are generally guaranteed to remain in effect for a period of one year though some are guaranteed for longer periods. Withdrawal charges generally range from zero percent to 16.0 percent grading to zero over a period of zero to 15 years. (ii) Domestically, GICs have market value withdrawal provisions for any funds withdrawn other than benefit responsive payments. Interest rates credited generally range from 1.2 percent to 9.0 percent. The vast majority of these GICs mature within 10 years. Overseas, interest rates credited on GICs generally range from 1.5 percent to 6.9 percent and maturities range from one to five years. (iii) Interest rates on corporate life insurance products are guaranteed at 4.0 percent and the weighted average rate credited in 2003 was 5.8 percent. (iv) The universal life funds have credited interest rates of 3.1 percent to 7.5 percent and guarantees ranging from 3.0 percent to 5.5 percent depending on the year of issue. Additionally, universal life funds are subject to surrender charges that amount to 11.0 percent of the aggregate fund balance grading to zero over a period not longer than 20 years. (e) Certain products, which are short duration contracts, are subject to experience adjustments. These include group life and group medical products, credit life contracts, accident and health insurance contracts/riders attached to life policies and, to a limited extent, reinsurance agreements with other direct insurers. Ultimate premiums from these contracts are estimated and recognized as revenue and the unearned portions of the premiums are held as reserves. Experience adjustments vary according to the type of contract and the territory in which the policy is in force and are subject to local regulatory guidance. 7. Statutory Financial Data\\nStatutory surplus and net income for general insurance and life insurance operations as reported to regulatory authorities were as follows:\\n(a)\\nIncludes loss reserve charge, net of tax of $1.8 billion. (b)\\nIncludes net realized capital gains and losses. AIG’s insurance subsidiaries file financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by domestic or foreign insurance regulatory authorities. The differences between statutory financial statements and financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP vary between domestic and foreign jurisdictions. The principal differences are that statutory financial statements do not reflect deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred income taxes, all bonds are carried at amortized cost and assets and liabilities are presented net of reinsurance. AIG’s use of permitted statutory accounting practices does not have a significant impact on statutory surplus. FORM 10-K : 78\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n8. Investment Information\\n(a) Statutory Deposits: Cash and securities with carrying values of $7.46 billion and $5.20 billion were deposited by AIG’s insurance subsidiaries under requirements of regulatory authorities as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

(e) CMOs: At December 31, 2003, CMOs, held by AIG’s life companies, were presented as a component of bonds available for sale, at market value. Substantially all of the CMOs were investment grade and approximately 23 percent of the CMOs were backed by various U.S. government agencies. The remaining 77 percent were corporate issuances. The distribution of the CMOs at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was as follows:\\nAIG is not exposed to any significant credit concentration risk of a single or group nongovernmental issuer. At December 31, 2003, the gross weighted average coupon of this portfolio was 5.73 percent. The gross weighted average life of this portfolio was approximately 6.14 years. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the market value of the CMO portfolio was $38.99 billion and $35.61 billion, respectively; the amortized cost was approximately $38.10 billion in 2003 and $34.30 billion in 2002. AIG’s CMO portfolio is readily marketable. There were no derivative (high risk) CMO securities contained in this portfolio at December 31, 2003 and 2002.

(iii) Medium Term Notes Payable Issued by AIG: AIG’s Medium Term Notes are unsecured obligations which generally may not be redeemed by AIG prior to maturity and bear interest at either fixed rates set by AIG at issuance or variable rates determined by reference to an interest rate or other formula. An analysis of AIG’s Medium Term Notes for the year ended December 31, 2003 was as follows:\\nThe interest rates on AIG’s Medium Term Notes range from 0.50 percent to 3.25 percent. To the extent deemed appropriate, AIG may enter into swap transactions to reduce its effective borrowing rates with respect to these notes. At December 31, 2003, Medium Term Notes originally issued by SunAmerica, Inc. (SAI), which was merged into AIG on January 1, 1999, aggregating $122 million had maturity dates ranging from 2004 to 2026 at interest rates ranging from 6.43 percent to 7.34 percent. During 2000, AIG issued $210 million of equity-linked Medium Term Notes due May 15, 2007. These notes accrue interest at the rate of 0.50 percent and the total return on these notes is linked to the appreciation in market value of AIG’s common stock. The notes may be redeemed, at the option of AIG, as a whole but not in part, at any time on or after May 15, 2003. In conjunction with the issuance of these notes, AIG entered into a series of swap transactions which effectively converted its interest expense to a fixed rate of 7.17 percent until May 15, 2003 and 0.50 percent thereafter and transferred the equity appreciation exposure to a third party for the life of the notes. AIG is exposed to credit risk with respect to the counterparties to these swap transactions. During 2003, $45 million of these notes were redeemed.

ILFC had $11.08 billion of debt securities registered for public sale at December 31, 2003. During 2003, $6.09 billion of debt securities were issued. During the second quarter of 2003, ILFC increased its Euro Medium Term Note Program from $4.0 billion to $5.0 billion, under which $3.39 billion in notes were sold through December 31, 2003. ILFC has substantially eliminated the currency exposure arising from foreign-currency-denominated notes by either hedging the notes through swaps, or through the offset provided by operating lease payments. ILFC translates the debt into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. The foreign exchange adjustment for the foreign-currency-denominated notes was $697 million at December 31, 2003. Notes issued under this program are included in Notes and Bonds Payable in the accompanying table of borrowings. ILFC had a $4.3 billion Export Credit Facility for use in connection with the purchase of approximately 75 aircraft delivered through 2001. This facility was guaranteed by various European Export Credit Agencies. The interest rate varies from 5.75 percent to 5.90 percent on these borrowings depending on the delivery date of the aircraft. At December 31, 2003, ILFC had $1.8 billion outstanding under this facility. The debt is collateralized by a pledge of the shares of a subsidiary of ILFC, which holds title to the aircraft financed under the facility. Borrowings with respect to this facility are included in Notes and Bonds Payable. During 2003, ILFC entered into various bank financings for a total funded amount of $1.3 billion. The financings mature through 2009. One tranche of one of the loans totaling $410 million was funded in Japanese yen and swapped to US dollars. The interest rates are LIBOR based and ranged from 0.375 percent to 1.625 percent at December 31, 2003. AIG does not guarantee any of the debt obligations of ILFC. (iii) Notes and Bonds Payable Issued by AGF: As of December 31, 2003, AGF notes aggregating $1.74 billion were outstanding with maturity dates ranging from 2004 to 2010 at interest rates ranging from 1.26 percent to 8.45 percent. These notes provide for a single principal payment at maturity. In 2003, AGF increased its shelf registration statement by $7.5 billion. AGF had $9.1 billion of debt securities registered and available for issuance at December 31, 2003. AGF uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes and bonds for the funding of its finance receivables. AIG does not guarantee any of the debt obligations of AGF. (iv) Notes, Bonds and Debentures Issued by AIG:\\n(A) Zero Coupon Notes: On October 1, 1984, AIG issued Eurodollar zero coupon notes in the aggregate principal amount at stated maturity of $750 million. The notes were offered at 12 percent of principal amount at stated maturity, bear no interest and are due August 15, 2004. The net proceeds to AIG from the issuance were $86 million. The notes are redeemable at any time in whole or in part at the option of AIG at 100 percent of their principal amount at stated maturity. The notes are also redeemable at the option of AIG or bearer notes may be redeemed at the option of the holder in the event of certain changes involving taxation in the United States at a price of 89.88 percent after August 15, 2003, of the principal amount at stated maturity together with accrued amortization of original issue discount from the preceding August 15. During 2003 and 2002, no notes were repurchased. At December 31, 2003, the notes outstanding after prior purchases had a face value of $189 million, an unamortized discount of $12 million and a net book value of $177 million. The amortization of the original issue discount was recorded as interest expense. (B) Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Debentures: On November 9, 2001, AIG issued zero coupon convertible senior debentures in the aggregate principal amount at stated maturity of $1.52 billion. The notes were offered at 65.8 percent of principal amount at stated maturity, bear no interest unless contingent interest becomes payable under certain conditions and are due November 9, 2031. The net proceeds to AIG were $990 million. Commencing January 1, 2002, holders may convert the debentures into shares of AIG common stock at a conversion rate of 6.0627 shares per $1,000 principal amount of debentures on any day if AIG’s common stock price exceeds 120 percent of the conversion price on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter for a set period of time, and after September 30, 2031, on any day if AIG’s common stock price exceeds such amount for one day, subject to certain restrictions. The debentures are redeemable by AIG on or after November 9, 2006 at specified redemption prices. Holders may require AIG to repurchase the debentures at specified repurchase prices on November 9, 2006, 2011, 2016, 2021 and 2026. At December 31, 2003, the debentures outstanding had a face value of $1.52 billion, unamortized discount of $489 million and a net book value of $1.03 billion. The amortization of the original issue discount was recorded as a component of other income (deductions) - net. (C) Notes and Debentures Issued by SAI: As of December 31, 2003, notes and debentures originally issued by SAI aggregating $434 million (net of amortized discount of $41 million) were outstanding with maturity dates from 2007 to 2097 at interest rates ranging from 5.60 percent to 9.95 percent.

Debt Outstanding (continued)\\n(D) Term Notes: On May 15, 2003, AIG sold $1.5 billion principal amount of notes in a Rule 144A/Regulation S offering, $500 million of which bear interest at a rate of 2.875 percent per annum and mature in 2008 and $1.0 billion of which bear interest at a rate of 4.250 percent per annum and mature in 2013. The notes are senior unsecured obligations of AIG and rank equally with all of AIG’s other senior debt outstanding. (v) Notes and Bonds Payable Issued by AGC: As of December 31, 2003, AGC notes aggregating $1.24 billion were outstanding with maturity dates ranging from 2004 to 2029 at interest rates ranging up to 7.75 percent. As of November 2001, AIG guaranteed the notes and bonds of AGC. During 2002, AGC issued $200 million in notes which matured in March 2003. (e) Loans and Mortgages Payable: Loans and mortgages payable at December 31, 2003, consisted of the following:\\nAt December 31, 2003, ILFC’s capital lease obligations were $143 million. Fixed interest rates with respect to these obligations range from 6.18 percent to 6.89 percent; variable rates are referenced to LIBOR. These obligations mature through 2005. The flight equipment associated with the capital lease obligations had a net book value of $824 million. At December 31, 2003, the maturity schedule for ILFC’s capital lease obligations was as follows:\\n(f) Revolving Credit Facilities: AIG and Funding are parties to unsecured syndicated revolving credit facilities (collectively, the Facility) aggregating $2.75 billion. The Facility consists of $1.375 billion in a short-term revolving credit facility and $1.375 billion in a five year revolving credit facility. The Facility can be used for general corporate purposes and also to provide backup for AIG’s commercial paper programs administered by Funding. There are currently no borrowings outstanding under the Facility, nor were any borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2003. AGF is a party to unsecured syndicated revolving credit facilities aggregating $3.0 billion. The facilities consist of $1.5 billion in a short-term revolving credit facility and $1.5 billion in a five year revolving credit facility, which support AGF’s commercial paper borrowings. There are currently no borrowings under these facilities, nor were any borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2003. ILFC is a party to unsecured syndicated revolving credit facilities aggregating $4.2 billion at December 31, 2003. The facilities are used to support ILFC’s maturing debt and other obligations and consist of $3.15 billion in a short-term revolving credit facility and $1.05 billion in a three year revolving credit facility. There are currently no borrowings under these facilities, nor were any borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2003. (g) Interest Expense for All Indebtedness: Total interest expense for all indebtedness, net of capitalized interest, aggregated $4.08 billion in 2003, $3.57 billion in 2002 and $3.97 billion in 2001. Capitalized interest was $52 million in 2003, $61 million in 2002 and $71 million in 2001. Cash distributions on the preferred shareholders’ equity in subsidiary companies of ILFC and certain AIG SunAmerica, AGC and HSB subsidiaries are accounted for as interest expense in the consolidated statement of income. The cash distributions for ILFC were approximately $4 million, $5 million and $15 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The cash distributions for the AIG SunAmerica subsidiaries were approximately $1 million, $8 million and $46 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The cash distributions for AGC subsidiaries were approximately $128 million, $129 million and $153 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 10. Preferred Shareholders’ Equity in Subsidiary Companies\\nAt December 31, 2002, Preferred shareholders’ equity in subsidiary companies included preferred stocks and interests issued by subsidiaries of AGC, HSB, ILFC and AIG SunAmerica. The AIG SunAmerica preferred stock, which was redeemed in March 2003, consisted of $350 million liquidation amount of Non-Voting Preferred Interests issued by its subsidiary, Total Return LLC. At September 30, 2003, AIG implemented the provisions of FASB 150. As a result, certain preferred instruments previously classified on AIG’s consolidated balance sheet as “Preferred shareholders’ equity in subsidiary companies” is now\\nFORM 10-K : 86\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n10. Preferred Shareholders’ Equity in Subsidiary Companies (continued)\\nclassified in the liability caption entitled “Preferred shareholders’ equity in subsidiary companies subject to mandatory redemption.” (See also Note 1 herein.)\\n(a) Preferred Shareholders’ Equity in Subsidiary Companies Subject to Mandatory Redemption: At December 31, 2003, Preferred shareholders’ equity in subsidiary companies subject to mandatory redemption represent preferred stocks issued by certain AGC and HSB subsidiaries. (i) AGC: The preferred stock has been issued by five subsidiary trusts (the subsidiaries). The sole assets of these subsidiaries are Junior Subordinated Debentures (Subordinated Debentures) issued by AGC. These subsidiaries have no independent operations. The Subordinated Debentures are eliminated in consolidation. The interest terms and payment dates of the Subordinated Debentures held by the subsidiaries correspond to those of the subsidiaries’ preferred securities. AGC’s obligations under the Subordinated Debentures and related agreements, when taken together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by AGC of payments due on the preferred securities. The Subordinated Debentures are redeemable, under certain conditions, at the option of AGC on a proportionate basis. The preferred stock consists of $100 million liquidation value of 8.05 percent preferred stock issued by American General Capital III in December 2000, $300 million liquidation value of 8.5 percent preferred stock issued by American General Capital II in June 2000, $200 million liquidation value of 7.875 percent preferred stock issued by American General Capital I in September 1999, $500 million liquidation value of 8.125 percent preferred stock issued by American General Institutional Capital B in March 1997, and $500 million liquidation value of 7.57 percent preferred stock issued by American General Institutional Capital A in December 1996. (ii) HSB: The preferred stock consists of $95 million liquidation value of Exchange Capital Securities issued in July 1997 by HSB Capital I, a statutory business trust wholly owned by HSB. The sole assets of HSB Capital I are invested in debt securities of HSB. The capital securities accrue and pay quarterly cash distributions at a variable rate equal to 90 day LIBOR plus 0.91 percent of the stated liquidation amount of $1,000 per capital security, which rate was 2.06 percent at December 31, 2003. The capital securities are not redeemable prior to July 15, 2007 and are mandatorily redeemable upon the maturity of the debt securities on July 15, 2027 or the earlier redemption of the debt securities. AIG has issued a guarantee of the obligations of HSB, which together with the terms of the debt securities, the guarantee of\\nHSB with respect to the capital securities, the indenture and the trust agreement with respect to the trust provide a full and unconditional guarantee of payments due on the capital securities. The trust is accounted for as a wholly owned subsidiary of AIG. The debt securities issued to the trust and the common securities issued by the trust to HSB are eliminated in the consolidated balance sheet. (b) Preferred shareholders’ equity in subsidiary companies: As of December 31, 2003, Preferred shareholders’ equity in subsidiary companies represents preferred stocks issued by ILFC and AIG Edison Life, wholly owned subsidiaries of AIG. At December 31, 2003, the preferred stock consists of 1,000 shares of market auction preferred stock (“MAPS”) in two series (Series A and B) of 500 shares each. Each of the MAPS shares has a liquidation value of $100,000 per share and is not convertible. The dividend rate, other than the initial rate, for each dividend period for each series is reset approximately every seven weeks (49 days) on the basis of orders placed in an auction. ILFC repurchased all of the shares of five additional series for their liquidation value in the fourth quarter of 2001 and a sixth in the first six months of 2002. No gains or losses were recognized. During 2001, ILFC extended the term of the Series A to five years at a dividend rate of 5.90 percent. At December 31, 2003, the dividend rate for Series B was 1.54 percent. 11. Shareholders’ Equity\\n(a) AIG parent depends on its subsidiaries for cash flow in the form of loans, advances and dividends. AIG’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions on the amount of dividends which can be remitted to AIG parent. These restrictions vary by state. For example, unless permitted by the New York Superintendent of Insurance, general insurance companies domiciled in New York may not pay dividends to shareholders which in any twelve month period exceed the lesser of 10 percent of the company’s statutory policyholders’ surplus or 100 percent of its “adjusted net investment income”, as defined. Generally, less severe restrictions applicable to both General and Life Insurance companies exist in most of the other states in which AIG’s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled. Certain foreign jurisdictions have restrictions which generally cause only a temporary delay in the remittance of dividends. There are also various local restrictions limiting cash loans and advances to AIG by its subsidiaries. Largely as a result of the restrictions, approximately 71 percent of consolidated shareholders’ equity was restricted from immediate transfer to AIG parent at December 31, 2003. (b) At December 31, 2003, there were 6,000,000 shares of AIG’s $5 par value serial preferred stock authorized, issuable in series, none of which were outstanding.

In addition, AIG guarantees various obligations of certain subsidiaries. (a) AIG and certain of its subsidiaries become parties to derivative financial instruments with market risk resulting from both dealer and end user activities and to reduce currency, interest rate, equity and commodity exposures. These instruments are carried at their estimated fair values in the consolidated balance sheet. The vast majority of AIG’s derivative activity is transacted by Capital Markets. (See also Note 21 herein.)\\n(b) Securities sold, but not yet purchased and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased represent obligations of Capital Markets operations to deliver specified securities and spot commodities at their contracted prices, and thereby record a liability to repurchase the securities and spot commodities in the market at prevailing prices. AIG has issued unconditional guarantees with respect to the prompt payment, when due, of all present and future payment obligations and liabilities of AIGFP and AIGTG arising from transactions entered into by AIGFP and AIGTG. Net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 from Capital Markets operations were $1.85 billion, $1.54 billion and $1.35 billion, respectively. (c) At December 31, 2003, ILFC had committed to purchase 463 new and used aircraft deliverable from 2004 through 2010 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $26.2 billion and had options to purchase 11 new aircraft deliverable from 2004 through 2008 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $705 million. ILFC will be required to find customers for any aircraft acquired, and it must arrange financing for portions of the purchase price of such equipment. (d) AIG and its subsidiaries, in common with the insurance industry in general, are subject to litigation, including claims for punitive damages, in the normal course of their business. AIG does not believe that such litigation will have a material effect on its operating results and financial condition. However, the recent trend of increasing jury awards and settlements makes it somewhat more difficult to assess the ultimate outcome of such litigation. AIG continues to receive claims asserting injuries from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites (hereinafter collectively referred to as environmental claims) and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a difficult process, as these claims, which emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years, cannot be estimated by conventional reserving techniques. Asbestos and environmental claims development is affected by factors such as inconsistent court resolutions, the broadening of the intent of policies and scope of coverage and increasing number of new claims. AIG, together with other industry members, has and will continue to litigate the broadening judicial interpretation of policy coverage and the liability issues. If the courts continue in the future to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage, as they have in the past, additional liabilities would emerge for amounts in excess of reserves held. This emergence cannot now be reasonably estimated, but could have a material impact on AIG’s future operating results. The reserves carried for these claims as at December 31, 2003 ($2.02 billion gross; $669 million net) are believed to be adequate as these reserves are based on known facts and current law.

In the measurement of the fair value of certain financial instruments, where quoted market prices are not available, other valuation techniques are utilized. These fair value estimates are derived using internally developed valuation methodologies based on available and observable market information. FAS 107 excludes certain financial instruments, including those related to insurance contracts. The following methods and assumptions were used by AIG in estimating the fair value of the financial instruments presented:\\nCash and short-term investments: The carrying amounts approximate fair values. Fixed maturity securities: Fair values were generally based upon quoted market prices. For certain fixed maturity securities for which market prices were not readily available, fair values were estimated using values obtained from independent pricing services. No other fair valuation techniques were applied to these securities as AIG believes it would have to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived. Equity securities: Fair values were based upon quoted market prices. Mortgage loans on real estate, policy and collateral loans: Where practical, the fair values of loans on real estate and collateral loans were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based upon AIG’s current incremental lending rates for similar type loans. The fair values of the policy loans were not calculated as AIG believes it would have to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived. Trading assets and trading liabilities: Fair values approximate the carrying values. Finance receivables: Fair values were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based upon the weighted average rates currently being offered for similar finance receivables. Securities available for sale: Fair values were based on quoted market prices. For securities and related hedges for which market prices were not readily available, fair values were estimated using quoted market prices of comparable investments. Securities lending collateral and securities lending payable: The contract values of these financial instruments approximate fair value. Trading securities: Fair values were based on current market value where available. For securities for which market values were not readily available, fair values were estimated using quoted market prices of comparable investments. Spot commodities: Fair values were based on current market prices. Unrealized gains and losses on interest rate and currency swaps, options and forward transactions: Fair values were based on the use of valuation models that utilize, among other things, current interest, foreign exchange and volatility rates, as applicable. Securities purchased (sold) under agreements to resell (repurchase), at contract value: As these securities (obligations) are short-term in nature, the contract values approximate fair values. Other invested assets: For assets for which market prices were not readily available, fair valuation techniques were not applied as AIG believes it would have to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived. Policyholders’ contract deposits: Fair values were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based upon interest rates currently being offered for similar contracts with maturities consistent with those remaining for the contracts being valued. GIAs: Fair values of AIG’s obligations under investment type agreements were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based on interest rates currently being offered for similar agreements with maturities consistent with those remaining for the agreements being valued. Securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased: The carrying amounts for the financial instruments approximate fair values. Fair values for spot commodities sold short were based on current market prices. Trust deposits and deposits due to banks and other depositors: To the extent certain amounts are not demand deposits or certificates of deposit which mature in more than one year, fair values were not calculated as AIG believes it would have to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived.

Notes, bonds, loans and mortgages: Where practical, the fair values of these obligations were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based upon AIG’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowings with maturities consistent with those remaining for the debt being valued. The carrying values and fair values of AIG’s financial instruments at December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the average fair values with respect to derivative positions during 2003 and 2002 were as follows:\\n14. Stock Compensation Plans\\nAt December 31, 2003, AIG had three types of stock-based compensation plans: (i) a stock option plan; (ii) an incentive stock plan under which restricted stock units had been issued; and (iii) an employee stock purchase plan. Effective January 1, 2003, AIG adopted the recognition provision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (FAS 123). This statement establishes the financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based employee compensation plans, such as AIG’s stock purchase plan, stock option plan and stock incentive plan. Under the recognition provisions of FAS 123, costs with respect to stock compensation are measured using the fair value of the shares subscribed or granted as at the date of grant recognized ratably over the vesting period. Such fair value is derived through an option pricing model. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure, an amendment to FASB Statement No. 123” (FAS 148) was issued in 2002. This statement amended FAS 123 and provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the recognition provisions of FAS 123. Also, FAS 148 amended certain of the disclosure requirements of FAS 123. FORM 10-K : 90\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n14. Stock Compensation Plans (continued)\\nAIG has elected the “Prospective Method” in the application of the recognition provisions as prescribed by FAS 123. Such method provides for the recognition of the fair value with respect to stock-based compensation for shares subscribed for or granted on or after January 1, 2003. Prior to adoption of the recognition provisions of FAS 123, as amended, AIG recognized stock compensation in accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”.

With respect to net income for December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the following table provides a pro forma reconciliation as if AIG had adopted the recognition provisions of FAS 123 at its inception:\\nAt December 31, 2002, AIG changed its option-pricing model from the Black-Scholes model to a binomial model (AIG model) that takes possible early exercise of options into account. The AIG model uses AIG’s forfeiture and exercise historical experiences to determine the option value. It also takes into account the illiquid nature of employee options, which the Black-Scholes model does not consider. For these reasons, AIG believes that the AIG model provides a fair value that is more representative of actual historic experience than the value calculated in previous years. The fair values with respect to 2001 were recalculated using the AIG model. The pro forma recognition of such fair value had insignificant impact on the pro forma amounts disclosed above. The fair values of stock options granted during the three years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 were $179 million, $140 million and $195 million, respectively, including $90 million in fair value in 2001 with respect to shares granted in connection with the AGC acquisition. The following weighted average assumptions were used for stock options granted in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively: dividend yields of 0.32 percent, 0.26 percent and 0.19 percent; expected volatilities of 34.0 percent, 34.0 percent and 32.0 percent; risk-free interest rates of 3.57 percent, 4.33 percent and 4.85 percent; and expected terms of 7 years in each year. Also included in the above table is the compensation expense with respect to AIG’s employee stock purchase plan. The fair value calculated was derived by using the AIG model. The pro forma recognition of such fair value had an insignificant impact on the pro forma amounts disclosed above. The fair values of purchase privileges granted during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $12 million, $8 million and $12 million, respectively. The weighted average fair values per share of those purchase rights granted in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $11.64, $12.42 and $17.69, respectively. The fair value of each purchase right was derived at the date of the subscription using the AIG model. The following weighted average assumptions were used for purchase privileges granted in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively: dividend yields of 0.32 percent, 0.26 percent and 0.19 percent; expected volatilities of 34.0 percent, 34.0 percent and 32.0 percent; risk-free interest rates of 1.10 percent, 1.26 percent and 3.17 percent; and expected terms of 1 year.

Stock Compensation Plans (continued)\\n(a) Stock Option Plan: The AIG 1999 Stock Option Plan, as amended (the 1999 Plan), provides that options to purchase a maximum of 45,000,000 shares of common stock can be granted to certain key employees and members of the Board of Directors at prices not less than fair market value at the date of grant. The 1999 Plan limits the maximum number of shares as to which stock options may be granted to any employee in any one year to 900,000 shares. Options granted under this Plan expire not more than 10 years from the date of the grant. Options with respect to 25,000 shares, 25,000 shares, 27,500 shares and 25,000 shares were granted to nonemployee members of the Board of Directors on May 14, 2003, February 10, 2003, May 15, 2002 and May 16, 2001, respectively. These options become exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant, expire 10 years from the date of grant and do not qualify for Incentive Stock Option Treatment under the Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code (ISO Treatment). The 1999 Plan, and the options previously granted thereunder, were approved by the shareholders at the 2000 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, and certain amendments were approved at the 2003 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. At December 31, 2003, 25,800,857 shares were reserved for future grants under the 1999 Plan. The 1999 Plan superseded the 1991 employee stock option plan (the 1991 Plan) and the previously superseded 1987 employee stock option plan (the 1987 Plan), although outstanding options granted under the 1991 Plan continue in force until exercise or expiration. At December 31, 2003, there were 27,607,998 shares reserved for issuance under the 1999 Plan and the 1991 Plan.

This plan provides that equity-based or equity-related awards with respect to shares of common stock can be issued to officers, employees or members of the Board of Directors of AIG in any year up to a maximum of that number of shares equal to (a) 1,000,000 shares plus (b) the number of shares available but not issued in the prior calendar year. Under the Plan, no grantee may receive awards covering more than 250,000 shares of common stock. During 2003 and 2002, AIG granted restricted stock units (RSUs) relating to 222,974 shares and 171,215 shares of common stock to employees, respectively. These RSUs will vest on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant assuming continued employment through such date. AIG reserves the right to make payment for the RSUs in shares of common stock or the cash equivalent on the date of vesting. At December 31, 2003, there were 16,610,361 shares of common stock reserved for issuance in connection with future grants of awards under the Plan.

(d) Employee Stock Purchase Plan: AIG’s 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended and approved by AIG shareholders in 2003 (the 1996 Plan), provides that eligible employees (those employed at least one year) may receive privileges to purchase up to an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of AIG common stock, at a price equal to 85 percent of the fair market value on the date of the grant of the purchase privilege. Purchase privileges are granted annually and are limited to the number of whole shares that can be purchased by an amount equal to 10 percent of an employee’s annual salary or $10,000, whichever is less. There were 516,904 shares, 274,442 shares and 503,847 shares issued under the 1996 plan at weighted average prices of $48.03, $70.76 and $62.02 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The excess or deficit of the proceeds over the par value or cost of the common stock issued was credited or charged to additional paid-in capital. As of December 31, 2003, there were 915,827 shares of common stock subscribed to at a weighted average price of $46.13 per share pursuant to grants of privileges under the 1996 plan.

Employee Benefits\\n(a) Pension Plans: Employees of AIG, its subsidiaries and certain affiliated companies, including employees in foreign countries, are generally covered under various funded and insured pension plans. Eligibility for participation in the various plans is based on either completion of a specified period of continuous service or date of hire, subject to age limitations. AIG’s U.S. retirement plan is a qualified, noncontributory, defined benefit plan which is subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. All employees of AIG and most of its subsidiaries and affiliates who are regularly employed in the United States, including certain U.S. citizens employed abroad on a U.S. dollar payroll, and who have attained age 21 and completed twelve months of continuous service are eligible to participate in this plan. An employee with 5 or more years of service is entitled to pension benefits beginning at normal retirement at age 65. Benefits are based upon a percentage of average final compensation multiplied by years of credited service limited to 44 years of credited service. The average final compensation is\\nsubject to certain limitations. The employee may elect certain options with respect to their receipt of their pension benefits including a joint and survivor annuity. An employee with 10 or more years of service may retire early from age 55 to 64. An early retirement factor is applied resulting in a reduced benefit. If an employee terminates with less than 5 years of service, such employee forfeits the right to receive any pension benefits accumulated to that time. Annual funding requirements are determined based on the “projected unit credit” cost method, which attributes a pro rata portion of the total projected benefit payable at normal retirement to each year of credited service. The HSB retirement plan was merged into the AIG U.S. retirement plan effective April 1, 2001. The AGC retirement plan was merged into the AIG U.S. retirement plan effective January 1, 2002. Employees who participated in the HSB retirement plan prior to April 1, 2001 are entitled to benefits based on the terms and formulas of that plan. Benefits for AGC participants were changed effective January 1, 2003 to be substantially similar to the AIG U.S. retirement plan benefits subject to grandfathering requirements. AIG SunAmerica employees began participation and accruing benefits in the AIG plan on January 1, 2003. Vesting with respect to AIG SunAmerica employees in the AIG plan begins on the later of January 1, 1999 or the date of hire. 21st Century Insurance Group sponsors its own benefit plans for its eligible employees. Assets, obligations and costs with respect to 21st Century’s plans are included herein. The assumptions used in its plans were not significantly different from those used by AIG in AIG’s U.S. plans. The AIG Excess Retirement Income Plan provides a benefit equal to the reduction in benefits payable under the AIG U.S. retirement plan as a result of federal tax limitations on compensation and benefits payable thereunder. AIG has adopted a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (Supplemental Plan) to provide additional retirement benefits to designated executives and key employees. Under the Supplemental Plan, an annual benefit accrues at a percentage of final average pay multiplied by each year of credited service, not greater than 60 percent of final average pay, reduced by any benefits from the current and any predecessor retirement plans (including the AIG Excess Retirement Income Plan and any comparable plans), Social Security, if any, and from any qualified pension plan of prior employers. Currently, each of these plans are unfunded. AGC and HSB have adopted similar supplemental type plans. These plans are also unfunded.'),\n",

Eligibility in the various plans is generally based upon completion of a specified period of eligible service and attaining a specified age. Benefits vary by geographic location. AIG’s U.S. postretirement medical and life insurance benefits are based upon the employee electing immediate retirement and having a minimum of ten years of service. Retirees who were age 65 by May 1, 1989 and their dependents participate in the medical plan at no cost. Employees who retired after May 1, 1989 and prior to January 1, 1993 pay the active employee premium if under age 65 and 50 percent of the active employee premium if over age 65. Retiree contributions are subject to adjustment annually. Other cost sharing features of the medical plan include deductibles, coinsurance and Medicare coordination and a lifetime maximum benefit of $2.0 million. The maximum life insurance benefit prior to age 70 is $32,500, with a maximum of $25,000 thereafter. Effective January 1, 1993, both plans’ provisions were amended.'),\n",

Projected benefit obligations for defined benefit plans represent the present value of pension benefits earned as of December 31, 2003 projected for estimated pay increases as of an assumed date with respect to retirement, termination, disability or death.

Starr & Co., Inc. (Starr), a private holding company, The Starr Foundation and Starr International Company, Inc. (SICO), a private holding company, owned or otherwise controlled approximately 20 percent of the voting stock of AIG at December 31, 2003. Five directors of AIG also serve as directors of Starr and SICO. (b) Transactions with Related Parties: During the ordinary course of business, AIG and its subsidiaries pay commissions to Starr and its subsidiaries for the production and management of insurance business. There are no significant receivables from/payables to related parties at December 31, 2003. Payment for the production of insurance business to Starr aggregated approximately $173 million in 2003, $114 million in 2002 and $87 million in 2001, from which Starr generally is required to pay commissions due originating brokers and its operating expenses. AIG also received approximately $24 million in 2003, $17 million in 2002 and $14 million in 2001 from Starr and paid approximately $114,000 in 2003, $352,000 in 2002 and $320,000 in 2001 to Starr in rental fees and $262,000 for services in 2003, 2002 and 2001. AIG also received approximately $2 million in 2003 and $3 million in 2002 and $4 million in 2001, respectively, from SICO and paid approximately $1 million in each of the years 2003, 2002 and 2001 to SICO as reimbursement for services rendered at cost. AIG also paid to SICO $4 million in 2003, $5 million in 2002, and $4 million in 2001 in rental fees. 19. Acquisition, Restructuring and Related Charges\\nDuring the third quarter of 2001, AGC was acquired and consolidated into AIG; charges in connection with this acquisition totaled $1.36 billion for that quarter. During the second quarter of 2001, AGC incurred $654 million in connection with the termination of its merger agreement with Prudential plc. Thus, in 2001, AIG incurred $2.02 billion of charges in connection with the acquisition of AGC. With respect to the charges of $1.36 billion incurred in the third quarter of 2001, approximately $512 million was related to direct costs of the acquisition. Of the $512 million, $85 million was attributable to investment banking, legal and accounting fees. The remaining direct costs of $427 million were related to employee severance and other termination benefits, and other compensation costs related to change in control agreements with AGC executives. The costs were also based in part on a projected elimination of positions, in accordance with AIG’s postbusiness combination plans, which were intended to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the combined operations. FORM 10-K : 102\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n19. Acquisition, Restructuring and Related Charges (continued)\\nOf the total direct costs of $512 million, $445 million have been paid as of December 31, 2003, including approximately $29 million, $111 million and $305 million paid during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In addition, during 2002, $32 million of liabilities were utilized to absorb other insignificant merger-related expenses. The balance, $35 million, is recorded as a component of “Other Liabilities” as of December 31, 2003. With respect to the elimination of positions, 2,287 terminations were included in AIG’s original postbusiness combination plans. As of December 31, 2003, terminations totaled 2,250; including 536, 1,105 and 609 made during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The remaining 37 terminations are scheduled to occur in 2004, in accordance with AGC’s employee termination program. The indirect costs of $851 million represented charges resulting from post-business combination plans, recognizing that certain assets will have no future economic benefit or ability to generate future revenues. Such charges include asset impairments charges related to software, leasehold improvements and certain goodwill. Also included were certain adjustments associated with conforming AGC’s balances to AIG’s existing accounting policies and methodologies. Of the $851 million, $795 million had been applied as of December 31, 2003; including $13 million, $113 million and $669 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The balance, $56 million, remains outstanding and is reflected as a component of “Other Liabilities” as of December 31, 2003. 20. Special Purpose Vehicles\\nIn January 2003, FASB issued FIN46. FIN46 changes the method of determining whether certain entities should be consolidated in AIG’s consolidated financial statements. An entity is subject to FIN46 and is called a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) if it has (i) equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (ii) equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entity’s operations, or that do not absorb the expected losses or receive the expected returns of the entity. A VIE is consolidated by its primary beneficiary, which is the party that has a majority of the expected losses or a majority of the expected residual returns of the VIE, or both. All other entities not considered VIEs are evaluated for consolidation under existing guidance. In December 2003, FASB issued a revision to Interpretation No. 46 (FIN46R). The provisions of FIN46R are to be applied immediately to VIEs created after January 31, 2003, and to VIEs in which AIG obtains an interest after that date. For VIEs in which AIG holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003, FIN46R was applied as of December 31, 2003. For any VIEs that must be consolidated under FIN 46R that were created before February 1, 2003, the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the VIEs would be initially measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. In accordance with the transition provisions of FIN46R, AIG recorded a gain of $9 million ($14 million before tax) reported as a cumulative effect of an accounting change for the fourth quarter of 2003 and added approximately $4.7 billion of assets and liabilities in its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003. Of the $4.7 billion, approximately $4.2 billion relates to assets and liabilities arising from AIG’s real estate partnerships, principally connected to affordable housing transactions involving AIG SunAmerica subsidiaries, and private equity partnerships managed by AIG Global Investment Group and AIG Capital Partners. The remaining approximately $500 million involves ILFC, and arises principally from a sale-leaseback transaction. The following VIE activities are not consolidated by AIG under FIN46R:\\n•\\nAIG uses VIEs primarily in connection with certain guaranteed investment contract programs (GIC Programs) written by its Life Insurance subsidiaries. In the GIC Programs, AIG’s Life Insurance subsidiaries (principally SunAmerica Life Insurance Company) provide guaranteed investment contracts to VIEs which are not controlled by AIG, and in which AIG does not have a direct variable interest, as defined under FIN 46R, in the entity. The VIE issues notes or bonds which are sold to third party institutional investors. Neither AIG nor the insurance company issuing the GICs has any obligation to the investors in the notes or bonds. The proceeds from the securities issued by the VIE are invested by the VIE in the GICs. The insurance company subsidiaries use their proceeds to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities, primarily investment grade bonds. Both the assets and the liabilities of the insurance companies arising from these GIC Programs are presented in AIG’s consolidated balance sheet. Thus, at December 31, 2003, approximately $36 billion of policyholders’ contract deposits represented liabilities from issuances of GICs included in these GIC Programs, the proceeds of which are used to invest in insurance invested assets.

Special Purpose Vehicles (continued)\\n•\\nAIG manages Collateralized Bond and Loan Obligation trusts (collectively, Collateralized Debt Obligation trusts or “CDO trusts”). As asset manager, AIG receives fees for management of the assets held in the CDO trust, which support the issuance of securities sold by the CDO trust. AIG may take minority equity and/or fixed-income security interest in the CDO trust. AIG has entered into such arrangements to expand its asset management activities. Third-party investors have recourse only to the CDO trust, and have no recourse to AIG. AIG does not consolidate these CDO trusts, pursuant to FIN46R. •\\nAIG’s insurance operations also invest in assets of VIEs. These VIEs are established by unrelated third parties. Investments include collateralized mortgage backed securities and similar securities backed by pools of mortgages, consumer receivables or other assets. The investment in these VIEs allows AIG’s insurance entities to purchase assets permitted by insurance regulations while maximizing their return on these assets. These VIEs are not consolidated by AIG, pursuant to FIN46R. AIGFP is also involved with various special purpose vehicles that are not considered VIEs but rather are considered voting interest entities and are not governed by FIN46R. AIGFP uses such entities as an integral part of its ongoing operations with respect to specific structured transactions with independent third parties. In most instances, AIGFP controls and manages the assets and liabilities with respect to these entities, subject to certain transaction specific limitations. AIGFP generally consolidates these entities under previously issued GAAP guidance. AIGFP also sponsors a Qualified Special Purpose Vehicle (QSPE) that issues commercial paper and secured liquidity notes to third-party institutional investors. This QSPE uses the proceeds of these offerings to obtain beneficial interests in certain financial assets (total assets of approximately $883 million), which serve as collateral for the securities issued by the QSPE. AIGFP provides credit and liquidity support to the QSPE, which is not consolidated by AIG, pursuant to other guidance (QSPEs are generally not subject to FIN46R). 21.'),\n",

The returns of the derivatives are linked to or “derived” from some underlying equity, debt, commodity or other asset, liability, or index. Derivative payments may be based on interest rates and exchange rates and/or prices of certain securities, certain commodities, of financial or commodity indices. These instruments are carried at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet. Collateral is required, at the discretion of AIG, on certain transactions based on the creditworthiness of the counterparty. The vast majority of AIG’s derivative activity is transacted by Capital Markets operations. AIGFP and AIGTG become parties to derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business and to reduce currency, interest rate, commodity and equity exposures. Interest rate, currency, commodity and equity risks related to such instruments are reflected in the consolidated financial statements and are carried at a market or a fair value, whichever is appropriate. The recorded estimated fair values of such instruments may be different than the values that might be realized if AIGFP or AIGTG were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. FORM 10-K : 104\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n21. Derivatives (continued)\\nAIGFP and AIGTG, in the ordinary course of operations and as principal, structure derivative transactions to meet the needs of counterparties who may be seeking to hedge certain aspects of such counterparties’ operations. These companies may also enter into derivative transactions for their own account, primarily to manage risk. Such derivative transactions include interest rate, currency, commodity and equity swaps, swaptions and forward commitments. Interest rate swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. AIGFP and AIGTG typically become a principal in the exchange of interest payments between the parties and, therefore, are exposed to counterparty credit risk and may be exposed to loss, if counterparties default. Currency, commodity and equity swaps are similar to interest rate swaps, but involves the exchange of specific currencies or the cashflows based on the underlying commodity, and equity securities or indices. Also, they may involve the exchange of principal amounts at the beginning and end of the transaction. Swaptions are options where the holder has the right but not the obligation to enter into a swap transaction or cancel an existing swap transaction. At December 31, 2003, the notional principal amount of the sum of the swap pays and receives contracts approximated $1,176.7 billion, primarily related to interest rate swaps of approximately $756.9 billion. Notional amounts represents a standard of measurement of the volume of swaps business of Capital Markets operations. Notional amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and is not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. Notional amounts generally represent those amounts used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received, except for certain contracts such as currency swaps. The timing and the amount of cash flows relating to Capital Markets foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures and options contracts are determined by each of the respective contractual agreements. The following table presents the contractual and notional amounts by maturity and type of derivative of Capital Markets derivatives portfolio at December 31, 2003 and 2002:\\n*\\nNotional amount is not representative of either market risk or credit risk. Futures and forward contracts are contracts that obligate the holder to sell or purchase foreign currencies, commodities or financial indices in which the seller/ purchaser agrees to make/ take delivery at a specified future date of a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield. Options are contracts that allow the holder of the option to purchase or sell the underlying commodity, currency or index at a specified price and within, or at, a specified period of time. As a writer of options, AIGFP generally receives an option premium and then manages the risk of any unfavorable change in the value of the underlying commodity, currency or index by entering into offsetting transactions with third party market participants. Risks arise as a result of movements in current market prices from contracted prices, and the potential inability of the counterparties to meet their obligations under the contracts. At December 31, 2003, the contractual amount of Capital Markets futures, forward and option contracts approximated $250.9 billion. FORM 10-K : 105\\nAmerican International Group, Inc.'),\n",

Derivatives (continued)\\nThe following table presents Capital Markets futures, forward and option contracts portfolio by maturity and type of derivative at December 31, 2003 and 2002:\\nAIGFP enters into credit derivative transactions in the ordinary course of its business. The overwhelming majority of AIGFP’s credit derivatives require AIGFP to provide credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities. AIGFP provides such credit protection only on a “second loss” basis, under which AIGFP’s payment obligations arise only after credit losses in the designated portfolio exceed a specified threshold amount or level of “first losses.” The threshold amount of credit losses that must be realized before AIGFP has any payment obligation is negotiated by AIGFP for each transaction to provide that the likelihood of any payment obligation by AIGFP under each transaction is remote, even in severe recessionary market scenarios. In many cases, the credit risk associated with a designated portfolio is tranched into different layers of risk, which are then analyzed and rated by the credit rating agencies. Typically, there will be an equity layer covering the first credit losses in respect of the portfolio up to a specified percentage of the total portfolio, and then successive layers that are rated, generally a BBB-rated layer, an A-rated layer, an AA-rated layer and an AAA-rated layer. In transactions that are rated, the risk layer or tranche that is immediately junior to the threshold level above which AIGFP’s payment obligation would arise is rated AAA by the rating agencies. For that reason, the risk layer assumed by AIGFP with respect to the designated portfolio in these transactions is often called the “super senior” risk layer, defined as the layer of credit risk senior to a risk layer that has been rated AAA by the credit rating agencies or if the transaction is not rated, equivalent thereto. For example, in a transaction with an equity layer covering credit losses from 0 to 2 percent of the total portfolio, a BBB-rated layer covering credit losses from 2 to 4 percent, an A-rated layer from 4 to 6 percent, an AA-rated layer from 6 to 8 percent and a AAA-rated layer from 8 to 11 percent. AIGFP would cover credit losses arising in respect of the portfolio that exceeded an 11 percent first loss threshold amount, and thereby bear risk that is senior to the AAA-rated risk layer. AIGFP continually monitors the underlying portfolios to determine whether the credit loss experience for any particular portfolio has caused the likelihood of AIGFP having a payment obligation under the transaction to be super senior risk. AIGFP maintains the ability opportunistically to hedge specific securities in a portfolio and thereby further limit its exposure to loss and has hedged outstanding transactions in this manner on occasion. AIGFP has never had a payment obligation under these credit derivatives transactions. Furthermore, based on portfolio credit losses experienced to date under all outstanding transactions, no transaction has experienced credit losses in an amount that has made the likelihood of AIGFP having to make a payment, in AIGFP’s view, to be greater than remote, even in severe recessionary market scenarios. At December 31, 2003, the notional amount with respect to the Capital Markets credit derivative portfolio was $203.0 billion. FORM 10-K : 106\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n21. Derivatives (continued)\\nAIGFP utilizes various credit enhancements, including letters of credit, guarantees, collateral, credit triggers, credit derivatives and margin agreements to reduce the credit exposure relating to these derivative financial instruments. AIGFP requires credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties and the transaction’s size and maturity. In addition, Capital Markets derivative transactions are generally documented under ISDA Master Agreements. Management believes that such agreements provide for legally enforceable set-off and close out netting of exposures to specific counterparties. Under such agreements, in connection with an early termination of a transaction, AIGFP is permitted to set-off its receivables from a counterparty against its payables to the same counterparty arising out of all included transactions. As a result, the fair value represents the net sum of estimated positive fair values after the application of such strategies, agreements and collateral held. After consideration of these credit enhancements, AIGFP has determined that the fair value of its obligations under all interest rate, currency, commodity and equity swaps, options, swaptions and forward commitments, futures and forward contracts approximated $21.60 billion at December 31, 2003 and $17.38 billion at December 31, 2002. The fair value represents the maximum potential loss to AIGFP. AIGFP independently evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties, taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized statistical rating organizations. In addition, AIGFP’s credit approval process involves pre-set counterparty, country and industry credit exposure limits and, for particularly credit intensive transactions, obtaining approval from AIG’s Credit Risk Committee. The average credit rating of Capital Markets operations counterparties as a whole (as measured by AIGFP) is equivalent to AA. The maximum potential loss will increase or decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions. Capital Markets determines counterparty credit quality by reference to ratings from independent rating agencies or, where such ratings are not available, by internal analysis. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the counterparty credit quality with respect to the fair value of Capital Markets derivatives portfolios were as follows:\\n(a)\\nExchange traded futures and options are not deemed to have significant credit exposures as the exchanges guarantee that every contract will be properly settled on a daily basis. (b)\\nThe fair values with respect to exchange traded futures and options, forward contracts and purchased over the counter options are presented as a component of trading assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The fair values with respect to interest rate and currency swaps are presented as a component of unrealized gain on interest rate and currency swaps, options and forward transactions in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the counterparty breakdown by industry with respect to the fair value of Capital Markets derivatives portfolio was as follows:\\n*\\nExchange traded futures and options are not deemed to have significant credit exposures as the exchanges guarantee that every contract will be properly settled on a daily basis.

AIG’s Internet address for its corporate website is www.aigcorporate.com. AIG makes available free of charge, through the Investor Information section of AIG’s corporate website, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). AIG also makes available on its corporate website copies of its charters for its Audit, Nominating and Corporate Governance and Compensation Committees, as well as its Corporate Governance Guidelines and Director Independence Standards. Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful, as well as most transparent. Certain of the measurements used by AIG management are “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules and regulations. Gross premiums written, statutory underwriting profit (loss) and combined ratios are determined in accordance with accounting principles prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities. For an explanation of why AIG management considers these “non-GAAP measures” useful to investors, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. FORM 10-K : 3\\nThe following table shows the general development of the business of AIG on a consolidated basis, the contributions made to AIG’s consolidated revenues and operating income and the assets held, in the periods indicated, by its General Insurance, Life Insurance & Retirement Services, Financial Services and Asset Management operations and other realized capital gains (losses). For additional information, see Selected Financial Data, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 1, 2 and 3 of Notes to Financial Statements. AIG has restated its financial statements for 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - “Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements” for a description of the adjustments included in the restatement and Selected Financial Data and Note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements for a reconciliation of previously reported amounts to the restated amounts.

Domestic General Insurance operations are comprised of the Domestic Brokerage Group (DBG), which includes the operations of HSB; Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (Transatlantic); Personal Lines, including 21st Century Insurance Group (21st Century); and United Guaranty Corporation (UGC). AIG’s primary domestic division is DBG. DBG’s business is derived from brokers in the United States and Canada and is conducted through its General Insurance subsidiaries including American Home, National Union, Lexington and certain other General Insurance company subsidiaries of AIG. DBG writes substantially all classes of business insurance, accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers. This provides DBG the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to submit business to DBG without the traditional agent-company contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no authority to commit DBG to accept a risk. AIG uses managing general agents owned by Starr to produce business in certain lines. See Item 13.'),\n",

In addition to writing substantially all classes of business insurance, including large commercial or industrial property insurance, excess liability, inland marine, environmental, workers compensation and excess and umbrella coverages, DBG offers many specialized forms of insurance such as aviation, accident and health, equipment breakdown, directors and officers liability (D&O), difference-in-conditions, kidnap-ransom, export credit and political risk, and various types of professional errors and omissions coverages. The AIG Risk Management operation provides insurance and risk management programs for large corporate customers. The AIG Risk Finance operation is a leading provider of customized structured insurance products. Also included in DBG are the operations of AIG Environmental, which focuses specifically on providing specialty products to clients with environmental exposures. Lexington writes surplus lines, those risks for which conventional insurance companies do not readily provide insurance coverage, either because of complexity or because the coverage does not lend itself to conventional contracts. Certain of the products of the DBG companies include funding components or have been structured in a manner such that little or no insurance risk is actually transferred.'),\n",

AIG’s personal lines operations engage in mass marketing of personal lines coverages, primarily private passenger auto and personal umbrella coverages, principally through American International Insurance Company and 21st Century. In 2003, AIG acquired the U.S.-based auto and home insurance business of General Electric Company (GE). The business of UGC and its subsidiaries is also included in the domestic operations of AIG. The principal business of the UGC subsidiaries is the writing of residential mortgage loan insurance, which is guaranty insurance on conventional first mortgage loans on single-family dwellings and condominiums. This type of insurance protects lenders against loss if borrowers default. UGC subsidiaries also write home equity and property improvement loan insurance on loans to finance residential property improvements, alterations and repairs and for other purposes not necessarily related to real estate. During 2003, UGC commenced providing guaranty insurance to providers of student loans. UGC had approximately $22 billion of guaranty risk in force at December 31, 2004. AIG’s Foreign General Insurance group accepts risks primarily underwritten through American International Underwriters (AIU), a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned agencies and insurance companies. The Foreign General Insurance group also includes business written by AIG’s foreign-based insurance subsidiaries. The Foreign General group uses various marketing methods and multiple distribution channels to write both business and personal lines insurance with certain refinements for local laws, customs and needs. AIU operates in Asia, the Pacific Rim, the United Kingdom, Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. See also Note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements. During 2004, DBG and the Foreign General Insurance group accounted for 55.4 percent and 23.1 percent, respectively, of AIG’s General Insurance net premiums written. AIG’s General Insurance company subsidiaries worldwide operate primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account and securing reinsurance on that portion of the risk in excess of the limit which they wish to retain. This operating policy differs from that of many insurance\\nFORM 10-K : 5\\ncompanies that will underwrite only up to their net retention limit, thereby requiring the broker or agent to secure commitments from other underwriters for the remainder of the gross risk amount. Certain of DBG’s commercial insurance is reinsured on a quota share basis by AIRCO. Various AIG profit centers, including AIU, AIG Reinsurance Advisors, Inc. and AIG Risk Finance, use AIRCO as a reinsurer for certain of their businesses, and AIRCO also receives premiums from offshore fronting arrangements for clients of AIG subsidiaries. In accordance with permitted accounting practices in Bermuda, AIRCO discounts reserves attributable to certain classes of business assumed from other AIG subsidiaries. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - “Operating Review - Reserve for Losses and Loss Expenses.”\\nThe utilization of reinsurance is closely monitored by senior management and AIG’s Credit Risk Committee. AIG believes that no exposure to a single reinsurer represents an inappropriate concentration of risk to AIG, nor is AIG’s business substantially dependent upon any reinsurance contract. See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements. AIG is diversified both in terms of classes of business and geographic locations. In General Insurance, approximately 13 percent of net premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2004 represented workers compensation business. During 2004, of the direct General Insurance premiums written (gross premiums less return premiums and cancellations, excluding reinsurance assumed and before deducting reinsurance ceded), 12.0 percent and 6.7 percent were written in California and New York, respectively. No other state accounted for more than five percent of such premiums. The majority of AIG’s General Insurance business is in the casualty classes, which tend to involve longer periods of time for the reporting and settling of claims. This may increase the risk and uncertainty with respect to AIG’s loss reserve development. See also the Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated\\nNet Losses and Loss Expense Reserve\\nDevelopment\\nThe reserve for net losses and loss expenses represents the accumulation of estimates for reported losses (“case basis reserves”) and provisions for losses incurred but not reported (IBNR), both reduced by applicable reinsurance recoverable and the discount for future investment income. Losses and loss expenses are charged to income as incurred. Loss reserves established with respect to foreign business are set and monitored in terms of the respective local or functional currency. Therefore, no assumption is included for changes in currency rates. See also Note 1(w) of Notes to Financial Statements. Management reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves through the utilization of a number of analytical reserve development techniques. Through the use of these techniques, management is able to monitor the adequacy of its established reserves and determine appropriate assumptions for inflation. Also, analysis of emerging specific development patterns, such as case reserve redundancies or deficiencies and IBNR emergence, allows management to determine any required adjustments. See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. As a result of its internal review, AIG has determined that its carried reserves for net losses and loss expenses are required to be restated and adjusted. The tables below present those amounts as so restated and adjusted. In addition, AIG has increased the reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures included within the reserve for net losses and loss expenses by $850 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 to reflect a change in estimate. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - “Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements,” “Fourth Quarter 2004 Changes in Estimates” and “Asbestos and Environmental Reserves.” See also Notes 1(cc) and 2 of Notes to Financial Statements. The “Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development” table presents the development of net losses and loss expense reserves for calendar years 1994 through 2004. Immediately following this table is a second table that presents all data on a basis that excludes asbestos and environmental net losses and loss expense reserve development. The opening reserves held are shown at the top of the table for each year end date. The amount of loss reserve discount included in the opening reserve at each date is shown immediately below the reserves held for each year. The undiscounted reserve at each date is thus the sum of the discount and the reserve held. The upper half of the table shows the cumulative amounts paid during successive years related to the undiscounted opening loss reserves. For example, in the table that excludes asbestos and environmental losses, with respect to the net losses and loss expense reserve of $20.87 billion as of December 31, 1997, by the end of 2004 (seven years later) $18.97 billion had actually been paid in settlement of these net loss reserves. In addition, as\\n6 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nreflected in the lower section of the table, the original reserve of $20.87 billion was reestimated to be $21.97 billion at December 31, 2004. This increase from the original estimate would generally result from a combination of a number of factors, including reserves being settled for larger amounts than originally estimated.'),\n",

The redundancy (deficiency) depicted in the table, for any particular calendar year, shows the aggregate change in estimates over the period of years subsequent to the calendar year reflected at the top of the respective column heading. For example, the deficiency of $1.83 billion at December 31, 2004 related to December 31, 2003 net losses and loss expense reserves of $37.58 billion represents the cumulative amount by which reserves for 2003 and prior years have developed deficiently during 2004. The deficiency that has emerged in the last year can be attributed primarily to approximately $750 million in development from claims for accident year 2002 and prior for D&O, and $500 million in development from claims for accident year 2000 and prior for excess casualty. Additionally, the general reinsurance operations of Transatlantic accounted for approximately $300 million of the adverse development in the latest year. Other classes of business contributed deficiencies or redundancies of lesser amounts. For most other classes, accident years 2001 and prior generally produced adverse development in the latest year, whereas accident year 2003 generally produced favorable development. In total, the favorable development for accident year 2003 was approximately $1.6 billion. The accident year emergence can be seen by comparing the respective development in 2004 for each column’s loss reserve in the table that follows. Loss development patterns utilized to test the reserves generally rely on the actual historical loss development patterns of prior accident years for each class of business. Additionally, as shown in the table excluding asbestos and environmental losses below, loss emergence from year end 1994 and 1995 has been favorable on an inception-to-date basis through year end 2004. Loss cost trends deteriorated significantly in the late 1990’s, creating the adverse development for years after 1996. The bottom of each table below shows the remaining undiscounted and discounted net loss reserve for each year. For example, in the table that excludes asbestos and environmental losses, for the 2000 year-end, the remaining undiscounted reserves held as of December 31, 2004 are $8.80 billion, with a corresponding discounted net reserve of $8.21 billion. The reserves for net losses and loss expenses with respect to Transatlantic and 21st Century are included only in consolidated net losses and loss expenses commencing with the year ended December 31, 1998. Reserve development for these operations is included only for 1998 and subsequent periods. Thus, the presentation for 1997 and prior year ends is not fully comparable to that for 1998 and subsequent years in the tables below.

In addition, because not all of AIG’s General Insurance operations are subject to regulatory filing requirements by the states, there are differences between the sum of reserves for losses and loss expenses as filed with the states and the reserves for losses and loss expenses as reported in AIG’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2004. See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements. Life Insurance & Retirement Services Operations\\nAIG’s Life Insurance & Retirement Services subsidiaries offer a wide range of insurance and investment-oriented products both domestically and abroad. Insurance-oriented products consist of individual and group life, payout annuities, endowment and accident and health policies. Investment-oriented products consist generally of fixed and variable annuities. See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations in foreign countries comprised 78.0 percent of Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums and 62.4 percent of Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income in 2004. AIG operates overseas principally through ALICO, AIA, Nan Shan, Philamlife, AIG Star Life, and AIG Edison Life. ALICO is incorporated in Delaware and all of its business is written outside of the United States. ALICO has operations either directly or through subsidiaries in Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, South Asia and the Far East, with Japan being the largest territory. AIG added significantly to its presence in Japan with the acquisition of GE Edison Life Insurance Company (now AIG Edison Life), which was consolidated beginning with the fourth quarter of 2003. AIA operates primarily in China (including Hong Kong), Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam, and India. The operations in India are conducted through a joint venture, Tata AIG Life Insurance Company Limited. Nan Shan operates in Taiwan. Philamlife is the largest life insurer in the Philippines.

There was no significant adverse effect on AIG’s Life Insurance & Retirement Services results of operations from economic environments in any one state, country or geographic region for the year ended December 31, 2004. See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Life insurance products such as whole life and endowment continue to be significant in the overseas companies, especially in Southeast Asia, while a mixture of life insurance, accident and health and retirement services products are sold in Japan. In addition to the above, AIG also has subsidiary operations in Canada, Egypt, Mexico, Poland, Switzerland and Puerto Rico, and conducts life insurance business through a joint venture in Brazil and through an AIUO subsidiary company in Russia, and in certain countries in Central and South America. The Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services companies have over 250,000 full and part-time agents, as well as independent producers, and sell their products largely to indigenous persons in local and foreign currencies. In addition to the agency outlets, these companies also distribute their products through direct marketing channels, such as mass marketing, and through brokers and other distribution outlets, such as financial institutions.

Asset Management Operations\\nAIG’s Asset Management operations comprise a wide variety of investment-related services and investment products, including institutional and retail asset management, broker dealer services and spread-based investment business from the sale of guaranteed investment contracts, also known as funding agreements (GICs). Such products and services are offered to individuals and institutions both domestically and overseas. AIG’s principal Asset Management operations are conducted through certain subsidiaries of AIG Retirement Services, Inc. (AIG SunAmerica), including SAAMCo and the AIG Advisor Group broker dealers and AIG Global Investment Group. AIG SunAmerica sells and manages mutual funds and provides financial advisory services through independent-contractor registered representatives. AIG Global Investment Group manages invested assets on a global basis for third-party institutional, retail, private equity and real estate investment funds, provides securities lending and custodial services and organizes and manages the invested assets of institutional private equity investment funds. Each of these subsidiary operations receives fees for investment products and services provided. See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements. Other Operations\\nCertain other AIG subsidiaries provide insurance-related services such as adjusting claims and marketing specialized products. Several wholly owned foreign subsidiaries of AIG operating in countries such as Ireland, Bermuda, Barbados and Gibraltar provide insurance and related administrative and back office services to a variety of insurance and reinsurance companies. These companies include captive insurance companies unaffiliated with AIG, subsidiaries of AIG and the subsidiaries of holding companies in which AIG holds an interest, such as IPC Holdings, Ltd (IPC) and Allied World Assurance Holdings, Ltd. (AWAC). AIG also has several other subsidiaries which engage in various businesses.

Additional Investments\\nAIG holds a 24.3 percent interest in IPC, a reinsurance holding company, a 23.4 percent interest in AWAC, a property-casualty insurance holding company, and a 24.5 percent interest in The Fuji Fire and Marine Insurance Co., Ltd., a general insurance company. See also Note 1(q) of Notes to Financial Statements. Locations of Certain Assets\\nAs of December 31, 2004, approximately 31 percent of the consolidated assets of AIG were located in foreign countries (other than Canada), including $4.1 billion of cash and securities on deposit with foreign regulatory authorities. Foreign operations and assets held abroad may be adversely affected by political developments in foreign countries, including such possibilities as tax changes, nationalization, and changes in regulatory policy, as well as by consequence of hostilities and unrest. The risks of such occurrences and their overall effect upon AIG vary from country to country and cannot easily be predicted. If expropriation or nationalization does occur, AIG’s policy is to take all appropriate measures to seek recovery of such assets. Certain of the countries in which AIG’s business is conducted have currency restrictions which generally cause a delay in a company’s ability to repatriate assets and profits. See also Notes 1 and 3 of Notes to Financial Statements. Regulation\\nAIG’s operations around the world are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities, investment advisory, banking and thrift regulators in the United States and abroad. The regulatory environment can have a significant effect on AIG and its business. AIG’s operations have become more diverse and consumer-oriented, increasing the scope of regulatory supervision and the possibility of intervention. In addition, the recent investigations into financial accounting practices that led to the restatement of AIG’s financial statements have heightened regulatory scrutiny of AIG worldwide. See “Certain Factors Affecting AIG’s Business - Regulatory Investigations” and Note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements. Certain states require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies that are licensed in such states and are controlled by other corporations. Applicable legislation typically requires periodic disclosure concerning the corporation that controls the registered insurer and the other companies in the holding company system and prior approval of intercorporate services and transfers of assets (including in some instances payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiary) within the holding company system. AIG’s subsidiaries are registered under such legislation in those states that have such requirements. See also Note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements. AIG’s insurance subsidiaries, in common with other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and by other jurisdictions in which they do business. Within the United States, the method of such regulation varies but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory and supervisory powers to an insurance official. The regulation and supervision relate primarily to approval of policy forms and rates, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, including risk-based capital measurements, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on investments, restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, requirements for acceptability of reinsurers, periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies, the form and content of reports of financial condition required to be filed, and reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than the equity owners of these companies. See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. AIG has not yet determined the effect of the restatement on the statutory income, net reserves or surplus of its insurance company subsidiaries. The adjustments that AIG will be required to make to the statutory financial statements may negatively affect certain ratios and other measurements applicable to insurance companies. AIG’s insurance operations are currently under review by various state regulatory agencies, and certain agencies have communicated to AIG concerns in various areas, including allocation of state workers compensation premiums and possible misrepresentations by and sales practices of AIG subsidiaries, including relationships with insurance brokers. AIG cannot at this time determine the effect that these investigations may have on the conduct of its insurance business. See Item 3.'),\n",

Risk-Based Capital (RBC) is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus in relation to the risks\\nFORM 10-K : 13\\ninherent in its business. Thus, inadequately capitalized general and life insurance companies may be identified. The RBC formula develops a risk adjusted target level of statutory surplus by applying certain factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. Higher factors are applied to more risky items and lower factors are applied to less risky items. Thus, the target level of statutory surplus varies not only as a result of the insurer’s size, but also on the risk profile of the insurer’s operations. The RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to placing the insurer under regulatory control. To the extent that any of AIG’s insurance entities would fall below prescribed levels of surplus, it would be AIG’s intention to infuse necessary capital to support that entity. A substantial portion of AIG’s General Insurance business and a majority of its Life Insurance business is carried on in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification or revocation by such authorities, and AIU or other AIG subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. In the past, AIU has been allowed to modify its operations to conform with new licensing requirements in most jurisdictions. In addition to licensing requirements, AIG’s foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, policy language and terms, amount and type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of local investment and the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on participating policies. Some foreign countries regulate rates on various types of policies. Certain countries have established reinsurance institutions, wholly or partially owned by the state, to which admitted insurers are obligated to cede a portion of their business on terms which may not always allow foreign insurers, including AIG, full compensation. In some countries, regulations governing constitution of technical reserves and remittance balances may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets. In 1999, AIG became a unitary thrift holding company when the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) granted AIG approval to organize AIG Federal Savings Bank. Annually, the OTS conducts an examination of AIG. The OTS examination involves assessing the organization’s overall risk profile. Competition\\nAIG’s Insurance, Financial Services and Asset Management businesses operate in a highly competitive environment, both domestically and overseas. Principal sources of competition are insurance companies, banks, investment banks and other non-bank financial institutions. The insurance industry in particular is highly competitive. Within the United States, AIG’s General Insurance subsidiaries compete with approximately 3,100 other stock companies, specialty insurance organizations, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations. AIG’s subsidiaries offering Life Insurance and Retirement Services compete in the United States with approximately 2,100 life insurance companies and other participants in related financial services fields. Overseas, AIG subsidiaries compete for business with foreign insurance operations of the larger U.S. insurers, global insurance groups, and local companies in particular areas in which they are active. AIG’s strong ratings have historically provided a competitive advantage. The effect on the business of AIG of recent regulatory investigations, the restatement, and subsequent ratings actions is currently unknown, but these developments may adversely affect the competitive position of AIG and its subsidiaries. Certain Factors Affecting AIG’s Business\\nAIG’s Credit Ratings\\nThe recent downgrades in AIG’s credit ratings will increase AIG’s borrowing costs, may lessen AIG’s ability to compete in certain businesses and will require AIG to post additional collateral. From March through May of 2005, the major rating agencies downgraded AIG’s ratings in a series of actions. Standard & Poor’s, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (S&P), lowered the long-term senior debt and counterparty ratings of AIG from ‘AAA’ to ‘AA+’ and placed the ratings on Credit Watch Negative. Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) lowered AIG’s long-term senior debt rating from ‘Aaa’ to ‘Aa2’ and placed the ratings on review for possible downgrade. Fitch Ratings (Fitch) downgraded the long-term senior debt ratings of AIG from ‘AAA’ to ‘AA’ and placed the ratings on Ratings Watch Negative. The agencies also took rating actions on AIG’s insurance subsidiaries. S&P and Fitch lowered to ‘AA+’ the insurance financial strength ratings of most of AIG’s insurance companies. Moody’s lowered the insurance financial strength ratings generally to either ‘Aa1’ or ‘Aa2’. A.M. Best downgraded the\\n14 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nfinancial strength ratings for most of AIG’s insurance subsidiaries from ‘A++’ to ‘A+’ and the issuer credit ratings from ‘aa+’ to ‘aa-’. The insurance companies’ ratings remain on a negative watch. In addition, S&P placed ILFC’s ‘AA-’ long-term senior debt rating and ‘A-1+’ short-term rating on Credit Watch Negative. Fitch downgraded ILFC’s long-term senior debt rating from ‘AA-’ to ‘A+’ and placed the rating on Rating Watch Negative and downgraded ILFC’s short-term debt rating from ‘F1+’ to ‘F1’. Fitch also placed the ‘A+’ long-term senior debt ratings of American General Finance Corporation and American General Finance, Inc. on Rating Watch Negative.'),\n",

As such, they may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at AIG management’s request. This discussion of ratings is not a complete list of ratings of AIG and its subsidiaries. These ratings actions have affected and will continue to affect AIG’s business and results of operations in a number of ways. •\\nDowngrades in AIG’s debt ratings will adversely affect AIG’s results of operations. AIG relies on external sources of financing to fund several of its operations. The cost and availability of unsecured financing are generally dependent on the issuer’s long-term and short-term debt ratings. The recent downgrades and any future downgrades in AIG’s debt ratings will increase AIG’s borrowing costs and therefore adversely affect AIG’s results of operations. •\\nThe downgrade in AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings will adversely affect AIGFP’s ability to compete for certain businesses. Credit ratings are very important to the ability of financial institutions to compete in the derivative and structured transaction marketplaces. Historically, AIG’s triple-A ratings provided AIGFP a competitive advantage. The downgrades will reduce this advantage and, for specialized financial transactions that generally are conducted only by triple-A rated financial institutions, counterparties may be unwilling to transact business with AIGFP except on a secured basis. This could require AIGFP to post more collateral to counterparties in the future. See below for a further discussion of the effect that posting collateral may have on AIG’s liquidity. •\\nAlthough the financial strength ratings of AIG’s insurance company subsidiaries remain high compared to many of their competitors, the downgrades have reduced the previous ratings differential. The competitive advantage of the ratings to AIG’s insurance company subsidiaries may be lessened accordingly. The recent regulatory inquiries, internal investigations, and delay in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as negative publicity, have caused independent producers and distributors of AIG’s domestic life and retirement services products to be more cautious in placing business with AIG subsidiaries. AIG is unable to predict the effect of these issues on AIG’s business, including any increase in associated surrender or replacement activity. •\\nAs a result of the downgrades of AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings, AIG has been required to post approximately $1.16 billion of collateral with counterparties to municipal guaranteed investment contracts and financial derivatives transactions. In the event of a further downgrade, AIG will be required to post additional collateral. It is estimated that, as of the close of business on May 18, 2005, based on AIG’s outstanding municipal guaranteed investment contracts and financial derivatives transactions as of such date, a further downgrade of AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings to ‘Aa3’ by Moody’s or ‘AA-’ by S&P would permit counterparties to call for approximately $2.33 billion of additional collateral. Further, additional downgrades could result in requirements for substantial additional collateral, which could have a material effect on how AIG manages its liquidity. The actual amount of additional collateral that AIG would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades depends on market conditions, the market value of the outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade. The requirement to post additional collateral may increase if additional counterparties begin to require credit support from AIG through collateralization agreements. Additional obligations to post collateral will increase the demand on AIG’s liquidity. Regulatory Investigations\\nAIG’s ability to engage in certain businesses may be impaired by the regulatory investigations. The regulatory investigations and civil actions pending against AIG may reduce the willingness of counterparties to engage in business with AIG. Uncertainty concerning the ultimate outcome of these actions and proceedings may also make AIG products and services less attractive in the marketplace. Further, these matters may affect the manner in which certain AIG subsidiaries conduct business and AIG’s ability to obtain regulatory approvals for new lines of business or for further acquisitions. Significant legal proceedings could adversely effect AIG’s results of operations. AIG is party to numerous legal and regulatory proceedings, including matters relating to insur-\\nFORM 10-K : 15\\nance brokerage practices and non-traditional insurance products. See also Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Significant investigations into AIG’s business are continuing and the commencement of additional investigations is possible. Broad-ranging investigations into AIG’s business practices continue in respect of structured transactions, transactions involving insurance brokers, non-traditional insurance products, workers compensation lines and other matters. These investigations are being conducted by a large number of regulators and governmental authorities, and related actions by regulators both within and outside the United States may be undertaken in response.'),\n",

In addition, under the AIG Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Option Plan, non-management directors receive annually an option which vests after one year and is exercisable for nine years thereafter to purchase 2,500 shares of AIG Common Stock at an option price equal to the fair market value of AIG Common Stock on the date of grant, which is the date of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Receipt of shares upon exercise of these options may be deferred at the election of the director. Certain directors who are not employees of AIG also serve as directors of various subsidiaries of AIG and receive fees for meeting attendance. 2.

(3)\\nThe LTIP payouts will be made by SICO pursuant to its 2003-2004 Deferred Compensation Profit Participation Plan. Since 1975, SICO has provided a series of two-year SICO Plans to senior AIG employees (each, a SICO Plan). The original SICO Plan came into being in 1975 when the\\n200 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nvoting shareholders and Board of Directors of SICO, whose principal asset consists of AIG Common Stock, decided that a portion of the capital value of SICO should be used to provide an incentive plan for the current and succeeding management of all American International companies, including AIG. Participation in the SICO Plan by any person, and the amount of such participation, has been at the sole discretion of SICO’s board of directors. Historically, SICO has delivered cash or AIG Common Stock under the SICO Plans; AIG has made no payments. In its restated financial statements AIG has recorded a charge to reported earnings in the periods restated for deferred compensation amounts granted to AIG employees by SICO, with an offsetting entry to additional paid-in capital, reflecting amounts deemed contributed by SICO. AIG is currently in the process of terminating various relationships with SICO and Starr and has authorized the creation of a 2005-2006 Deferred Compensation Profit Participation Plan. This Plan will be modeled after the SICO Plan with respect to the 2003-2004 period, except that it will be administered by AIG and its costs will be borne directly by AIG. In addition, SICO has confirmed and AIG will, subject to certain conditions, assure, that all benefits accrued to employees under the SICO Plans through 2004 will be paid to employees in accordance with the terms of the SICO Plans. (4)\\nAmounts shown do not represent actual payments. Payments do not begin until the employee retires after reaching age 65. Amounts shown in 2004 represent the value, based on the closing sale price of AIG Common Stock on December 31, 2004 ($65.67), of shares of AIG Common Stock contingently allocated with respect to the January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2004 period but not distributed under the 2003-2004 SICO Plan. Amounts shown in 2002 represent the value, based on the closing sale price of AIG Common Stock on December 31, 2002 ($57.85), of shares of AIG Common Stock contingently allocated with respect to the January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2002 period but not distributed under the 2001-2002 SICO Plan.

The values shown for the year 2002 represent the number of AIG shares contingently allocated to the named executive officers as follows: Sullivan - 32,000 shares; Kanak - 32,000 shares; Wintrob - 32,000 shares; Scott - 10,800 shares; Tizzio - 64,000 shares; Tse - 64,000 shares; Martin - 10,800 shares; Moor - 32,000 shares; Neuger - 32,000 shares; Greenberg - 192,000 shares and Smith - 64,000 shares. The right to payouts is subject to forfeiture under certain conditions, including the participant’s termination of employment with AIG and its subsidiaries before normal retirement age other than by death or disability (unless the SICO board determines to reinstate the payment right). The SICO Board of Directors currently may permit the early payout of units under certain circumstances. No executive named in the Summary Compensation Table other than Mr. Martin is eligible for early payout with respect to units awarded to them. Prior to earning the right to payout, the participant is not entitled to any equity interest with respect to underlying shares. In addition, SICO’s board of directors currently makes the final decision whether to pay a participant cash in lieu of shares of AIG Common Stock.

Long-Term Incentive Plans\\nAs discussed in the notes to the Summary Compensation Table, since 1975 SICO has provided a series of two-year Deferred Compensation Profit Participation Plans to senior AIG employees. AIG has authorized the creation of a 2005-2006 Deferred Compensation Profit Participation Plan that will be modeled on the SICO Plan with respect to the 2003-2004 period, except that the 2005-2006 Plan will be administered by AIG and its costs will be borne directly by AIG. AIG has determined the number of units that will be granted to each AIG employee under the 2005-2006 Plan. However, the documentation for the new 2005-2006 Plan has not been finalized or approved and formal awards have not yet been issued. 204 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nThe following table summarizes information with respect to benefits under the forthcoming 2005-2006 Deferred Compensation Profit Participation Plan that will be awarded to the individuals named in the Summary Compensation Table once the 2005-2006 Plan is finalized. Long-Term Incentive Plans\\n(1)\\nAwards represent grants of units that will be made under the forthcoming 2005-2006 Deferred Compensation Profit Participation Plan with respect to the two-year period from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2006. The number of shares of AIG Common Stock, if any, allocated to a unit for the benefit of a participant under the 2005-2006 Plan will be dependent primarily upon two factors: the growth in earnings per share of AIG during the 2005-2006 award period as compared to the 2003-2004 period and the book value of AIG at the end of the award period. As a result, the number of shares to be allocated with respect to units to be awarded for the 2005-2006 period and the value of such shares upon future payout cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 below. (2)\\nThe number of shares to be allocated with respect to units to be awarded for the 2005-2006 period cannot be determined at this time. The ‘Estimated Future Payouts’ column represents the number of shares that would be contingently allocable to the named individuals if, at the end of 2006, the criteria used to allocate shares to units were the same as those used by the Board of Directors of SICO for the 2003-2004 period. However, any share allocation made under the 2005-2006 Plan will be made by the Compensation Committee of AIG’s Board of Directors. Before obtaining the right to a payout, no participant will have any equity interest with respect to shares allocated to him or her and the allocated shares will be subject to forfeiture under certain conditions, including the participant’s voluntary termination of employment with AIG prior to normal retirement age other than by death or disability. Pension Benefits\\nThe executives named in the Summary Compensation Table participate in a series of retirement plans that provide retirement benefits to designated executives and key employees. Under the plans, annual retirement benefits, not to exceed 60 percent of Average Final Compensation, accrue at a rate of 2.4 percent of Average Final Compensation for each year of service or fraction thereof for each full month of active employment. The benefit payable under the plans is reduced by payments from Social Security and any payments from a qualified pension plan of a prior employer. Certain of the plans allow participants over the age of 70 1/2 the option to commence their benefits while still employed. The benefit cannot commence until at least one year after the date of such election. FORM 10-K : 205\\nAnnual amounts of normal retirement pension commencing at normal retirement age of 65 based upon Average Final Compensation and credited service under these retirement plans are illustrated in the following table:\\nEstimated Annual Pension at Age 65\\nThe respective years of credited service for the individuals named in the Summary Compensation Table through December 31, 2004 are as follows: Sullivan - 25.4 years; Kanak - 12.5 years; Wintrob - 4.5 years; Scott - 10.33; Tizzio - 36.67 years; Tse - 43.5 years; Moor - 19.75 years; Neuger - 9.33 years; Smith - 20.3 years. For purposes of the plans, Average Final Compensation is the average pensionable salary of a participant during the three consecutive years in the last ten years of his credited service affording the highest such average, or during all of the years of his credited service if less than three years. Pensionable salary includes the regular salary paid by AIG and its subsidiaries and does not include amounts attributable to supplementary bonuses or overtime pay. For such named individuals, pensionable salary during 2004 was as follows: Sullivan - $675,962; Kanak - $655,000; Wintrob - $650,000; Scott - $525,000; Tizzio - $654,700; Tse - $661,156; Moor - $551,298; Neuger - $621,154; Smith - $631,154. Mr. Martin has accrued an estimated annual benefit payable upon retirement at normal retirement age at 65 from all applicable AIG and AGC plans of $203,381. Mr. Greenberg elected to commence his retirement plan benefits on October 1, 2004. His total annual benefit from the retirement plans is $1,637,532 payable in the form of a 100 percent joint and survivor annuity. 3. Relationships with Starr and SICO\\nA number of senior AIG executives, including the individuals named in the Summary Compensation Table, have historically held positions with, and received compensation from, Starr and SICO. Both companies own substantial amounts of AIG common stock and have had other relationships with AIG. For example, from time to time, Starr has offered members of AIG’s senior management the opportunity to purchase shares of its common stock and, since 1975, SICO has provided a series of two-year Deferred Compensation Profit Participation Plans to certain senior AIG employees.

PNC Settlement\\nIn November 2004, AIG and AIGFP reached a final settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Fraud Section of the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Indiana with respect to issues arising from certain structured transactions entered into with Brightpoint, Inc. and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC), the marketing of transactions similar to the PNC transactions and related matters. As part of the settlement, the SEC filed a civil complaint against AIG, alleging violations of certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and for aiding and abetting violations of reporting and record keeping provisions of those laws. The SEC’s complaint was based on the conduct of AIG, primarily through AIGFP (i) in developing, marketing and entering into three transactions during 2001 that were intended to en-\\n16 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nable PNC, a public company, to remove certain assets from its balance sheet and (ii) in marketing similar transaction structures to other potential counterparties. The complaint alleged, inter alia, that AIGFP recklessly misrepresented, and was reckless in not knowing, that the transactions entered into with PNC and marketed to other potential counterparties did not satisfy the requirements of GAAP for non-consolidation of special purpose entities. AIG, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, consented to the issuance of a final judgment: (a) permanently enjoining it and its employees and related persons from violating section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and from aiding and abetting violations of sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13; (b) ordering it to disgorge the $39,821,000 in fees that it received from the PNC transactions, plus prejudgment interest of $6,545,000; and (c) providing for AIG to establish a transaction review committee to review the appropriateness of certain future transactions and to retain an independent consultant to examine certain transactions entered into between 2000 and 2004 and review the policies and procedures of the transaction review committee. The independent consultant has a broad mandate to review transactions entered into by AIG during this period.'),\n",

The DOJ filed a criminal complaint against AIGFP PAGIC Equity Holding Corp. (AIGFP PAGIC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of AIGFP. The complaint alleged that AIGFP PAGIC violated federal securities laws by aiding and abetting securities law violations by PNC, in connection with a transaction entered into in 2001 with PNC that was intended to enable PNC to remove certain assets from its balance sheet. The complaint alleges that AIGFP PAGIC knew, or was deliberately ignorant in not knowing, that the PNC transaction did not satisfy the requirements of GAAP for non-consolidation of special purpose entities. The AIGFP PAGIC transaction was the last of three similar transactions developed, marketed and entered into by AIGFP and its subsidiaries with PNC during 2001. The DOJ had notified AIGFP that, in its view, AIGFP acting through certain of its employees may have violated federal criminal law in connection with the PNC transactions and the marketing of similar transaction structures to other potential counterparties. The settlement with the DOJ consists of separate agreements with AIG and AIGFP and a complaint filed against, and deferred prosecution agreement with, AIGFP PAGIC. Under the terms of the settlement, AIGFP paid a monetary penalty of $80 million and, provided that AIG, AIGFP and AIGFP PAGIC satisfy their obligations under the DOJ agreements, the DOJ will seek a dismissal with prejudice of the AIGFP PAGIC complaint after 13 months and will not prosecute AIG or AIGFP in connection with the PNC transactions or the Brightpoint transaction that was settled by AIG with the SEC in 2003. The obligations of AIG, AIGFP and AIGFP PAGIC under the DOJ agreements relate principally to cooperating with the DOJ and other federal agencies in connection with their related investigations. Investigations of Insurance Brokerage Practices\\nOn October 14, 2004, the Office of the New York State Attorney General (NYAG) brought a lawsuit challenging certain insurance brokerage practices related to contingent commissions. Neither AIG nor any of its subsidiaries is a defendant in that action, although two employees of an AIG subsidiary pleaded guilty in connection with the Attorney General’s investigation in October 2004 and two additional employees of the same subsidiary pleaded guilty in February 2005.'),\n",

Regulators from several additional states have commenced investigations into the same matters, and AIG expects there will be additional investigations as well. Various parties, including insureds and shareholders, have also asserted putative class action and other claims against AIG or its subsidiaries alleging, among other things, violations of the antitrust and federal securities laws, and AIG expects that additional claims may be made. Various federal and state regulatory agencies are reviewing certain other transactions and practices of AIG and its subsidiaries in connection with industry-wide and other inquiries. Investigation and Civil Complaint Concerning Non-Traditional Insurance Products and Other Transactions\\nIn February 2005, AIG received subpoenas from the NYAG and the SEC relating to investigations into the use of non-traditional insurance products and certain assumed reinsurance transactions and AIG’s accounting for such transactions. In March and April 2005, the SEC and NYAG issued additional subpoenas relating to certain transactions and entities discussed more fully in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including, among others, SICO, Union Excess, Capco and certain Life Settlements (as such transactions and entities are defined in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations). In April 2005, AIG received a subpoena from the NYAG relating to AIG’s opera-\\nFORM 10-K : 17\\ntions in Bermuda. The United States Department of Justice and state regulators, including the New York Department of Insurance (NY DOI), are also investigating these issues. Regulators from several additional states have commenced investigations into some of these matters, and AIG expects there will be additional investigations. In addition, the SEC, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York and the NYAG are investigating certain transactions involving the purchase of AIG stock. The NYAG and insurance regulators are investigating issues relating to workers compensation insurance written by AIG subsidiaries. Various former and current employees of AIG have also received subpoenas from the SEC and NYAG seeking documents and testimony concerning some of these matters. AIG has cooperated, and will continue to cooperate, with all these investigations, including by producing documents and other information in response to the subpoenas. As more fully described in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, AIG has concluded that the accounting for certain transactions and certain relationships needs to be restated or adjusted. See Note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements. On May 26, 2005, the NYAG and the New York Superintendent of Insurance filed a civil complaint against AIG as well as its former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer M.R. Greenberg, and former Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer Howard Smith, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York. The complaint asserts claims under New York’s Martin Act and Insurance Law, among others, and makes allegations concerning certain of the transactions discussed more fully in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including, among others, Gen Re, Capco, AIRCO Reinsurance, Life Settlements, Richmond and Union Excess. The complaint seeks disgorgement, injunctive relief, punitive damages and costs, among other things. The NYAG has also stated that it fully expects that all issues with AIG concerning these matters can be resolved civilly, as opposed to by means of criminal indictment of AIG. Other Actions\\nA number of lawsuits have been filed regarding the subject matter of the investigations of insurance brokerage practices, including derivative actions, individual actions and class actions under the federal securities laws, ERISA and state common and corporate laws in both federal and state courts, including the federal district court in the Southern District of New York, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Superior Court and in Delaware Chancery Court. All of these actions generally allege that AIG and its subsidiaries violated the law by allegedly concealing a scheme to “rig bids” and “steer” business between insurance companies and insurance brokers as described in “Investigation of Insurance Brokerage Practices” above. Between October 19, 2004 and May 23, 2005, AIG was named as a defendant in twelve complaints that were filed in federal court and one that was originally filed in Florida state court and removed to federal court. These cases generally allege that AIG and its subsidiaries violated federal and various state antitrust laws, as well as federal RICO laws, various state deceptive and unfair practice laws and certain state laws governing fiduciary duties. The alleged basis of these claims is that there was a conspiracy between insurance companies and insurance brokers with regard to the bidding practices for insurance coverage in certain sectors of the insurance industry. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation entered an order consolidating most of these cases and transferring them to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The remainder of these cases are in the process of being transferred to the District of New Jersey.'),\n",

These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only AIG’s belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside AIG’s control. These statements may address, among other things, the status and potential future outcome of the current regulatory and civil proceedings against AIG and their potential effect on AIG’s businesses, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity, the effect of the credit rating downgrades on AIG’s businesses and competitive position, the effect of the severing of ties between AIG and Starr and SICO, AIG’s strategy for growth, product development, market position, financial results and reserves. It is possible that AIG’s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause AIG’s actual results to differ, possibly materially, from those in the specific forward-looking statements are discussed under “Certain Factors Affecting AIG’s Business” in Item 1 of Part I and throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. AIG is not under any obligation (and expressly disclaims any such obligations) to update or alter any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 30 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nRestatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements\\nSubpoenas.

The United States Department of Justice and various state regulators are also investigating related issues. During these investigations, in March 2005, AIG’s then Chairman and Chief Executive Officer retired. In addition, AIG’s then Chief Financial Officer was terminated for failure to cooperate in the investigations. Subsequently, certain other AIG executives, including its former comptroller, were terminated for similar reasons. On May 26, 2005, the NYAG and the New York Superintendent of Insurance filed a civil complaint against AIG relating to these investigations.

In connection with the preparation of AIG’s consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, AIG’s current management initiated an internal review of AIG’s books and records, which was substantially expanded in mid-March. The internal review, conducted under the direction of current senior management with the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, spanned AIG’s major business units globally, and included a review of information and a number of transactions from 2000 to the present. In certain cases, items in periods prior to 2000 were examined due to the nature of the transactions under review. The business units subject to review were Domestic General Insurance, Foreign General Insurance, Reinsurance, Financial Services, Domestic and Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services and Asset Management. The internal review encompassed AIG’s books and records, thousands of files and e-mails and interviews with current and former employees and members of management. Management believes that the scope and process of its internal review was sufficient to identify issues of a material nature that could affect AIG’s financial statements. AIG’s internal review was complemented by investigations by outside counsel for AIG and for the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm (PwC or independent auditors), was consulted on the scope of the internal review for certain matters and reviewed the results of the internal review. As a result of the findings of the internal review, together with the results of investigations conducted by outside counsel at the request of AIG’s Audit Committee and in consultation with AIG’s independent auditors, AIG has concluded that the accounting for certain transactions and certain relationships needs to be restated or adjusted.'),\n",

AIG has restated its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2004 and 2003 and the quarter ended December 31, 2003. AIG’s previously issued financial statements for these and prior periods should no longer be relied upon. See Selected Financial Data and Note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements for a reconciliation of previously reported amounts to the restated amounts. As part of its internal review, AIG evaluated the financial reporting consolidation process and the resulting financial statements as well as the appropriateness of AIG’s prior accounting and reporting decisions. Based on this evaluation, the restatement includes corrections of errors in current or prior accounting periods for improper or inappropriate transactions or entries identified by the review. In many cases these transactions or entries appear to have had the purpose of achieving an accounting result that would enhance measures believed to be important to the financial community and may have involved documentation that did not accurately reflect the true nature of the arrangements. In certain instances, these transactions or entries may also have involved misrepresentations to members of management, regulators and AIG’s independent auditors. The restatement includes adjustments, some of which had been previously identified but considered not to be sufficiently material to require correction. In addition, AIG has determined that certain accounts should be adjusted for the year ended December 31, 2004 to reflect changes in estimates made in the fourth quarter of 2004. The aggregate effect of these changes in estimates resulted in an after tax charge of approximately $1.19 billion. See “Fourth Quarter 2004 Changes in Estimates” herein and Note 1(cc) of Notes to Financial Statements. Details of Accounting Adjustments included in the Restatement. The accounting adjustments relate primarily to the categories described below. Many of the adjustments that do not affect previously reported net income or consolidated shareholders’ equity do, however, change both the consolidated and business segment reporting of premiums, underwriting results, net investment income, realized capital gains and losses and operating income, as well as other items. Adjustments that affect reported net income and consolidated shareholders’ equity relate to both the timing and recognition of revenues and expenses and affect the comparison of period-to-period results. Following the description of each transaction, accounting entry or entity category is a summary of the principal consolidated\\nFORM 10-K : 31\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nstatement of income and balance sheet accounts affected by the adjustments relating to that category. •\\nRisk Transfer. To recognize the cash flows under an insurance contract as premium and losses, GAAP requires the transfer of risk. If risk transfer requirements are not met, an insurance contract is accounted for as a deposit, resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract as deposit assets or liabilities and not as revenues or expense. AIG has concluded, based upon its internal review, that there was insufficient risk transfer to qualify for insurance accounting for certain transactions where AIG subsidiaries either wrote direct insurance or assumed or ceded reinsurance. These transactions are now recorded using deposit accounting.'),\n",

Eliminating the cessions reduces reinsurance assets, effectively eliminates the inherent discount related to the loss reserves ceded under the contracts, and increases net premiums and losses. It should be noted that any income earned on the deposit assets in future periods would increase net investment income in those periods.'),\n",

(SICO), Union Excess is now included in AIG’s consolidated financial statements. The facts and circumstances surrounding SICO’s involvement with Union Excess were not properly reflected in AIG’s books and records, were not known to all relevant AIG financial reporting personnel and, AIG now believes, were not known to AIG’s independent auditors. For example, a significant portion of the ownership interests of Union Excess shareholders are protected against loss under financial arrangements with SICO. Additionally, from its formation in 1991, Union Excess has reinsured risks emanating primarily or solely from AIG subsidiaries, both directly and indirectly. Further, it appears that the employees responsible for the reinsurance related to Union Excess managed that relationship to prevent significant losses or gains to Union Excess so that substantially all of the risks and rewards of the underlying reinsurance inured to AIG. This relationship allowed AIG to absorb substantially all the economic returns, which in turn caused Union Excess to be deemed a variable interest entity (VIE). The effect of the adjustments and restatement relating to Union Excess on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts is as follows:\\n-\\nGen Re: In December 2000 and March 2001, an AIG subsidiary entered into an assumed reinsurance transaction with a subsidiary of General Re Corporation (Gen Re) involving two tranches of $250 million each. In connection with each tranche, consolidated net premiums written and consolidated incurred policy losses and benefits increased by $250 million in the fourth quarter of 2000 (with respect to the first tranche) and the first quarter of 2001 (with respect to the second tranche). The first tranche of the transaction was commuted in November 2004, reducing premiums and reserves for losses and loss expenses by approximately $250 million in the fourth quarter 2004. AIG has concluded that the transaction was done to accomplish a desired accounting result and did not entail sufficient qualifying risk transfer. As a result, AIG has determined that the transaction should not have been recorded as insurance. AIG’s restated financial statements recharacterize the transaction as a deposit rather than as insurance. This adjustment also includes the effects of a related commutation in 2001. Such recharacterization had virtually no effect on net income or consolidated shareholders’ equity but had the\\n32 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nfollowing effects on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts:\\n-\\nOther Risk Transfer: AIG has concluded that Richmond Insurance Company, Ltd., a Bermuda-based reinsurance holding company (Richmond) in which AIG currently holds a 19.9 percent ownership interest, should be treated as a consolidated entity in AIG’s financial statements due to AIG’s ability to exert control over that entity. Such determination was based, in part, on arrangements and documents, including put agreements requiring an AIG subsidiary to purchase the Richmond shares, that appear not to have been previously disclosed to appropriate AIG financial personnel or AIG’s independent auditors. Although AIG currently owns only a minority ownership interest in Richmond, a review of the operations of Richmond and its subsidiaries has shown significant previously undisclosed evidence of AIG control causing Richmond to be deemed a VIE. The consolidation of Richmond had virtually no effect on net income or consolidated shareholders’ equity. AIG has received notice of exercise of a put with respect to 49.9 percent of the Richmond shares and expects to acquire the shares by June 30, 2005. As a result of its internal review of AIG Re, AIG Risk Finance and AIG Risk Management and certain transactions, AIG determined that adjustments were required because certain transactions lacked sufficient risk transfer to qualify for insurance accounting under GAAP. The effect of the adjustments and restatement for Richmond, AIG Re, AIG Risk Finance, AIG Risk Management and certain other transactions on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts is as follows:\\n•\\nLoss Reserves: Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses is a complex process requiring the use of assumptions which may be highly uncertain at the time of estimation. As a result of its internal review, AIG has determined that the IBNR included in the General Insurance reserve for losses and loss expenses was adjusted on a regular basis without appropriate support for the changes requested to be made. Although AIG does not believe that any change materially affected the integrity of AIG’s loss reserve position because in each instance IBNR as adjusted was determined to be within an appropriate tolerance of the applicable actuarial point estimate, AIG has determined that the unsupported decreases in reserves generated independently from the actuarial process constituted errors which should be corrected\\nFORM 10-K : 33\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nand has restated the amounts of carried reserves accordingly. As a result, the fourth quarter 2002 charge relating to the increase in the General Insurance reserve for losses and loss expenses, previously reported as $2.8 billion, has been restated to $2.1 billion to reduce the original charge by the cumulative effect of the correction of the unsupported adjustments to reserves through that date (approximately $700 million). Therefore, the charge to pretax earnings is approximately $700 million less than previously reported, reflecting the removal of the unsupported adjustments to reserves in periods prior to and including the fourth quarter of 2002. The effect of the adjustments and restatement of the loss reserves on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts is set forth as follows:\\n•\\nNet Investment Income. As a result of the internal review, AIG determined that the accounting for certain transactions had the effect of improperly converting capital gains into net investment income and was not consistent with GAAP. The most significant of these transactions are:\\n-\\nCovered Calls: From 2001 through 2003, certain AIG subsidiaries entered into a series of transactions with third parties whereby these subsidiaries sold in-the-money calls, principally on municipal bonds in their investment portfolios that had unrealized appreciation associated with them. Upon exercise of a call, the related bonds were delivered to the purchaser of the call and subsequently reacquired by the subsidiaries pursuant to contingent forward agreements which permitted the AIG subsidiaries to repurchase the bonds at the prevailing market value. In connection with selling the calls, the AIG subsidiaries also entered into interest rate swaps to protect them against the effects of changes in value of the applicable bonds as a result of movements in interest rates during the transaction period. These transactions were accounted for as sales and subsequent purchases and appear to have been initiated to increase net investment income. AIG has determined that, because AIG was able to cause the bonds to be returned from the third parties even after the third parties exercised the call options, AIG did not cede control over the bonds and therefore the transactions should not have been accounted for as sales and subsequent purchases but rather as financings. The adjustments required to correct this error reduce previously reported amounts of net investment income and correspondingly increase realized capital gains from these transactions over the three-year period. The adjustments and restatement had no net effect on consolidated shareholders’ equity for any period and the following effects on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income accounts:\\n-\\nSynthetic Fuel Investment: AIG subsidiaries invest in certain limited liability companies that invest in synthetic fuel production facilities as a means of generating income tax credits. As a result of a misapplication of GAAP, AIG recorded net investment income or, in some cases, other revenues, on a pretax basis rather than reflecting the tax credit as a reduction of income tax expense, thereby increasing net investment income for AIG’s life insurance and retirement services segment and other revenues for the financial services segment. Certain of these entries were previously identified but not corrected as the amounts were viewed as not sufficiently material to require correction. In the fourth quarter of 2004, AIG changed its accounting to present these tax credits as a component of income taxes. AIG has now determined that it is necessary to record these adjustments for the periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2004. These adjustments had no effect on consolidated net income or shareholders’ equity but had the following effects on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income accounts:\\n34 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\n-\\nHedge Fund Accounting: AIG subsidiaries invest in a variety of alternative asset classes, including hedge fund limited partnerships, that are accounted for as available for sale securities. As part of the underlying partnership agreements, such AIG subsidiaries have the right to redeem their interests at defined times. A redemption allows AIG to record net investment income to the extent there are gains in the underlying funds at the time. However, as a result of its internal review, AIG has determined that, in certain cases, the redemption resulted in inappropriate gain recognition because the proceeds were required to be immediately reinvested in the funds. In addition, the cost bases of certain funds were misallocated in determining gains. The restated consolidated financial statements correct these errors. These corrections had virtually no effect on consolidated shareholders’ equity but had the following effects on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income accounts. -\\nMuni Tender Option Bond Program: From 2000 through early 2003, AIG subsidiaries participated in a program in which they transferred highly rated municipal bonds at market value to a third-party broker, which in turn transferred these securities to a trust that the broker had established. The trust then issued two sets of beneficial interests.'),\n",

The remaining beneficial interests were “inverse” floating interest rate certificates. Third parties invested in the floating interest rate certificates, and AIG subsidiaries invested in the inverse floating interest rate certificates. AIG did not consolidate the trust into AIG’s balance sheet. The AIG subsidiaries, as the holders of the residual interest inverse floating rate certificates, had the right to unilaterally liquidate the trust and cause the municipal bonds to be returned to AIG on short notice. Accordingly, the AIG subsidiaries did not cede control over the bonds. As a result, AIG now believes that the conclusion not to consolidate was an error in the application of GAAP. Therefore, AIG has now consolidated the trusts into its balance sheets at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. The consolidations had no effect on consolidated shareholders’ equity but had the following effects on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts:\\n-\\nDBG/AIG Capital Corporation Intercompany Dividend: In 2002, AIG Capital Corporation issued shares of its preferred stock to National Union in exchange for shares of ILFC’s common stock. AIG did not eliminate the preferred stock investment in consolidation, instead recording the dividend as income in net investment income and as corresponding expense in other operating expenses. AIG has now determined that this accounting is a misapplication of GAAP. Accordingly, AIG has eliminated this intercompany investment and reversed the accounting entries in its consolidated statement of income. The adjustments and restatement had no effect on consolidated net income or shareholders’ equity but had the following effects on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income accounts:\\n•\\n“Top Level” Adjustments and Other Directed Entries (other than loss reserves). Certain accounting entries originated at the parent company level had the effect of reclassifying realized capital gains to net investment income, as well as adjusting other line item reclassifications and other segment financial information. In some cases, expense deferrals were increased or reserves decreased, both having the effect of increasing reported earnings. In other\\nFORM 10-K : 35\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\ncases, the adjustments affected revenue and expense recognition between reporting periods or among business segments. Certain of these entries were previously identified but considered not to be sufficiently material to require correction.'),\n",

Due to the limited availability of long-duration bonds or bonds with sufficient yield to meet the policyholder liability requirements in Japan and Southeast Asia, AIG subsidiaries made alternative investments, including investments in equities. Until the fourth quarter of 2003, a portion of the capital gains realized on these alternative investments, including substantial amounts related to the sale of fixed income securities, was reclassified to net investment income in the consolidated statement of income to match these revenues against the incurred policy benefit expense of the underlying policies. Amounts so reflected, which were previously identified but not corrected as they were viewed as immaterial, are treated as corrections of errors in the restated financial statements, and are as follows: $57 million, $448 million, $278 million, $129 million, and $87 million for 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Beginning in the first quarter of 2004, a process was implemented to identify only certain equity-related gains in Southeast Asia and a limited amount of fixed income and equity gains in Japan and to segregate and treat such realized capital gains separately for segment reporting purposes only. The new process and limits were applied retroactively for 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000 as part of the restatement. The restatement reverses all such unsupported “top level” and other directed entries, including the Foreign Life Insurance Net Investment Income Reclassification, with the following effect on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts:\\n•\\nConversion of Underwriting Losses to Capital Losses. This category includes transactions and entries that had the principal effect of improperly recharacterizing underwriting losses as capital losses. Although these errors have a minimal effect on consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2004, they have an effect on underwriting results in each year. This category also includes insurance and reinsurance transactions where AIG’s accounting resulted in errors relating to the timing and classification of income recognition as well as errors relating to the timing of premium recognition. The most significant transactions in this category are the following:\\n-\\nCapco: AIG has determined that a series of transactions with Capco Reinsurance Company, Ltd. (Capco), a Barbados-domiciled reinsurer, involved an improper structure created to recharacterize underwriting losses relating to auto warranty business as capital losses. That structure, which appears to have not been properly disclosed to appropriate AIG personnel or its independent auditors, consisted primarily of arrangements between subsidiaries of AIG and Capco that require Capco to be treated as a consolidated entity in AIG’s financial statements. The result of such consolidation is to reverse capital losses for the years\\n36 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\n2000 through 2003 and recognize a corresponding amount of underwriting losses in 2000. -\\nThe Robert Plan: AIG has restated the accounting for surplus notes purchased as part of a litigation settlement in 2002 with The Robert Plan Corporation (The Robert Plan). Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the surplus notes were to be repaid through profits received from a managing general agency relationship with The Robert Plan. When AIG deemed that repayment under the surplus notes was unlikely, AIG recorded the impairment charge as realized capital losses rather than underwriting losses. AIG now believes that this accounting treatment was an error and has restated the impairment charges as underwriting losses. -\\nAIRCO Reinsurance: In each of 1999 and 2000, AIRCO entered into stop loss reinsurance agreements with Union Excess relating to accident and health business of Nan Shan. Concurrently with each reinsurance agreement, AIRCO entered into a swap agreement with Union Excess, under which the payments were linked to payments under the reinsurance agreement. The transaction had the effect of converting incurred policy losses into capital losses. AIG has determined that its prior accounting was a misapplication of GAAP and has reversed both the cessions under the reinsurance agreement and the corresponding swaps. The effect of these adjustments and restatement on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts is as follows:\\n•\\nAsset Realization. As a result of the internal review, AIG concluded that adjustments should be made to the value of certain assets included in its consolidated balance sheet. The most significant of these items are:\\n-\\nDomestic Brokerage Group (DBG) Issues: A review of allowances for doubtful accounts and other accruals recorded by certain DBG member companies has led AIG to conclude that the allowances related to certain premiums receivable, reinsurance recoverables and other assets were not properly analyzed in prior periods and that appropriate allowances were not properly recorded in AIG’s consolidated financial statements. Certain relevant information was known by certain members of senior management but, AIG now understands, not previously disclosed to the independent auditors. In addition, various accounts were not properly reconciled. AIG’s restated financial statements reflect the recording of appropriate amounts for these reserves and allowances for doubtful accounts for the appropriate time period, resulting in an after-tax reduction in consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 1999 of $514 million. Because all of the reporting periods affected by these adjustments were prior to 2000, the restatement results in decreases in insurance acquisition and other operating expenses in 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000. The effect of the adjustments and restatement resulting from DBG issues on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts is as follows:\\n-\\nOther Than Temporary Declines: AIG’s investment accounting policies require that an investment that has been identified as impaired should be written down in the period in which such impairment is determined, and recorded as a realized capital loss. AIG has determined that realized capital losses with respect to certain impaired investments were not recorded in the appropriate periods, and the restate-\\nFORM 10-K : 37\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nment will thus affect the timing of previously reported realized capital losses. The adjustments and restatement resulting from other than temporary declines had only a minor effect on consolidated shareholders’ equity but affected certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income accounts as follows:\\n•\\nOther GAAP Corrections. As part of its internal review, AIG has considered the application of certain accounting principles to specific businesses and transactions, and has determined that certain misapplications of GAAP are errors that require restatement of its financial statements. These adjustments include the following:\\n-\\nAccounting for Derivatives (FAS 133 Hedge Accounting): AIG and its subsidiaries, including AIGFP, engage in hedging activities for their own accounts, which AIG believes have been and remain economically effective. AIG and its subsidiaries enter into derivative contracts principally to hedge interest rate risk and foreign currency risk associated with their assets, liabilities and forecasted cash flows. Such derivative transactions include interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forwards, which are generally executed through AIGFP. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 - “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (FAS 133) requires that third-party derivatives used for hedging must be specifically matched with the underlying exposures to an outside third party and documented contemporaneously to qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The internal review determined that in many cases AIG did not meet these hedging requirements with respect to certain hedging transactions. See the discussion under “Derivatives” herein. AIG has historically reported the changes in the fair value of certain derivatives used for hedging activities through other comprehensive income in consolidated shareholders’ equity or in net income with a corresponding adjustment to the hedged item, depending on the nature of the hedging relationship. In order to comply with FAS 133, the restated consolidated financial statements include the changes in fair value for certain derivatives, previously recorded through other comprehensive income, in current period income and reverse the previous adjustments on certain assets and liabilities recorded in income in connection with hedge accounting. Because these activities did not qualify for hedge accounting, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 - “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” requires AIG to recognize the corresponding changes in fair value, including foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate fluctuations, relating to available-for-sale investments through accumulated other comprehensive income. These restatement adjustments with respect to FAS 133 do not result in any changes in AIG’s liquidity or its overall financial condition even though inter-period volatility of earnings increases. 38 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nAIG is assessing the cost and benefits of modifying its hedging activities to obtain hedge accounting under the requirements of FAS 133. The adjustments and restatement to reflect appropriate GAAP accounting for these derivatives, which also included reclassifications between the accounts securities available for sale, at market value and securities purchased under agreements to resell, at contract value, had the following effects on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts:\\n-\\nAccounting for Deferred Taxes: AIG identified certain misapplications of GAAP in its provision for deferred income taxes as follows:\\nFor certain foreign subsidiaries for which AIG has plans to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings, AIG incorrectly provided U.S. deferred taxes on the unrealized appreciation associated with investment securities in accumulated other comprehensive income. For certain foreign subsidiaries for which AIG does not have plans for permanent reinvestment of undistributed earnings, U.S. deferred taxes were incorrectly omitted on certain components of other comprehensive income. These adjustments and restatement had the following effects on consolidated net income and shareholders’ equity:\\n-\\nForeign Currency Translation (FAS 52): FAS 52 is used to determine the timing of the recognition of income or expense resulting from foreign exchange rate changes for transactions denominated in other than a functional currency. AIG has determined that, in certain cases, its application of FAS 52 in its consolidated financial statements did not comply with the functional currency determination requirements of the standard. As a result, AIG has recorded accounting adjustments to reclassify currency transaction gains and losses from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income. These corrections affected consolidated net income in certain periods but had no effect on consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2004 or for prior periods. AIG adopted a practice in the 1990s of recording adjustments to general insurance reserves to offset increases or decreases in such reserves through other comprehensive income, net of tax, resulting from translation of reserves denominated in foreign currencies. AIG now believes that this accounting practice was a misapplication of GAAP. As a result of this adjustment, general insurance reserves denominated in foreign currencies have been restated to restore the translation effect to reserve for losses and loss expenses. FORM 10-K : 39\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nTogether, these adjustments had the following effects on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts:\\n-\\nLife Settlements. Life settlements are designed to assist life insurance policyholders to monetize the existing value of life insurance policies. AIG, through an insurance subsidiary and non-consolidated trusts, which are deemed to be a qualifying special purpose entity and a VIE, engages in this business. The non-consolidated trusts purchase life insurance policies from policyholders at an initial price and pay additional premiums to keep the policies in force until the insured dies. AIG’s proportionate share of the net death benefits from the purchased contracts, net of reinsurance to a third party reinsurer, was recorded as premium. The costs incurred by the trusts to acquire the contracts and keep them in force were recorded as paid losses by AIG, net of reinsurance. AIG’s accounting resulted in upfront gain recognition of expected profits and premium recognition for amounts loaned to the trusts by other AIG subsidiaries. AIG has determined, in light of new information which was not available to management or AIG’s independent auditors at the time the initial accounting determination was made, that the accounting for these transactions as insurance and reinsurance is a misapplication of GAAP that should be corrected through restatement. This restatement results in life settlements being accounted for using an investment method of accounting under FASB Technical Bulletin (FTB) 85-4 “Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance.” Under FTB 85-4, the carrying value of each contract at purchase and at the end of each reporting period is equal to the cash surrender value of the contract. Cash paid to purchase these contracts that is in excess of the cash surrender value at the date of purchase is recognized as a loss immediately, and periodic maintenance costs, such as premiums necessary to keep the underlying contract in force, are charged to earnings immediately. The life insurance benefits at the insured’s death are payable to the AIG subsidiary and reflected in income at that time. The effect of the adjustments and restatement on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts is as follows. Recently, the FASB tentatively concluded that life settlement contracts should be accounted for as an investment, held at cost, with no loss recognized at inception, and revenue recognized when the death benefit is received. In its discussions, the FASB tentatively concluded that retroactive application will be required. AIG expects that approximately $250 million of the restatement adjustment to shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2004 would be eliminated if the FASB’s tentative conclusion is adopted. -\\nDeferred Acquisition Costs (DAC): The internal review identified a misapplication of GAAP with respect to General Insurance DAC. As a result of “top level” entries, substantially all costs associated with underwriting and marketing operations were deferred. The internal review determined that certain of these costs did not vary sufficiently with the production of business and should not have been deferred. These costs have been allocated to the periods in which they were incurred and the corresponding DAC asset has been adjusted accordingly. In addition, AIG determined that the amortization period for certain DAC was longer than the typical life of the underlying policies and needed to be shortened, and that certain deferrals associated with an inter-company reinsurance treaty were in error and required correction. This adjustment includes the recharacterization of certain incurred policy losses and benefits to Insurance acquisition and other operating expenses. The effect of\\n40 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nthese adjustments on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts is as follows:\\n-\\nSICO Deferred Compensation: AIG has included in this restatement, expense amounts attributable to deferred compensation granted to certain AIG employees by SICO (pursuant to the SICO Plan described under Item 11. Executive Compensation), a private holding company that owns approximately 12 percent of AIG’s common stock. The amount of deferred compensation granted by SICO has previously been disclosed in the notes to AIG’s consolidated financial statements but was not included as an expense in the calculation of AIG’s consolidated net income because the amounts had been determined not to be material to AIG’s consolidated results of operations in any individual period. The expense related to SICO deferred compensation is recorded as a charge to reported earnings in the periods restated, with an offsetting entry to additional paid-in capital reflecting amounts deemed contributed by SICO. For prior periods, AIG has recorded a reduction of $905 million in retained earnings on its December 31, 1999 consolidated balance sheet and a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital. The volatility in the expense is attributable to the variable accounting as well as the fact that shares are allocated only in alternate years. The inclusion of the expense attributable to the SICO Plans in AIG’s consolidated financial statements had no effect on consolidated shareholders’ equity but had the following effects on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income accounts:\\n-\\nCommutations: Certain direct insurance, and ceded and assumed reinsurance contracts, were commuted prior to their natural expiration. For certain commutations, the cash received was recorded through negative paid losses in accordance with statutory guidance, while for others it was recorded as written premiums. Despite the lack of guidance under GAAP with respect to this issue, AIG has determined that the accounting for certain commutations was in error due to the inconsistency in AIG’s accounting for commutations and the fact that certain commutations were recorded through the written premium line when there was no unearned premium balance outstanding. As part of this restatement any commutations that were originally recorded through written premium are reclassified to paid losses in the period in which they occurred. The adjustments and restatement have no effect on consolidated net income or shareholders’ equity but affected certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts as follows:\\n-\\nDollar Roll Transactions: Certain AIG subsidiaries entered into dollar roll transactions with third parties designed to enhance the return on AIG’s mortgage backed securities (MBS) portfolio. In a dollar roll transaction, AIG subsidiaries agree to sell a pool of MBSs and simultaneously agree to repurchase substantially the same securities at a later date, typically in one month. AIG accounted for these transactions as collateralized financings under SFAS 140. Even though it had received collateral sufficient to fund substantially all of the cost of purchasing identical replacement securities at the time of transfer, AIG was not fully protected during the term of the contract to replace the asset in the event that the transferee defaulted. Accordingly, AIG should not have accounted for these transactions as financings, but rather as derivatives with mark-to-market changes reflected in earnings. The effect of the adjustments and re-\\nFORM 10-K : 41\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nstatement on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income accounts is as follows:\\n-\\nAffordable Housing: Through an investment limited partnership, an AIG subsidiary, as the general partner, syndicates the tax benefits (including both tax credits and tax losses) generated by affordable housing real estate properties. AIG guarantees the return of the tax benefits to the limited partner investors. Prior to the second quarter of 2003, these syndication transactions were accounted for as sales and the gain was recorded on a straight-line basis over ten years. Beginning in the third quarter of 2003, because of the guarantees, AIG changed its accounting for these partnerships to record all new syndications as financings, rather than sales. At the same time, AIG adjusted its consolidated balance sheet to reflect previous syndications as financings, but did not record the cumulative impact to earnings because the amounts were viewed as immaterial. AIG has now determined that it is necessary to record these adjustments for the periods prior to the third quarter of 2003, and the adjustments and restatement had the following effects on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts:\\n-\\nSunAmerica Partnerships: As part of the restatement, management has reclassified the earnings of the SunAmerica partnerships out of other operations, where previously reported, into the Asset Management segment. This revised presentation characterizes the partnership earnings as revenues rather than as a component of insurance acquisition and operating expenses in AIG’s consolidated statement of income. Within the Asset Management segment, this presentation divides the partnership earnings into those of SunAmerica Life, whose equity supports the GIC business, and those of AIG SunAmerica, which are now classified as other asset management revenues. The adjustments and restatement have no effect on consolidated net income or shareholders’ equity but affected certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income accounts as follows:\\nFourth Quarter 2004 Changes in Estimates\\nAdjustments affecting the 2004 consolidated statement of income include changes in estimates relating to the reserve for losses and loss expenses, certain expenses and certain allowances. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” herein. Losses and loss expenses incurred for the fourth quarter includes $850 million relating to changes in estimates attributable to asbestos and environmental exposures, see “Asbestos and Environmental Reserve” herein, $232 million relating to changes in estimates attributable to the accruals for salvage and subrogation recoveries (see Note 1(cc) of Notes to Financial Statements) and $178 million attributable to an arbitration decision with Superior National Insurance Company over the rescission of a quota share reinsurance agreement, which increases the reserves for the matter to $370 million at December 31, 2004. See Note 12(h) of Notes to Financial Statements. The changes in estimates also includes an adjustment of $56 million to deferred acquisition costs, principally relating to a refinement of costs eligible for deferral in accordance with AIG policy. The change in estimate for DBG asset realization includes an increase in the allowance for uncollectible receivables. With respect to income taxes, the change in estimate relates primarily from the determination that the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries are expected to be repatriated to the U.S. Accordingly, AIG can no longer assert that the undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested. See Note 1(cc) of Notes to Financial Statements for further details on fourth quarter changes in estimates.'),\n",

Beginning with the first quarter of 2004, AIG reports Retirement Services results in the same segment as Life Insurance, reflecting the convergence of protective financial and retirement products and AIG’s current management of these operations. All financial information herein gives effect to the restatement and adjustments for changes in estimates described in “Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements” and “Fourth Quarter 2004 Changes in Estimates” herein. Information for years prior to 2004 included herein has been reclassified to show AIG’s results of operations and financial position on a comparable basis with the 2004 presentation. Through these segments, AIG provides insurance and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions. This geographic, product and service diversification is one of AIG’s major strengths and sets it apart from its competitors. The importance of this diversification was especially evident in 2004, when record catastrophe losses in certain insurance operations were more than offset by profitability in those operations as well as in other segments and product lines. Although regional economic downturns or political upheaval could negatively affect parts of AIG’s operations, AIG believes that its diversification makes it unlikely that regional difficulties would have a material effect on its operating results, financial condition or liquidity. AIG’s subsidiaries serve commercial, institutional and individual customers through an extensive property-casualty and life insurance and retirement services network. In the United States, AIG companies are the largest underwriters of commercial and industrial insurance and one of the largest life insurance and retirement services operations as well. AIG’s Financial Services businesses include commercial aircraft and equipment leasing, capital markets operations and consumer finance, both in the United States and abroad. AIG also provides asset management services and offers guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) to institutions and individuals. AIG’s 2004 operating performance reflects implementation of various long-term strategies and defined goals in its various operating segments. A primary goal of AIG in managing its General Insurance operations is to achieve an underwriting profit. To achieve this goal, AIG is disciplined in its risk selection and premiums must be adequate and terms and conditions appropriate to cover the risk accepted. AIG believes in strict control of expenses. Another central focus of AIG operations in current years is the development and expansion of new distribution channels. In 2004, AIG expanded its distribution channels in many Asian countries, which now include banks, credit card companies and television-media home shopping. In late 2003, AIG entered into an agreement with PICC Property and Casualty Company, Limited (PICC), which will enable the marketing of accident and health products throughout China through PICC’s branch networks and agency system. AIG participates in the underwriting results through a reinsurance agreement and also holds a 9.9 percent ownership interest in PICC. Other examples of new distribution channels used both domestically and overseas include banks, affinity groups, direct response and e-commerce. AIG patiently builds relationships in markets around the world where it sees long-term growth opportunities. For example, the fact that AIG has the only wholly-owned foreign life insurance operations in eight cities in China is the result of relationships developed over nearly 30 years. AIG’s more recent extensions of operations into India, Vietnam, Russia and other emerging markets reflect the same growth strategy. Moreover, AIG believes in investing in the economies and infrastructures of these countries and growing with them. When AIG companies enter a new jurisdiction, they typically offer both basic protection and savings products. As the economies evolve, AIG’s products evolve with them, to more complex and investment-oriented models. Growth for AIG may be generated both internally and through acquisitions which both fulfill strategic goals and offer adequate return on investment. In recent years, the acquisitions of AIG Star Life and AIG Edison Life have broadened AIG’s penetration of the Japanese market through new distribution channels and will result in operating efficiencies as they are integrated into AIG’s previously existing companies operating in Japan. AIG provides leadership on issues of concern to the global and local economies as well as the insurance and financial services industries. In recent years, efforts to reform the tort system and class action litigation procedures, legislation to deal with the asbestos problem and the renewal of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act have been key issues, while in prior years trade legislation and Superfund had been issues of concern. FORM 10-K : 53\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nThe following table summarizes AIG’s revenues, income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes and net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:\\nConsolidated Results\\nThe 23.3 percent growth in revenues in 2004 was primarily attributable to the growth in net premiums earned from global General Insurance operations as well as growth in both General Insurance and Life Insurance & Retirement Services net investment income and Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums. An additional factor was the decline in aggregate realized capital losses in 2004 compared to 2003. The decline in realized capital losses in 2004 reflects an improved economy, stronger corporate balance sheets and a significantly lower level of impairment loss provisions. The realized capital losses in 2003 reflect primarily impairment loss provisions. Upon the ultimate disposition of these holdings, a portion of these losses may be recovered depending on future market conditions. AIG’s income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes increased 28.3 percent in 2004 when compared to 2003. Life Insurance & Retirement Services, Financial Services and Asset Management operating income gains, together with the decrease in realized capital losses, generated the increase over 2003 in both pretax income and net income. The following table summarizes the net effect of catastrophe losses for December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. *\\nIncludes $96 million in catastrophe losses from partially owned companies.

In addition, General Insurance operations generated realized capital gains of $220 million in 2004 compared to realized capital losses of $62 million in 2003.

Foreign operations provide over 60 percent of AIG’s Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income. Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income increased by 24.7 percent in 2004. This increase resulted from growth in each of AIG’s principal Life Insurance & Retirement Services businesses, and the capital gains realized in 2004 rather than the capital losses realized in 2003. Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income also grew in 2003 relative to 2002 by 22.6 percent. Financial Services\\nAIG’s Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified financial products and services including aircraft leasing, capital market transactions, consumer finance and insurance premium financing. Financial Services operating income increased in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to the fluctuation in earnings resulting from derivative activities that did not quality for hedge accounting under FAS 133. Offsetting this increase is the reduced income from Capital Markets operations and the effect of ILFC’s disposition of approximately $2 billion in aircraft through securitizations in the third quarter of 2003 and first quarter of 2004. Fluctuations in revenues and operating income from quarter to quarter are not unusual because of the transaction-oriented nature of Capital Markets operations and the effect of the FAS 133 adjustments. The charge relating to the PNC settlement, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings, also had a significant negative effect on results.'),\n",

These products and services are offered to individuals and institutions, both domestically and overseas. Asset Management operating income increased 66.0 percent in 2004 when compared to 2003 as a result of the upturn in worldwide financial markets and a strong global product portfolio; operating income also increased in 2003 when compared to 2002. Capital Resources\\nAt December 31, 2004, AIG had total consolidated shareholders’ equity of $80.61 billion and total borrowings of $95.26 billion. At that date, $85.28 billion of such borrowings were either not guaranteed by AIG or were matched borrowings under obligations of guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs) or matched notes and bonds payable. During 2004, AIG repurchased in the open market 16,299,300 shares of its common stock.

Consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in 2004 amounted to $35.58 billion. AIG believes that its liquid assets, cash provided by operations and access to short term funding through commercial paper and bank credit facilities will enable it to meet any anticipated cash requirements. Outlook\\nFrom March through May of 2005, the major rating agencies downgraded AIG’s ratings in a series of actions. S&P lowered the long-term senior debt and counterparty ratings of AIG from ‘AAA’ to ‘AA+’ and placed the ratings on Credit Watch Negative. Moody’s lowered AIG’s long-term senior debt rating from ‘Aaa’ to ‘Aa2’ and placed the ratings on review for possible downgrade. Fitch downgraded the long-term senior debt ratings of AIG from ‘AAA’ to ‘AA’ and placed the ratings on Ratings Watch Negative. The agencies also took rating actions on AIG’s insurance subsidiaries. S&P and Fitch lowered to ‘AA+’ the insurance financial strength ratings of most of AIG’s insurance companies. Moody’s lowered the insurance financial strength ratings generally to either ‘Aa1’ or ‘Aa2’. A.M. Best downgraded the financial strength ratings for most of AIG’s insurance subsidiaries from ‘A++’ to ‘A+’ and the issuer credit ratings from ‘aa+’ to ‘aa-’. The insurance companies’ ratings remain on a negative watch. In addition, S&P placed ILFC’s ‘AA-’ long-term senior debt rating and ‘A-1+’ short-term rating on Credit Watch Negative. Moody’s affirmed ILFC’s long-term and short-term senior debt ratings (‘A1’/‘P-1’). Fitch downgraded ILFC’s long-term senior debt rating from ‘AA-’ to ‘A+’ and placed the rating on Rating Watch Negative and downgraded ILFC’s short-term debt rating from ‘F1+’ to ‘F1’. Fitch also placed the ‘A+’ long-term senior debt ratings of American General Finance Corporation and American General Finance, Inc. on Rating Watch Negative. S&P and Moody’s affirmed the long-term and short-term senior debt ratings of American General Finance Corporation at ‘A+’/‘A-1’ and ‘A1’/‘P-1’, respectively. These debt and financial strength ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. As such, they may be changed,\\nFORM 10-K : 55\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nsuspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at AIG management’s request. This discussion of ratings is not a complete list of ratings of AIG and its subsidiaries. For a discussion of the effect of these ratings downgrades on AIG’s businesses, see “Certain Factors Affecting AIG’s Business - AIG’s Credit Ratings” in Item 1. Business. Despite industry price erosion in some classes of general insurance, AIG expects to continue to identify profitable opportunities and build attractive new General Insurance businesses as a result of AIG’s broad product line and extensive distribution networks. AIG expects total General Insurance premiums to increase for 2005 and expects cash flow for investments to remain strong. Thus, General Insurance net investment income is expected to rise in future quarters even in a continued low interest rate environment. In China, AIG has wholly-owned life insurance operations in eight cities. These operations should benefit from China’s rapid rate of economic growth and growing middle class, a segment that is a prime market for life insurance. AIG believes that it may also have opportunities in the future to grow by entering the group insurance business. However, in March 2005 it withdrew its application to serve the group insurance market until certain regulatory issues are resolved. Among the regulatory issues to be addressed is the response to AIG’s acknowledgment that certain of its Hong Kong based agents sold life insurance to customers on the Chinese mainland in contravention of applicable regulations. AIG Edison Life, acquired in August 2003, adds to the current agency force in Japan, and provides alternative distribution channels including banks, financial advisers, and corporate and government employee relationships. AIG Edison Life’s integration into AIG’s existing Japanese operations will provide future operating efficiencies. In January 2005, AIG Star Life entered into an agreement with the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, one of Japan’s largest banks, to market a multi-currency fixed annuity. Through ALICO, AIG Star Life and AIG Edison, AIG has developed a leadership position in the distribution of annuities through banks. AIG is also a leader in the direct marketing of insurance products through sponsors and in the broad market. AIG also expects continued growth in India, Korea and Vietnam. Domestically, AIG anticipates continued operating growth in 2005 as distribution channels are expanded and new products are introduced. The home service operation has not met business objectives, although its cash flow has been strong, and domestic group life/health was also weak in 2004. AIG expects restructuring efforts in these businesses to show positive results by early 2006. AIG American General’s current ratings remain equal to or higher than many of its principal competitors. In addition, recent events have caused independent producers and distributors of AIG American General’s products to be more cautious in placing business with AIG. Therefore, AIG is unable to predict the effect of these issues on AIG’s business, including any increase in associated surrender or replacement activity. In the airline industry, changes in market conditions are not immediately apparent in operating results. Lease rates have firmed considerably, as a result of strong demand spurred by the recovering global commercial aviation market, especially in Asia. Sales have begun to increase, and AIG expects an increasing level of interest from a variety of purchasers. Therefore, AIG believes that the improvements in that market which commenced in 2003 will be gradually reflected in ILFC’s results in 2005. In the Capital Markets operations, the integration of AIG Trading Group Inc. and its subsidiaries into the operations of AIG Financial Products Corp. and its subsidiaries created operating efficiencies that will continue to be realized and product synergies that should enhance 2005 results, although quarter to quarter variations are to be expected in this transaction-oriented business. AIG also expects increased contributions to Financial Services revenues and income from its consumer finance operations both domestically and overseas. However, the downgrades of AIG’s credit ratings may adversely affect funding costs for AIG and its subsidiaries and AIGFP’s ability to engage in derivative transactions and certain structured products.

These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, AIG’s results of operations would be directly affected. Throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, AIG’s critical accounting estimates are discussed in detail. The major categories for which assumptions are developed and used to establish each critical accounting estimate are highlighted below. Reserves for Losses and Loss Expenses (General Insurance):\\n•\\nLoss trend factors: used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on premium rate adequacy and the projected loss ratio with respect to prior accident years. •\\nExpected loss ratios for the latest accident year: in this case, accident year 2004 for the year end 2004 loss reserve analysis. For low-frequency, high-severity classes such as excess casualty and directors and officers liability (D&O), expected loss ratios generally are utilized for at least the three most recent accident years. •\\nLoss development factors: used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate amount. Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and Health Contracts (Life Insurance & Retirement Services):\\n•\\nInterest rates: which vary by geographical region, year of issuance and products. •\\nMortality, morbidity and surrender rates: based upon actual experience by geographical region modified to allow for variation in policy form.

Operating Review\\nGeneral Insurance Operations\\nAIG’s General Insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance both domestically and abroad. See “General Insurance Operations” in Item 1. Business for more information relating to General Insurance subsidiaries. As previously noted, AIG believes it should present and discuss its financial information in a manner most meaningful to its investors. Accordingly, in its General Insurance business, AIG uses certain non-GAAP measures, where AIG has determined these measurements to be useful and meaningful. A critical discipline of a successful general insurance business is the objective to produce operating income from underwriting exclusive of investment-related income. When underwriting is not profitable, premiums are inadequate to pay for insured losses and underwriting related expenses. In these situations, the addition of general insurance related investment income and realized capital gains may, however,\\nFORM 10-K : 57\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nenable a general insurance business to produce operating income. For these reasons, AIG views underwriting profit to be critical in the overall evaluation of performance. Although in and of itself not a GAAP measurement, AIG believes that underwriting profit is a useful and meaningful disclosure. See also the discussion under “Liquidity” herein. Underwriting profit is measured in two ways: statutory underwriting profit and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) underwriting profit. Statutory underwriting profit is derived by reducing net premiums earned by net losses and loss expenses incurred and net expenses incurred. Statutory accounting generally requires immediate expense recognition and ignores the matching of revenues and expenses as required by GAAP. That is, for statutory purposes, expenses are recognized immediately, not over the same period that the revenues are earned. A basic premise of GAAP accounting is the recognition of expenses at the same time revenues are earned, the accounting principle of matching. Therefore, to convert underwriting results to a GAAP basis, acquisition expenses are deferred (deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC)) and amortized over the period the related net premiums written are earned. Accordingly, the statutory underwriting profit has been adjusted as a result of acquisition expenses being deferred as required by GAAP. DAC is reviewed for recoverability, and such review requires management judgment.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'doc_id': '5272_2004.htm#section_7::chunk18', 'section_id': '5272_2004.htm#section_7', 'section': 'section_7', 'section_title': 'ITEM 7.', 'filename': '5272_2004.htm', 'cik': '0000005272', 'year': 2004, 'chunk_index': 18}, page_content='See also “Critical Accounting Estimates” herein and Notes 1, 2 and 4 of Notes to Financial Statements. AIG, along with most General Insurance companies, uses the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. The loss ratio is the sum of losses and loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is statutory underwriting expenses divided by net premiums written. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned or written, the cost of losses and statutory expenses, respectively. The combined ratio presents the total cost per $100 of premium production. A combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit; a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting loss. Net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies. The net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period. Thus, the net unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized in income as net premiums earned until the end of the policy period. The underwriting environment varies from country to country, as does the degree of litigation activity. Regulation, product type and competition have a direct effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting profit and statutory general insurance ratios. 58 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nGeneral Insurance operating income is comprised of underwriting profit (loss), net investment income and realized capital gains and losses. These components, as well as net premiums written, net premiums earned and statutory ratios for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows:\\n(a)\\nCatastrophe losses for 2004 by reporting unit were: DBG $582 million, Personal Lines $25 million, Transatlantic $215 million and Foreign General $232 million. Catastrophe losses for 2003 by reporting unit were: DBG $48 million, Personal Lines $5 million, Transatlantic $4 million and Foreign General $26 million.

(g)\\nThe effect of the asbestos and environmental charge on the loss ratio was an increase of 2.21 in 2004. The effect of catastrophe losses on the loss ratio was an increase of 2.74 in 2004 and 0.26 in both 2003 and 2002. The effect of the loss reserve charge on the loss ratio was an increase of an additional 8.91 in 2002. General Insurance Results\\nGeneral Insurance operating income in 2004 showed positive results, even after accounting for catastrophe losses and the charge for asbestos and environmental exposures. Net investment income and the capital gains realized in 2004 rather than the capital losses realized in 2003 and 2002 also benefitted General Insurance results. Like most AIG units, DBG benefited in 2004 from the flight to quality, a strong profit center focus and growing distribution channels. Overall, DBG’s net premiums written increased in 2004 and 2003. Domestic property-casualty rates are generally satisfactory at this time, although in some classes of business, including property, D&O and energy, rates should be firmer. The underwriting loss in 2004 resulted from the fourth quarter charge attributable to the change in estimate for asbestos and environmental reserves and catastrophe losses. Lexington, the largest excess and surplus lines carrier and a major underwriter of property insurance, was also significantly affected by catastrophe losses. Transatlantic’s net premiums written and net premiums earned increased as a result of growth in its international business. However, Transatlantic’s results were substantially affected by record catastrophes in the U.S. and around the world. Net premiums written in personal lines operations for 2004 and 2003 include $359 million and $159 million, respectively, from the domestic insurance operations of GE that were acquired in August 2003. The increase in net premiums written apart from this acquisition resulted from increased marketing efforts as well as rate increases in several states. The underwriting profit in 2003 resulted from premium rate increases and growth in net premiums written and earned. Underwriting profits are expected to continue to improve in 2005 as a result of continued marketing efforts and loss cost stabilization. FORM 10-K : 59\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nNet premiums written by Mortgage Guaranty operations increased 14.2 percent in 2004 over 2003.

In Japan, corporate and personal accident business expanded. Commercial lines in Europe continue to exhibit strong growth, as did personal lines operations in Brazil and Latin America. Additionally, AIG’s joint venture in India has expanded its commercial lines leadership among the private sector companies. AIG transacts business in most major foreign currencies. The following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the growth of General Insurance net premiums written. AIG’s General Insurance results reflect the net effect on incurred losses from catastrophes of $1.05 billion, $83 million and $61 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The effect on losses caused by catastrophes can fluctuate widely from year to year, making comparisons of recurring type business more difficult. With respect to catastrophe losses, AIG believes that it has taken appropriate steps, such as careful exposure selection and obtaining reinsurance coverage, to reduce the effect of the magnitude of possible future losses. The occurrence of one or more catastrophic events of unanticipated frequency or severity, such as a terrorist attack, earthquake or hurricane, that causes insured losses, however, could have a material adverse effect on AIG’s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. General Insurance net investment income grew in 2004 when compared to 2003. AIG is benefiting from strong cash flow as well as increased partnership income. In 2003, net investment income increased slightly when compared to 2002. As AIG believes that net premiums written will continue to increase in 2005, AIG expects that cash flow for investment will continue to be strong, resulting in growth in net investment income in 2005. See also the discussion under “Liquidity” herein and Note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements. Realized capital gains and losses resulted from the ongoing investment management of the General Insurance portfolios within the overall objectives of the General Insurance operations. The realized capital gains in 2004 reflect an improved economy and stronger corporate balance sheets with significantly fewer impairments. Realized capital losses in 2003 and 2002 were reflective of weakness in the equity markets in early 2003 and prior periods and impairment loss provisions for both equity and fixed income holdings in all three years. See the discussion on “Valuation of Invested Assets” herein. The contribution of General Insurance operating income to AIG’s consolidated income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes was 21.7 percent in 2004, compared to 38.9 percent in 2003 and 13.0 percent in 2002. The decrease in contribution percentage in 2004 was largely the result of the effects of catastrophe losses and the fourth quarter charge for asbestos and environmental exposures, while the increase of 2003 over 2002 reflected the $2.1 billion loss reserve charge in 2002. In 2002, AIG’s General Insurance results reflect the net effect of the loss reserve charge of $2.1 billion with respect to accident years 1997 through 2001. Such charge was the result of AIG’s annual year-end review of General Insurance loss reserves. On a gross basis, incurred losses included $2.8 billion attributable to the loss reserve charge. Reinsurance\\nAIG is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its General Insurance operations. AIG insures risks globally, and its reinsurance programs must be coordinated in order to provide AIG the level of reinsurance protection that AIG desires. Reinsurance is an important risk management tool to manage transaction and insurance line risk retention at prudent levels set by management. AIG also purchases reinsurance to mitigate its catastrophic exposure. AIG is cognizant of the need to exercise good judgment in the selection and approval of both domestic and foreign companies participating in its reinsurance programs because one or more catastrophe losses could negatively affect AIG’s reinsurers and result in an inability of AIG to collect reinsurance recoverables. AIG’s reinsurance department evaluates catastrophic events and assesses the probability of occurrence and magnitude of catastrophic events through the use of state-of-the-art industry recognized program models among other techniques. AIG supplements these models through continually monitoring the risk exposure of AIG’s worldwide General Insurance operations and adjusting such models accordingly. While reinsurance arrangements\\n60 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\ndo not relieve AIG from its direct obligations to its insureds, an efficient and effective reinsurance program substantially limits AIG’s exposure to potentially significant losses. AIG’s consolidated general reinsurance assets amounted to $18.57 billion at December 31, 2004 and resulted from AIG’s reinsurance arrangements. Thus, a credit exposure existed at December 31, 2004 with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer may not be able to reimburse AIG under the terms of these reinsurance arrangements. AIG manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound, and when necessary AIG holds substantial collateral in the form of funds, securities and/or irrevocable letters of credit. This collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods on an individual reinsurer basis. At December 31, 2004, approximately 43 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from unauthorized reinsurers. In order to obtain statutory recognition, the majority of these balances were collateralized. The remaining 57 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from authorized reinsurers. The terms authorized and unauthorized pertain to regulatory categories, not creditworthiness. Approximately 90 percent of the balances with respect to authorized reinsurers are from reinsurers rated A (excellent) or better, as rated by A.M. Best, or A (strong) or better, as rated by Standard & Poor’s. These ratings are measures of financial strength. AIG maintains a reserve for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance, but it has been largely successful in its previous recovery efforts. At December 31, 2004, AIG had allowances for unrecoverable reinsurance approximating $400 million. At that date, AIG had no significant reinsurance recoverables due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled (e.g., liquidated, insolvent, in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction). AIG’s Reinsurance Security Department conducts ongoing detailed assessments of the reinsurance markets and current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic. Such assessments include, but are not limited to, identifying if a reinsurer is appropriately licensed and has sufficient financial capacity, and evaluating the local economic environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates. This department also reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the requirements for credit risk mitigants. For example, in AIG’s treaty reinsurance contracts, AIG includes provisions that frequently require a reinsurer to post collateral when a referenced event occurs. Furthermore, AIG limits its unsecured exposure to reinsurers through the use of credit triggers, which include, but are not limited to, insurer financial strength rating downgrades, policyholder surplus declines at or below a certain predetermined level or a certain predetermined level of a reinsurance recoverable being reached. In addition, AIG’s Credit Risk Committee reviews the credit limits for and concentrations with any one reinsurer. AIG enters into intercompany reinsurance transactions, primarily through AIRCO, for its General Insurance and Life Insurance operations. AIG enters into these transactions as a sound and prudent business practice in order to maintain underwriting control and spread insurance risk among AIG’s various legal entities. These reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. AIG generally obtains letters of credit in order to obtain statutory recognition of these intercompany reinsurance transactions. At December 31, 2004, approximately $3.3 billion of letters of credit were outstanding to cover intercompany reinsurance transactions with AIRCO or other General Insurance subsidiaries. At December 31, 2004, the consolidated general reinsurance assets of $18.57 billion include reinsurance recoverables for paid losses and loss expenses of $819 million and $14.62 billion with respect to the ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses, including ceded losses incurred but not reported (IBNR) (ceded reserves). The ceded reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate ceded losses including provisions for ceded IBNR and loss expenses. The methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting ceded reserves are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments thereto are reflected in income currently. It is AIG’s belief that the ceded reserves at December 31, 2004 were representative of the ultimate losses recoverable. In the future, as the ceded reserves continue to develop to ultimate amounts, the ultimate loss recoverable may be greater or less than the reserves currently ceded. FORM 10-K : 61\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nReserve for Losses and Loss Expenses\\nThe table below classifies as of December 31, 2004 the components of the General Insurance reserve for losses and loss expenses (loss reserves) with respect to major lines of business on a statutory basis*:\\n*\\nPresented pursuant to statutory reporting requirements as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including IBNR and loss expenses on a statutory accounting basis. At December 31, 2004, General Insurance net loss reserves increased $11.01 billion from the prior year end to $47.7 billion. The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance and the discount for future investment income. The table below classifies the components of the General Insurance net loss reserves by business unit as of December 31, 2004. (a)\\nDBG loss reserves include approximately $3.26 billion ($3.91 billion before discount) related to business written by DBG but ceded to AIRCO and reported in AIRCO’s statutory filings. DBG loss reserves also include approximately $3.02 billion and $263 million related to business ceded to Union Excess and Richmond, respectively, and are now included in AIG’s results as a result of insufficient risk transfer and the consolidation of these entities. (b)\\nPersonal Lines loss reserves include $668 million related to business ceded to DBG and reported in DBG’s statutory filings. (c)\\nForeign General loss reserves include approximately $1.77 billion related to business reported in DBG’s statutory filings. Foreign General loss reserves also include approximately $218 million and $19 million related to business ceded to Union Excess and Richmond, respectively, but now included in AIG’s results as a result of insufficient risk transfer and the consolidation of these entities. The DBG net loss reserve of $32.85 billion is comprised principally of the business of AIG subsidiaries participating in the American Home/ National Union pool (11 companies) and the surplus lines pool (Lexington, Starr Excess Liability Insurance Company and Landmark Insurance Company). Beginning in 1998, DBG ceded a quota share percentage of its other liability occurrence and products liability occurrence business to AIRCO. The quota share percentage ceded was 40 percent in 1998, 65 percent in 1999, 75 percent in 2000 and 2001, 50 percent in 2002 and 2003 and 40 percent in 2004 and covered all business written in these years for these lines by participants in the American Home/National Union pool. In 1998 the cession reflected only the other liability occurrence business, but in 1999 and subsequent years included products liability occurrence. AIRCO’s loss reserves relating to these quota share cessions from DBG are recorded on a discounted basis. As of year-end 2004, AIRCO carried a discount of approximately $651 million applicable to the $3.91 billion in undiscounted reserves it assumed from the American Home/National Union pool via this quota share cession. AIRCO also carries approximately $368 million in net loss reserves relating to Foreign General insurance business. These reserves are carried on an undiscounted basis. Beginning in 1997, the Personal Lines division ceded a percentage of all business written by the companies participating in the personal lines pool to the American Home/National Union pool. As noted above, the total reserves carried by participants in the American Home/National Union pool relating to this cession amounted to $668 million as of year-end 2004. The companies participating in the American Home/ National Union pool have maintained a participation in the business written by AIU for decades. As of year-end 2004, these AIU reserves carried by participants in the American Home/ National Union pool amounted to approximately $1.77 billion. The remaining Foreign General reserves are carried by AIUO, AIRCO, and other smaller AIG subsidiaries domiciled outside the United States. Statutory filings in the U.S. by AIG companies reflect all the business written by U.S. domiciled entities only, and therefore exclude business written by AIUO, AIRCO, and all other internationally domiciled subsidiaries. The total reserves carried at year-end 2004 by AIUO and AIRCO were approximately $3.21 billion and $3.65 billion, respectively. AIRCO’s $3.65 billion in total general insurance reserves consist of approximately $3.26 billion from business assumed from the American Home/National Union pool and an additional $368 million relating to Foreign General Insurance business. 62 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nAt December 31, 2004, AIG’s overall general insurance net loss reserves reflects a loss reserve discount of $1.55 billion, including tabular and non-tabular calculations.

It is management’s belief that the General Insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover all General Insurance net losses and loss expenses as at December 31, 2004. While AIG annually reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be no assurance that AIG’s ultimate loss reserves will not adversely develop and materially exceed AIG’s loss reserves as of December 31, 2004. In the opinion of management, such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves is not likely to have a material adverse effect on AIG’s consolidated financial position, although it could have a material adverse effect on AIG’s consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period. In a very broad sense, the General Insurance loss reserves can be categorized into two distinct groups. One group is long-tail casualty lines of business which include excess and umbrella liability, D&O, professional liability, medical malpractice, workers compensation, general liability, products liability, and related classes. The other group is short-tail lines of business consisting principally of property lines, personal lines and certain classes of casualty lines. For operations writing short-tail coverages, such as property coverages, the process of recording quarterly loss reserve changes is geared toward maintaining an appropriate reserve level for the outstanding exposure, rather than determining an expected loss ratio for current business. For example, the IBNR reserve required for a class of property business might be expected to approximate 20 percent of the latest year’s earned premiums, and this level of reserve would be maintained regardless of the loss ratio emerging in the current quarter. The 20 percent factor is adjusted to reflect changes in rate levels, loss reporting patterns, known exposures to large unreported losses, or other factors affecting the particular class of business. Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses (net losses) for long-tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the line and volume of the business involved. Experience in the more recent accident years of long-tail casualty lines shows limited statistical credibility in reported net losses because a relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims and expenses and an even smaller proportion would be net losses paid. Therefore, IBNR would constitute a relatively high proportion of net losses. AIG’s carried net long-tail loss reserves are tested using loss trend factors that AIG considers most appropriate for each class of business. A variety of actuarial methods and assumptions is normally employed to estimate net losses for long-tail casualty lines. These methods ordinarily involve the use of loss trend factors intended to reflect the estimated annual growth in loss costs from one accident year to the next. For the majority of long-tail casualty lines, net loss trend factors approximated five percent. Loss trend factors reflect many items including changes in claims handling, exposure and policy forms; current and future estimates of monetary inflation and social inflation and increases in litigation and awards. These factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss experience. Thus, many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the year to year growth in loss costs recognized. A number of actuarial assumptions are made in the review of reserves for each line of business. For longer tail lines\\nFORM 10-K : 63\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nof business, actuarial assumptions generally are made with respect to the following:\\n•\\nLoss trend factors which are used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on the projected loss ratio for prior accident years. •\\nExpected loss ratios for the latest accident year (i.e., accident year 2004 for the year end 2004 loss reserve analysis) and, in some cases, for accident years prior to the latest accident year. The expected loss ratio generally reflects the projected loss ratio from prior accident years, adjusted for the loss trend (see above) and the effect of rate changes and other quantifiable factors. For low-frequency, high-severity classes such as excess casualty and D&O, expected loss ratios generally are utilized for at least the three most recent accident years. •\\nLoss development factors which are used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate basis. AIG records quarterly changes in loss reserves for each of its many General Insurance profit centers. The overall change in AIG’s loss reserves is based on the sum of these profit center level changes. For most profit centers which write longer tail classes of casualty coverage, the process of recording quarterly loss reserve changes involves determining the estimated current loss ratio for each class of coverage. This loss ratio is multiplied by the current quarter’s net earned premium for that class of coverage to determine the quarter’s total estimated net incurred loss and loss expense. The change in loss reserves for the quarter for each class is thus the difference between the net incurred loss and loss expense, estimated as described above, and the net paid losses and loss expenses in the quarter. The process of determining the current loss ratio for each class or business segment begins in the profit centers in the latter part of the previous year. The loss ratios determined for each profit center are based on a variety of factors. These include, but are not limited to, the following considerations: prior accident year and policy year loss ratios; actual and anticipated rate changes; actual and anticipated changes in coverage, reinsurance, or mix of business; actual and anticipated changes in external factors affecting results, such as trends in loss costs or in the legal and claims environment. Each profit center’s loss ratio for the following year is subject to review by the profit center’s management, by actuarial and accounting staffs, and ultimately by senior management. At the close of each quarter, the assumptions underlying the loss ratios are reviewed to determine if the loss ratios based thereon remain appropriate. This process includes a review of the actual claims experience in the quarter, actual rate changes achieved, actual changes in coverage, reinsurance or mix of business, and changes in certain other factors that may affect the loss ratio. When this review suggests that the initially determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate, the loss ratio for current business would be changed to reflect the revised assumptions. A comprehensive annual loss reserve review is conducted in the fourth quarter of each year for each AIG General Insurance subsidiary. These reviews are conducted in full detail for each class or line of business for each subsidiary, and thus consist of literally hundreds of individual analyses. The purpose of these reviews is to confirm the reasonableness of the reserves carried by each of the individual subsidiaries, and thereby of AIG’s overall carried reserves. The reserve analysis for each business class is performed by the actuarial personnel who are most familiar with that class of business. In completing these detailed actuarial reserve analyses, the actuaries are required to make numerous assumptions, including for example the selection of loss development factors and loss cost trend factors. They are also required to determine and select the most appropriate actuarial method(s) to employ for each business class. Additionally, they must determine the appropriate segmentation of data or segments from which the adequacy of the reserves can be most accurately tested. In the course of these detailed reserve reviews for each business segment, a point estimate of the loss reserve is generally determined. The sum of these point estimates for each of the individual business classes for each subsidiary provides an overall actuarial point estimate of the loss reserve for that subsidiary. The overall actuarial point estimate is compared to the subsidiary’s carried loss reserve. If the carried reserve can be supported by actuarial methods and assumptions which are also believed to be reasonable, then the carried reserve would generally be considered reasonable and no adjustment would be considered. The ultimate process by which the actual carried reserves are determined considers not only the actuarial point estimate but a myriad of other factors. Other crucial internal and external factors considered include a qualitative assessment of inflation and other economic conditions in the United States and abroad, changes in the legal, regulatory, judicial and social environments, underlying policy pricing, terms and conditions, and claims handling. Loss reserve development can also be affected by commutations of assumed and ceded reinsurance agreements. With respect to the 2004 year-end actuarial loss reserve analysis for DBG, the actuaries continued to utilize the modified assumptions which gave additional weight to actual loss development from the more recent years, as identified during the 2002 and 2003 analysis, with appropriate adjustments to account for the additional year of loss experience which emerged in 2004. Although the actuaries continued to use actuarial assumptions that rely on expected loss ratios based on the\\n64 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nresults of prior accident years, the expected loss ratio assumptions used continue to give far greater weight to the more recent accident year experience than was the case in the prior year-end assumptions. For example, for the excess casualty lead umbrella class of business, 100 percent weight was given to the experience of accident years 1998-2001, with no weight given to the more favorable experience of accident years prior to 1998. AIG’s annual loss reserve review does not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates. Because a large portion of the loss reserves from AIG’s General Insurance business relates to long-tail casualty lines driven by severity rather than frequency of claims, such as excess casualty and D&O, developing a range around loss reserve estimates would not be meaningful. An estimate is calculated which AIG’s actuaries believe provides a reasonable estimate of the required reserve. This amount is then evaluated against actual carried reserves. There is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves, particularly for long-tail casualty classes of business such as excess casualty, when actual costs differ from the assumptions used to test the reserves. Such assumptions include those made for loss trend factors and loss development factors, as described earlier. Set forth below is a sensitivity analysis demonstrating the estimated effect on the loss reserve position of alternative loss trend or loss development factor assumptions as compared to those actually used to test the carried reserves. For the excess casualty class of business the assumed loss cost trend was five percent. Thus, in establishing the expected loss ratios for accident years 2002 through 2004, the loss costs from accident years 1998 through 2001 were trended by this five percent factor per annum. A five percent change in the assumed loss cost trend from each accident year to the next would cause approximately a $600 million change (either positively or negatively) to the net loss and loss expense reserve for this business. For the D&O and related management liability classes of business the assumed loss cost trend was four percent. Thus, in establishing the expected loss ratios for accident years 2002 through 2004, the loss costs from accident years 1997 through 2001 were trended by this four percent factor per annum. A five percent change in this assumed loss cost trend would cause approximately a $500 million change (either positively or negatively) to the net loss and loss expense reserve for such business. For healthcare liability business, including hospitals and other healthcare exposures, a five percent change in the assumed loss cost trend would cause approximately a $150 million change (either positively or negatively) to the loss and loss expense reserve for this business. Actual loss cost trends in the early 1990’s were negative for these classes, whereas in the late 1990’s loss costs trends ran well into the double digits for each of these three classes. The sharp increase in loss costs in the late 1990’s was thus much greater than the five percent changes cited above, and caused significant increases in the overall loss reserve needs for these classes. While changes in the loss cost trend assumptions can have a significant effect on the reserve needs for other smaller classes of liability business, the potential effect of these changes on AIG’s overall carried reserves would be much less than for the classes noted above. For the excess casualty class, if future loss development factors differed by five percent from those utilized in the year-end 2004 loss reserve review, there would be approximately a $450 million change (either positively or negatively) to the overall AIG loss reserve position. The comparable effect on the D&O and related management liability classes would be approximately $200 million (either positive or negative) if future loss development factors differed by five percent from those utilized in the year-end 2004 loss reserve review. For healthcare liability classes, the effect would be approximately $125 million (either positive or negative). For workers compensation reserves, the effect of a five percent deviation from the loss development factors utilized in the year-end 2004 reserve reviews would be approximately $750 million (either positive or negative). Because loss development factors for this class have shown less volatility than higher severity classes such as excess casualty, however, actual changes in loss development factors are expected to be less than five percent. There is some degree of volatility in loss development patterns for other longer tail liability classes as well. However, the potential effect on AIG’s reserves would be much less than for the classes cited above. The calculations of the effect of the five percent change in loss development factors are made by selecting the stage of accident year development where it is believed reasonable for such a deviation to occur. For example, for workers compensation, the $750 million amount is calculated by assuming that each of the most recent eight accident years develop five percent higher than estimated by the current loss development factors utilized in the reserve study, i.e. the factor 1.05 is multiplied by the incurred losses (including IBNR and loss expenses) for these accident years. AIG management believes that using a five percent change in the assumptions for loss cost trends and loss development factors provides a reasonable benchmark for a sensitivity analysis of the reserves of AIG’s most significant lines of general insurance business. For excess casualty business, both the loss cost trend and the loss development factor assumptions are critical.'),\n",

However, there can be no assurance that future loss development pat-\\nFORM 10-K : 65\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nterns will be the same as in the past. Moreover, as excess casualty is a long-tail class of business, any deviation in loss cost trends or in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. Thus, there is the potential for the reserves with respect to a number of accident years to be significantly affected by changes in the loss cost trends or loss development factors that were initially relied upon in setting the reserves. These changes in loss trends or loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic phenomena affecting claims. For example, during the lengthy periods during which losses develop for excess casualty, actual changes in loss costs from one accident year to the next have ranged from negative values to double-digit amounts. Thus, there is the potential for significant volatility in loss costs for excess casualty and, although five percent is considered a reasonable benchmark for sensitivity analysis for this business, there is the potential for variations far greater than this amount (either positive or negative). Likewise, in the judgment of AIG’s actuaries, five percent is considered an appropriate benchmark for sensitivity analysis with respect to the loss development factor assumptions used to test the reserves. It should be noted that the loss cost trend factor for excess casualty was reduced to five percent in the year-end 2004 loss reserve review compared to the 7.5 percent loss trend factor used in the 2003 review for excess casualty. This reduction was made by AIG’s actuaries in response to a significant favorable loss trend that had emerged from accident year 2000 to 2001. This favorable trend appears to be continuing in accident years 2002 and 2003, although these accident years are still immature. For D&O and related management liability classes of business, the loss cost trend assumption is critical. The loss development factor assumption is important but less critical than for excess casualty. As this coverage is written on a claims-made basis, claims for a given accident year are all reported within that year. Actual changes in loss costs from one accident year to the next in the 1990s ranged from double digit negative values for several accident years in the early 1990s to nearly 50 percent per year for the period from accident year 1996 to accident year 1999. Thus, there is the potential for extreme volatility in loss costs for this business and, although five percent is considered a reasonable benchmark for sensitivity analysis, there is the potential for variations far greater than this amount (either positive or negative). Five percent is also considered an appropriate benchmark for sensitivity analysis with respect to the loss development factor assumptions used to test the reserves for these classes. However, as noted above, the effect of such a deviation is less than that of a similar deviation in loss cost trends. It should be noted that the loss cost trend factor for D&O and related management liability classes was reduced to four percent in the year end 2004 loss reserve reviews compared to six percent in the 2003 review. This reduction was made by AIG’s actuaries in response to a relative stabilization in loss costs from accident year 1999 to 2001 following the period of sharp increases in loss costs through 1999. The stabilization in loss costs appears to be continuing in accident years 2002 and 2003, although these accident years are still immature. For healthcare liability classes, both the loss cost trend and the loss development factor assumptions are critical. The nature of the potential volatility would be analogous to that described above for the excess casualty business. However, AIG’s volume of business in the healthcare classes is much smaller than for excess casualty, hence the potential effect on AIG’s overall reserves is smaller for these classes than for excess casualty. AIG’s healthcare liability business includes both primary and excess exposures. For workers compensation, the loss development factor assumptions are important. Generally, AIG’s actual historical workers compensation loss development would be expected to provide a reasonably accurate predictor of future loss development. A five percent sensitivity indicator for workers compensation would thus be considered to be toward the high end of potential deviations for this class of business. AIG’s workers compensation reserves include a small portion relating to excess workers compensation coverage. The analysis applicable to excess casualty would apply to these reserves. However, the volume of such business is de minimis compared to the volume of excess casualty. The loss cost trend assumption for workers compensation is not believed to be material with respect to AIG’s loss reserves other than for that portion representing excess workers compensation. This is primarily because AIG’s actuaries are generally able to use loss development projections for all but the most recent accident year’s reserves, so there is limited need to rely on loss cost trend assumptions for workers’ compensation business. For casualty business other than the classes noted above, there is generally some potential for deviation in both the loss cost trend and loss development factor selections. However, the effect of such deviations would not be material when compared to the effect cited above for excess casualty and D&O. The comprehensive annual loss reserve review process results in an accumulation of point estimates for AIG’s General Insurance business. The loss reserve carried at year-end 2004 for AIG’s General Insurance business was approximately equal to the aggregate reserve indicated by the actuarial point estimates. This represents a relative improvement of approximately two percent from AIG’s position as of December 31,\\n66 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc.'),\n",

Asbestos and Environmental Reserves\\nThe estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability. The insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures. AIG continues to receive claims asserting injuries from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites, referred to collectively as environmental claims, and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. The vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained an absolute exclusion for pollution related damage and an absolute asbestos exclusion was also implemented. However, AIG currently underwrites environmental impairment liability insurance on a claims-made basis and has excluded such claims from the analysis herein. The majority of AIG’s exposures for asbestos and environmental claims are excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. Thus, the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity reserves. That is, litigation expenses are included within the limits of the liability AIG incurs. Individual significant claim liabilities, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case basis. Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a subjective process and reserves for asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated using conventional reserving techniques such as those that rely on historical accident year loss development factors. Significant factors which affect the trends that influence the asbestos and environmental claims estimation process are the inconsistent court resolutions and judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage. The current case law can be characterized as still evolving, and there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop in the near future. Additionally, the exposures for cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites involve issues such as allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and the government’s refusal to release parties. Due to this uncertainty, it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the same degree of reliability as with other types of claims. Such future development will be affected by the extent to which courts continue to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage, as they have in the past, as well as by the changes in Superfund and waste dump site coverage issues. If the asbestos and environmental reserves develop deficiently, such deficiency would have an adverse effect on AIG’s future results of operations. AIG does not discount asbestos and environmental reserves. With respect to known asbestos and environmental claims, AIG established over a decade ago specialized toxic tort and environmental claims units, which investigate and adjust all such asbestos and environmental claims. These units evaluate these asbestos and environmental claims utilizing a claim-by-claim approach that involves a detailed review of individual policy terms and exposures. Because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, AIG generally evaluates exposure on a policy-by-policy basis, considering a variety of factors such as known facts, current law, jurisdiction, policy language and other factors that are unique to each policy. Quantitative techniques have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including management judgment.'),\n",

In both the specialized and dedicated asbestos and environmental claims units, AIG actively manages and pursues early settlement with respect to these claims in an attempt to mitigate its exposure to the unpredictable development of these claims. AIG attempts to mitigate its known long-tail environmental exposures by utilizing a combination of proactive claim-handling techniques including policy buybacks, complete environmental releases, compromise settlements, and, where indicated, litigation. With respect to asbestos claims handling, AIG’s specialized claims staff operates to mitigate losses through proactive handling, supervision and resolution of asbestos cases. Thus, while AIG has resolved all claims with respect to miners and major manufacturers (Tier One), its claims staff continues to operate under the same proactive philosophy to resolve claims involving accounts with products containing asbestos (Tier Two), products containing small amounts of asbestos, companies in the distribution process, and parties with re-\\nFORM 10-K : 67\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nmote, ill defined involvement in asbestos (Tiers Three and Four). Through its commitment to appropriate staffing, training, and management oversight of asbestos cases, AIG mitigates to the extent possible its exposure to these claims. In order to evaluate the overall reasonableness of the asbestos and environmental reserves established using the claim-by-claim approach as described above, AIG uses two methods, the market share method and the frequency/ severity or report year method. The market share method produces indicated asbestos and environmental reserve needs by applying the appropriate AIG market share to estimated potential industry ultimate loss and loss expenses based on the latest estimates from A.M. Best and Tillinghast. The market share method is a series of tests. Six estimates of potential industry ultimate losses for asbestos and environmental claims are tested. Additionally, a second series of tests are performed, using estimated industry unpaid losses, instead of industry ultimate losses. The market share tests are also performed using estimates of AIG’s market share. The reason AIG’s market share is an estimate is that there are assumptions as to which years and classes of business the asbestos and environmental exposure applies. For example, commercial multiple peril business is included in the market share calculation in some, but not all, of the scenarios. AIG’s estimate of the carried net asbestos and environmental reserves were approximately $50 million greater than the mean indication of the outcomes of market share testing. However, the market share method does not give weight to AIG’s actual asbestos and environmental loss experience. The frequency/severity or report year approach, is also a series of tests which are performed separately for asbestos and for environmental exposures. For asbestos, these tests project the expected losses to be reported over the next twenty years, i.e. from 2005 through 2024, based on the actual losses reported through 2004 and the expected future loss emergence for these claims. Three scenarios are tested, with a series of assumptions ranging from more optimistic to more conservative. In the first scenario, all carried asbestos case reserves, as determined above using the claim-by-claim approach, are assumed to be within ten percent of their ultimate settlement value. The second scenario relies on an actuarial projection of report year developments for asbestos claims reported from 1993 to the present to estimate case reserve adequacy as of year-end 2004. The third scenario also relies on an actuarial projection of report year claims for asbestos, but reflects claims reported from 1989 to the present to estimate case reserve adequacy as of year-end 2004. As of year-end 2004, the results of the second and third scenarios varied significantly.'),\n",

These calculations are performed on losses gross of reinsurance. The IBNR (including a provision for development of reported claims) on a net basis is based on applying a factor reflecting the expected ratio of net losses to gross losses for future loss emergence.

Although AIG has been successful in collecting the vast majority of its reinsurance on asbestos and environmental claims, the greater the future losses and the longer the exposure persists, the greater the likelihood of increased problems in collecting reinsurance.

AIG is continuing to increase the size of the wholesaler organization as a measure to improve sales. The majority of the growth in Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums in Foreign Life operations was attributable to the life insurance, personal accident & health, and group products lines of business. Globally, AIG’s deep and diverse distribution, which includes bancassurance, worksite marketing, direct marketing, and strong agency organizations, provides a powerful platform for growth. This growth was most significant in Southeast Asia where AIG maintains significant market share established by its strong agency force, and in Japan, where AIG has benefited from a flight to quality and development of multiple distribution channels. In light of AIG’s recent credit rating downgrades, it is unclear whether this flight to quality will continue to benefit AIG. See “Certain Factors Affecting AIG’s Business - AIG’s Credit Ratings”, for a further discussion of the potential effect of the rating downgrades on AIG’s businesses. Also in Japan, AIG Edison Life is being integrated successfully into AIG’s life operations.

The Foreign Retirement Services business continues its\\n72 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nstrong growth based upon its success in Japan and Korea by expanding its extensive distribution network and leveraging AIG’s product expertise. AIG is introducing annuity products in new markets. In January 2005, AIG Star Life entered into an agreement with the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, one of Japan’s largest banks, to market a multi-currency fixed annuity. In China, where AIG has a 57 percent market share of the total 2004 premiums written by foreign life insurers, first year life insurance premiums increased 36.6 percent in 2004 over the prior year. In addition, AIG had very good results in Greece, Central Europe and Russia. Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations produced 78.0 percent, 76.1 percent and 75.0 percent of Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. AIG transacts business in most major foreign currencies. The following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the growth of Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums. Under U.S. GAAP, deposits and certain other considerations received under deferred annuity (variable and fixed) and universal life contracts are not included as GAAP premiums. If such amounts were to be included, the overall growth from 2004 over 2003 would be greater, due in part to large increases in foreign individual fixed annuities. The growth in net investment income in 2004 was attributable to both foreign and domestic invested new cash flow for investment. Additionally, net investment income was positively affected by the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income. Lastly, AIG’s adoption of Statement of Position 03-1, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts” (SOP 03-1), increased net investment income in 2004 over prior years. See also the discussion under “Liquidity” herein and Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements. Life Insurance & Retirement Services investment portfolios are managed within the overall objectives of the Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations. The decline in realized capital losses in 2004 reflects an improved economy, stronger corporate balance sheets and a significantly lower level of impairments. The realized capital losses in 2003 reflect impairment loss provisions for certain equity and fixed income holdings. See also the discussion on “Valuation of Invested Assets” herein. The contribution of Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income to AIG’s consolidated income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes amounted to 53.0 percent in 2004, compared to 54.5 percent in 2003 and 64.9 percent in 2002. The relative contribution percentage remained constant between years. The decrease in 2003 over 2002 was a result of the $2.1 billion loss reserve charge for General Insurance in 2002. Underwriting and Investment Risk\\nThe risks associated with the life and accident and health products are underwriting risk and investment risk. The risk associated with the financial and investment contract products is primarily investment risk. Underwriting risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the actual policy experience adversely emerging in comparison to the assumptions made in the product pricing associated with mortality, morbidity, termination and expenses. The emergence of significant adverse experience would require an adjustment to DAC and benefit reserves that could have a substantial effect on AIG’s results of operations. AIG’s Foreign Life companies generally limit their maximum underwriting exposure on life insurance of a single life to approximately $1.7 million of coverage, and AIG’s Domestic Life companies generally limit their maximum underwriting exposure on life insurance of a single life to $5 million of coverage by using yearly renewable term reinsurance. See the discussion under “Liquidity” herein and Note 6 of Notes to Financial Statements. AIRCO acts primarily as an internal reinsurance company for AIG’s foreign life operations. This facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning locally (branch and subsidiary). It also allows AIG to pool its insurance risks and purchase reinsurance more efficiently at a consolidated level and manage global counterparty risk and relationships. AIG’s domestic Life Insurance and Retirement Services operations utilize internal and third-party reinsurance relationships to manage insurance risks and to facilitate capital management strategies. Pools of highly-rated third-party reinsurers are utilized to manage net amounts at risk in excess of retention limits. AIG’s domestic life insurance companies also cede excess, non-economic reserves carried on a statutory-basis only on certain term and universal life insurance policies and certain fixed annuities to AIG Life of Bermuda Ltd., a wholly owned Bermuda reinsurer. FORM 10-K : 73\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nAIG generally obtains letters of credit in order to obtain statutory recognition of these intercompany reinsurance transactions. For this purpose, AIG entered into a $2.5 billion syndicated letter of credit facility in December 2004. Letters of credit totaling $2.17 billion were outstanding as of December 31, 2004, and letters of credit for all $2.5 billion were outstanding as of March 31, 2005. The letter of credit facility has a ten-year term, but the facility can be reduced or terminated by the lenders beginning after seven years. The investment risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the cash flows from the invested assets, primarily long-term fixed rate investments, being less than the cash flows required to meet the obligations of the expected policy and contract liabilities and the necessary return on investments.'),\n",

To minimize its exposure to investment risk, AIG tests the cash flows from the invested assets and the policy and contract liabilities using various interest rate scenarios to assess whether there is a liquidity excess or deficit. If a necessary rebalancing of the invested assets to the policy and contract claims does not occur, a demand could be placed upon liquidity. See also the discussion under “Liquidity” herein. AIG actively manages the asset-liability relationship in its foreign operations, as it has been doing throughout AIG’s history, even though certain territories lack qualified long-term investments or certain local regulatory authorities may impose investment restrictions. For example, in Japan and several Southeast Asian countries, the duration of the investments is often for a shorter period than the effective maturity of the related policy liabilities. Therefore, there is a risk that the reinvestment of the proceeds at the maturity of the initial investments may be at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of the policy liabilities. Additionally, there exists a future investment risk associated with certain policies currently in force which will have premium receipts in the future. That is, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities. To maintain an adequate yield to match the interest necessary to support future policy liabilities, management focus is required to reinvest the proceeds of the maturing securities and to invest the future premium receipts while continuing to maintain satisfactory investment quality. Certain foreign jurisdictions, including Japan, have limited long-dated bond markets, and AIG may use alternative investments, including equities, real estate and foreign currency denominated fixed income instruments to extend the effective duration and increase the yield of the investment portfolio to more closely match the requirements of the policyholder liabilities and DAC recoverability, particularly in Taiwan, where Nan Shan has approximately 30 percent of invested assets in foreign currencies. Using foreign currency denominated investments to support policyholder liabilities could increase the risk to and volatility of cash flows and income. AIG actively manages this risk through regular monitoring and selected hedging strategies. AIG actively manages the asset-liability relationship in its domestic operations. This relationship is more easily managed through the ample supply of qualified long-term investments. AIG uses asset-liability matching as a management tool worldwide to determine the composition of the invested assets and appropriate marketing strategies. As a part of these strategies, AIG may determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position due to anticipated interest rate or other economic changes. In addition, the absence of long-dated fixed income instruments in certain markets may preclude a matched asset-liability position in those markets. A number of guaranteed benefits are offered on certain variable life and variable annuity products. See Note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting guidance for these benefits. DAC for life insurance and retirement services products arises from the deferral of those costs that vary with, and are directly related to, the acquisition of new or renewal business. Policy acquisition costs for life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period of the policy. Policy acquisition costs which relate to universal life and investment-type products, including variable and fixed annuities (investment-oriented products) are deferred and amortized, with interest, as appropriate, in relation to the historical and future incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts. With respect to universal life and investment-oriented products, AIG’s policy, as appropriate, has been to adjust amortization assumptions for DAC when estimates of current or future gross profits to be realized from these contracts are revised. With respect to variable annuities sold domestically (representing the vast majority of AIG’s variable annuity business), the assumption for the long-term annual net growth rate of the equity markets used in the determination of DAC amortization is approximately ten percent. A methodology referred to as “reversion to the mean” is used to maintain this long-term net growth rate assumption, while giving consideration to short-term variations in equity markets. Estimated gross profits include investment income and gains and losses on investments less interest required as well as other charges in the contract less actual mortality and expenses. Current experience and changes in the expected future gross profits are analyzed to determine the effect on the amortization of\\n74 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nDAC.

At December 31, 2004, approximately 20 percent of the foreign fixed income investments were either rated AAA or, on the basis of AIG’s internal analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities so rated. Approximately four percent were below investment grade or not rated at that date. A large portion of the foreign fixed income portfolio are sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting the policy liabilities in the country of issuance. Any fixed income security may be subject to downgrade for a variety of reasons subsequent to any balance sheet date. Valuation of Invested Assets\\nAIG has the ability to hold any fixed maturity security to its stated maturity, including those fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale.

In general, a security is considered a candidate for impairment if it meets any of the following criteria:\\n•\\nTrading at a significant (25 percent or more) discount to par, amortized cost (if lower) or cost for an extended period of time (nine months or longer);\\n•\\nThe occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in (i) the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation; or (ii) the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for the court supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprises; or (iii) the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value of their claims; or\\n•\\nIn the opinion of AIG’s management, it is possible that AIG may not realize a full recovery on its investment, irrespective of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events. Once a security has been identified as impaired, the amount of such impairment is determined by reference to that security’s contemporaneous market price and recorded as a charge to earnings. As a result of these policies, AIG recorded impairment losses net of taxes of approximately $369 million, $1.0 billion and $595 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The recovery in global equity and credit markets and reasonably steady domestic interest rates were the primary reasons for the decline in impairment loss recognition from 2003 to 2004. No impairment charge with respect to any one single credit was significant to AIG’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations, and no individual impairment loss exceeded 0.7 percent of consolidated net income for 2004. Excluding the impairments noted above, the changes in market value for AIG’s available for sale portfolio, which constitutes the vast majority of AIG’s investments, were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as unrealized gains or losses, net of tax. At December 31, 2004, the fair value of AIG’s fixed maturities and equity securities aggregated to $384.0 billion. At December 31, 2004, aggregate unrealized gains after taxes for fixed maturity and equity securities were $11.5 billion. At December 31, 2004, the aggregate unrealized losses after taxes of fixed maturity and equity securities were approximately $1.2 billion. The effect on net income of unrealized losses after taxes will be further mitigated upon realization, because certain realized losses will be charged to participating policyholder accounts, and realization will result in current decreases in the amortization of certain deferred policy acquisition costs. At December 31, 2004, unrealized losses for fixed maturity securities and equity securities did not reflect any significant industry concentrations. The amortized cost of fixed maturities available for sale in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2004, by contractual maturity, is shown below:\\nIn the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, the pretax realized losses incurred with respect to the sale of fixed maturities and equity securities were $1.8 billion. The aggregate fair value of securities sold was $31.7 billion, which was approximately 95 percent of amortized cost. The average period of time that securities sold at a loss during the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 were trading continuously at a price below book value was approximately four months. FORM 10-K : 77\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nAt December 31, 2004, aggregate pretax unrealized gains were $17.8 billion, while the pretax unrealized losses with respect to investment grade bonds, below investment grade bonds and equity securities were $1.3 billion, $284 million and $256 million, respectively. Aging of the pretax unrealized losses with respect to these securities, distributed as a percentage of cost relative to unrealized loss (the extent by which the market value is less than amortized cost or cost), including the number of respective items, was as follows:\\n(a)\\nFor bonds, represents amortized cost. (b)\\nAs more fully described above, upon realization, certain realized losses will be charged to participating policyholder accounts, or realization will result in a current decrease in the amortization of certain deferred policy acquisition costs. As stated previously, the valuation for AIG’s investment portfolio comes from market exchanges or dealer quotations, with the exception of nontraded securities. AIG considers nontraded securities to mean certain fixed income investments, certain structured securities, direct private equities, limited partnerships, and hedge funds. The aggregate carrying value of these securities at December 31, 2004 was approximately $65.0 billion, or approximately 13 percent of the portfolio. The methodology used to estimate fair value of nontraded fixed income investments is by reference to traded securities with similar attributes and using a matrix pricing methodology. This technique takes into account such factors as the industry, the security’s rating and tenor, its coupon rate, its position in the capital structure of the issuer, and other relevant factors. The change in fair value is recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. For certain structured securities, the carrying value is based on an estimate of the security’s future cash flows pursuant to the requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 99-20, “Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets.” The change in carrying value is recognized in income. Hedge funds and limited partnerships in which AIG holds in the aggregate less than a five percent interest are carried at fair value. The change in fair value is recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. With respect to hedge funds and limited partnerships in which AIG holds in the aggregate a five percent or greater interest, AIG uses the equity method to record these investments. Changes in value are recorded in earnings. AIG obtains the fair value of its investments in limited partnerships and hedge funds from information provided by the general partner or manager of each of these investments, the accounts of which are generally audited on an annual basis. Each of these investment categories is regularly tested to determine if impairment in value exists. Various valuation techniques are used with respect to each category in this determination.'),\n",

See also Note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements. Aircraft Finance\\nAIG’s Aircraft Finance operations represent the operations of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to domestic and foreign airlines. Revenues also result from the remarketing of commercial jets for its own account, for airlines and for financial institutions. ILFC finances its purchases of aircraft primarily through the issuance of a variety of debt instruments. The composite borrowing rates at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were 4.34 percent, 4.53 percent and 4.73 percent, respectively. See also the discussions under “Capital Resources” and “Liquidity” herein and Notes 3 and 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. ILFC is exposed to operating loss and liquidity strain through nonperformance of aircraft lessees, through owning aircraft which it would be unable to sell or re-lease at acceptable rates at lease expiration and, in part, through committing to purchase aircraft which it would be unable to lease. ILFC manages its lessee nonperformance exposure through credit reviews and security deposit requirements. As a result of these measures and its own contingency planning, ILFC did not suffer any material losses from airline shutdowns in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, but there can be no assurance that ILFC will successfully manage the risks relating to the effect of possible future deterioration in the airline industry. Over 80 percent of ILFC’s fleet is leased to non-U.S. carriers, and this fleet, comprised of the most efficient aircraft in the airline industry, continues to be in high demand from such carriers. ILFC typically contracts to re-lease aircraft before the end of the existing lease term. For aircraft returned before the end of the lease term, ILFC has generally been able to re-lease such aircraft within two to six months of its return. While some of the lease rates for aircraft that have been redeployed are lower, the effect of these reduced revenues is partially offset by low interest rates, which reduces ILFC’s financing costs. As a lessor, ILFC considers an aircraft “idle” or “off lease” when the aircraft is not subject to a signed lease agreement or signed letter of intent. ILFC had one aircraft off lease at December 31, 2004. As of March 31, 2005, all new aircraft deliveries in 2005 have been leased, and 92 percent of 2006 new aircraft deliveries have been leased. See also the discussions under “Capital Resources” and “Liquidity” herein. ILFC sold two portfolios consisting of 34 and 37 aircraft in 2004 and 2003, respectively, to two trusts connected to securitization transactions. Certain of AIG’s Life Insurance & Retirement Services businesses purchased a large share of the securities issued in connection with these securitizations, which included both debt and equity securities. Management formally reviews regularly, and no less frequently than quarterly, issues affecting ILFC’s fleet, including events and circumstances that may cause impairment of aircraft values. Management evaluates aircraft in the fleet as necessary, based on these events and circumstances in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 - “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (FAS 144). ILFC has not recognized any impairment related to its fleet, as the existing service potential of the aircraft in ILFC’s portfolio has not been diminished. Further, ILFC has been able to re-lease the aircraft without diminution in lease rates to an extent that would require an impairment write-down. See also the discussions under “Liquidity” herein. Capital Markets\\nAIG’s Capital Markets operations represents the integrated operations of AIGFP and AIGTG. The integration of its Capital Markets operations has produced and will continue to produce greater efficiencies and product synergies as well as growth opportunities. As Capital Markets is a transaction-oriented operation, current and past revenues and operating results may not provide a basis for predicting future performance. Also, AIG’s Capital Markets operations may be adversely affected by the downgrades in AIG’s credit ratings. See “Certain Factors Affecting AIG’s Business - AIG’s Credit Ratings,” for a further discussion of the potential effect of the rating downgrades on AIG’s Capital Markets businesses. AIG’s Capital Markets operations derive substantially all their revenues from proprietary positions entered in connection with counterparty transactions rather than from speculative transactions. These subsidiaries participate in the derivatives dealer market conducting, primarily as principal, an interest rate, currency, equity, commodity, and credit products business. As a dealer, AIGFP marks all derivative and trading transactions to fair value daily. Thus, a gain or loss on each transaction is recognized daily. Under GAAP, certain gains and losses are required to be recorded immediately in earnings, whereas in other instances, they are required to be recognized over the life of the underlying contracts. AIGFP hedges the market risks arising from its transactions. Therefore, revenues and operating income are not significantly exposed to or af-\\nFORM 10-K : 79\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nfected by market fluctuations and volatility except for the volatility resulting from FAS 133 adjustments on positions that did not qualify for hedge accounting. See the discussion of the effect of FAS 133 under “Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements” herein. Revenues of the Capital Markets operations and the percentage change in revenues for any given period are significantly affected by the number and size of transactions entered into by these subsidiaries during that period relative to those entered into during the prior period. Operating income and the percentage change in operating income for any period are determined by the number, size and profitability of the transactions attributable to that period relative to those attributable to the prior period. Generally, the realization of trading revenues as measured by the receipt of funds is not a significant reporting event as the gain or loss on AIGFP’s trading transactions are currently reflected in operating income as the fair values change from period to period. Derivative transactions are entered into in the ordinary course of Capital Markets operations. Therefore, income on interest rate, currency, equity, commodity, and credit derivatives, along with their related hedges, are recorded on a mark to market value or at estimated fair value where market prices are not readily available with the resulting unrealized gains or losses reflected in the income statement in the current year. In 2004, less than five percent of revenues resulted from transactions valued at estimated fair value. The mark to fair value of derivative transactions is reflected in the balance sheet in the captions “Unrealized gain on swaps, options and forward transactions” and “Unrealized loss on swaps, options and forward transactions.” Pursuant to ISDA Master Agreements, unrealized gains represent the present value of the aggregate of each net receivable by counterparty, and the unrealized losses represent the present value of the aggregate of each net payable by counterparty as of December 31, 2004. These amounts will change from one period to the next due to changes in interest rates, currency rates, equity and commodity prices and other market variables, as well as cash movements, execution of new transactions and the maturing of existing transactions.'),\n",

To the extent the Financial Services subsidiaries, other than AIGFP, use derivatives to hedge their assets or liabilities with respect to their future cash flows, and such hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133 (as previously discussed in Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements), the changes in fair value of such derivatives are recorded in realized capital gains (losses) or other revenues. Financial market conditions in 2004 compared with 2003 were characterized by interest rates which were broadly unchanged across fixed income markets globally, a tightening of credit spreads and higher equity valuations. Capital Markets results in 2004 compared with 2003 reflected a shift in product segment activity to respond to these conditions.'),\n",

The most significant component of Capital Markets operating expenses is compensation, which was approximately $497 million, $616 million and $557 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The amount of compensation was not affected by unrealized gains or losses attributable to economic hedges, including the related foreign exchange gains and losses not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133. The decrease in Aircraft Finance operating income reflects the effect of the disposition of approximately $2 billion in aircraft through securitizations in the third quarter 2003 and first quarter 2004. Offsetting the benefit to operating income of the growth in ILFC’s aircraft fleet is a decrease of its lease margin for 2004 compared to 2003. With respect to ILFC, the revenue growth in each year resulted primarily from the increase in flight equipment under operating lease, despite the aforementioned effect of securitizations, and the increase in the relative value of the leased fleet. The decline in ILFC’s operating income for 2003 was largely a result of the decline in aircraft remarketing due to the relatively weak market conditions for the sale of secondhand aircraft. ILFC continued to see net improvements in lease rates and an increasing level of interest from traditional buyers, third-party investors and debt providers for the purchase of aircraft from ILFC’s extensive lease portfolio. Thus, the outlook for 2005 is positive. In connection with a global aircraft lease transaction entered into in 2000 for a total of 14 aircraft, ILFC acquired certain securities of and issued certain guarantees to ATA Airlines and related entities (ATA). During the fourth quarter of 2004, ATA filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On the basis of estimates of the probable outcome of the ATA bankruptcy, ILFC recorded a charge in the fourth quarter to write down the value of the ATA securities and record obligations assumed under the guarantee. The pre-tax charges aggregated $54 million (reported as a realized capital loss) and did not have a material effect on AIG’s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. ATA has cured all of the defaults under the existing leases and continues to perform under the leases at the pre-bankruptcy contracted lease terms. Consumer Finance operations, both domestically and internationally, did very well with increased revenues and operating income.'),\n",

Credit quality continues to be strong. Foreign Consumer Finance operations performed well, as the operations in Poland continued its strong growth, and the Hong Kong credit card business benefited from the strengthening local economy, resulting in less need for loan loss provisions. Further, reductions of the cost to borrow led to an improvement in the operating income in 2003 over 2002. Financial Services operating income represented 17.5 percent of AIG’s consolidated income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes in 2004. This compares to 10.6 percent and 23.4 percent in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in contribution percentage in 2004 and the decrease in 2003 was primarily due to the fluctuation in earnings resulting from derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133. The decrease in contribution percentage in 2003 was also influenced by the effect of the 2002 General Insurance loss reserve charge on General Insurance operating income and the reduced contribution of General Insurance operations to income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes.

As previously discussed, the cash used for the purchase of flight equipment is derived primarily from the proceeds of ILFC’s debt financings. The primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are the cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of flight equipment and the rollover and refinancing of the prior debt. During 2004, ILFC acquired flight equipment costing $4.96 billion. See also the discussion under “Operating Review - Financial Services Operations” and “Capital Resources” herein. At December 31, 2004, ILFC had committed to purchase 371 new and used aircraft deliverable from 2005 through 2010 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $21.6 billion and had options to purchase six new aircraft deliverable through 2007 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $361 million. As of March 31, 2005, ILFC has entered into leases for all of the new aircraft to be delivered in 2005, 86 of 93 of the new aircraft to be delivered in 2006 and 29 of 166 of the new aircraft to be delivered subsequent to 2006. ILFC will be required to find customers for any aircraft currently on order and any aircraft to be ordered, and it must arrange financing for portions of the purchase price of such equipment. In a rising interest rate environment, ILFC negotiates higher lease rates on any new contracts. ILFC has been successful to date both in placing its new aircraft on lease or under sales contract and obtaining adequate financing, but there can be no assurance that such success will continue in future environments. AIG’s Consumer Finance operations provide a wide variety of consumer finance products both domestically and overseas. Such products include real estate mortgages, consumer loans, and retail sales finance. These products are funded through deposits and various borrowings including commercial paper and medium term notes. AIG’s Consumer Finance operations are exposed to credit risk and risk of loss resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates. Over half of the loan balance is related to real estate loans which are substantially collateralized by the related properties. With respect to credit losses, the allowance for finance receivable losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to absorb anticipated credit losses existing in that portfolio. Capital Markets derivative transactions are carried at market value or at estimated fair value when market prices are not readily available. AIGFP reduces its economic risk exposure through similarly valued offsetting transactions including swaps, trading securities, options, forwards and futures. The estimated fair values of these transactions represent assessments of the present value of expected future cash flows. These transactions are exposed to liquidity risk if AIGFP were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes that the effect of any such event would not be significant to AIG’s financial condition or its overall liquidity. See also the discussion under “Operating Review - Financial Services Operations” and “Derivatives” herein. AIGFP uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes and bonds and GIA borrowings to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities, including securities available for sale, at market, and derivative transactions. The funds may also be temporarily invested in securities purchased under agreements to resell. The proceeds from the disposal of the aforementioned securities available for sale and securities purchased under agreements to resell have been used to fund the maturing GIAs or other AIGFP financings. See also the discussion under “Capital Resources” herein.'),\n",

At December 31, 2004, the average credit rating of this portfolio was AA+ or the equivalent thereto as determined through rating agencies or internal review. AIGFP has also entered into credit derivative transactions to economically hedge its credit risk associated with $225 million of these securities. Securities deemed below investment grade at December 31, 2004 amounted to approximately $62 million in fair value representing 0.2 percent of the total AIGFP securities available for sale. There have been no significant downgrades through March 31, 2005. AIGFP’s risk management objective is to minimize interest rate, currency, commodity and equity risks associated with its securities available for sale. That is, when AIGFP purchases a security for its securities available for sale investment portfolio, it simultaneously enters into an offsetting internal hedge such that the payment terms of the hedging transaction offset the payment terms of the investment security, which achieves the economic result of converting the return on the underlying security to USD LIBOR plus or minus a spread based on the underlying profit on each security on the initial trade date. The market risk associated with such internal hedges is managed on a portfolio basis, with third party hedging transactions executed as necessary. As hedge accounting treatment is not achieved in accordance with FAS 133, the unrealized gains and losses on these securities, resulting from changes in interest rates, currency rates, commodity and equity prices, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income while the unrealized gains and losses on the related economic hedges are reflected in operating income. When a security is sold, the related hedging transaction is terminated. The realized gain or loss with respect to each security is then recorded in operating income. Securities purchased under agreements to resell are treated as collateralized financing transactions. AIGFP takes possession of or obtains a security interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell. AIGFP further minimizes its credit risk by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and, when it deems necessary, it requires additional collateral to be deposited. Trading securities, at market value are marked to market daily and are held to meet the short-term risk management objectives of AIGFP. AIGFP is exposed to credit risk. If its securities available for sale portfolio were to suffer significant default and the collateral held declined significantly in value with no replacement, or the credit default swap counterparty failed to perform, AIGFP could have a liquidity strain. AIG guarantees AIGFP’s payment obligations, including its debt obligations. AIGFP also conducts, as principal, market-making and trading activities in foreign exchange and commodities, primarily precious metals. AIGFP owns inventories in the commodities in which it trades and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the use of swaps, forwards, futures, and option contracts. AIGFP uses derivatives to manage the economic exposure of its various trading positions and transactions from adverse movements of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. AIGFP supports its trading activities largely through trading liabilities, unrealized losses on swaps, short-term borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities and commodities sold but not yet purchased. See also the discussions under “Capital Resources” herein and Note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements. The gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses of Capital Markets operations included in the financial services assets and liabilities at December 31, 2004 were as follows:\\n(a)\\nSee also Note 8(h) of Notes to Financial Statements. (b)\\nThese amounts are also presented as the respective balance sheet amounts. AIGFP’s interest rate and currency risks on securities available for sale, at market, are economically managed by taking internal offsetting positions on a security by security basis with its derivatives portfolio, thereby offsetting a significant portion of the unrealized appreciation or depreciation. As previously discussed in “Financial Services Results” these economic offsets do not meet the hedge accounting requirements of FAS 133. Trading securities, at market value, and securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased, at market value, are marked to market daily with the unrealized gain or loss being recognized in income at that time. These trading securities are held to meet the short-term risk management objectives of Capital Markets operations. The senior management of AIG defines the policies and establishes general operating parameters for Capital Markets operations. AIG’s senior management has established various oversight committees to review the various financial market, operational and credit issues of the Capital Markets operations. The senior management of AIGFP reports the results of its operations to and reviews future strategies with AIG’s senior management. FORM 10-K : 83\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nAIG actively manages the exposures to limit potential losses, while maximizing the rewards afforded by these business opportunities. In doing so, AIG must continually manage a variety of exposures including credit, market, liquidity, operational and legal risks. AIGFP held a large portfolio of privately negotiated financing transactions with institutional counterparties in the United Kingdom. Certain provisions in the UK Finance Bill that was published by the House of Commons on March 22, 2005 have caused AIGFP’s counterparties to exercise rights to unwind these transactions early. Although the unwind of these transactions will not cause AIGFP to suffer any losses, the unwinds do mean that AIGFP will not realize spread income in the future that AIGFP expects it would have realized had the transactions remained outstanding. The aggregate reduction in 2005 operating income attributable to such foregone future accrual earnings is currently expected to be approximately $75 million. Asset Management Operations\\nAIG’s Asset Management operations comprise a wide variety of investment-related services and investment products including institutional and retail asset management, broker dealer services and spread-based investment business from the sale of guaranteed investment contracts, also known as funding agreements (GICs). Such services and products are offered to individuals and institutions both domestically and overseas. As discussed above, AIG Retirement Services operations are now reported with Life Insurance operations. Therefore, Asset Management operations now represent the results of AIG’s asset management and brokerage services operations, mutual fund operations and the foreign and domestic GIC operations. Asset Management revenues and operating income for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows:\\n(a)\\nIncludes AIG Global Investment Group and certain smaller asset management operations. (b)\\nIncludes the results of certain AIG managed private equity and real estate funds that are consolidated effective December 31, 2003 pursuant to FIN46R, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”. For 2004, operating income includes $195 million of third-party limited partner earnings offset in Minority interest expense. Asset Management Results\\nAsset Management operating income increased in 2004 as a result of the upturn in worldwide financial markets and a strong global product portfolio. The operating income growth results from fees related to the management of mutual funds and various investment portfolios that are, in great part, contingent upon the growth in the equity markets and customer interest in equity sensitive products. Thus, as equity markets expand and contract, the appetite for listed and private equity investments changes.'),\n",

AIG expects to launch a matched investment program utilizing issuances of AIG debt securities, which will become AIG’s principal spread-based investment activity. In light of recent developments, the timing of the launch of this program is unclear. See “Certain Factors Affecting AIG’s Business - Access to Capital Markets” for a discussion of how the timing of this program may be delayed. Because AIG’s credit spreads in the capital markets have widened following the ratings declines, there may be a reduction in the earnings on new business in AIG’s institutional spread based funding business. Asset Management operating income represented 12.0 percent of AIG’s consolidated income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes in 2004.

Other income (deductions)-net amounted to $(334) million, $(1.17) billion and $(606) million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. AIG’s equity in certain partially owned subsidiaries includes $96 million in catastrophe losses in 2004. The decline in 2003 was primarily the result of increases in pension and interest expenses. Capital Resources\\nAt December 31, 2004, AIG had total consolidated shareholders’ equity of $80.61 billion and total borrowings of $95.26 billion. At that date, $85.28 billion of such borrowings were either not guaranteed by AIG or were AIGFP’s matched borrowings under obligations of guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs) or matched notes and bonds payable.

During 2004, AIG did not issue any medium term notes, and $124 million of previously issued notes matured or were redeemed. AIG completed an exchange offer in April 2004 with respect to Rule 144A/ Regulation S Notes and issued in exchange substantially identical notes that are registered under the Securities Act. On August 15, 2004, Eurodollar zero coupon notes with a face value of $189 million matured. AIG intends to continue its customary practice of issuing debt securities from time to time to meet its financing needs and those of certain of its subsidiaries for general corporate purposes, as well as to initiate a matched investment program. However AIG’s ability to do so may be limited due to the delay in filing its periodic financial reports. See “Certain Factors Affecting AIG’s Business - Access to Capital Markets.”\\nOn November 9, 2001, AIG received proceeds of approximately $1 billion from the issuance of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2031 with an aggregate principal amount at maturity of approximately $1.52 billion. Commencing January 1, 2002, the debentures are convertible into shares of AIG common stock at a conversion rate of 6.0627 shares per $1,000 principal amount of debentures if AIG common stock trades at certain levels for certain time periods. The debentures are callable by AIG on or after November 9, 2006. Also, holders can require AIG to repurchase these debentures once every five years beginning on November 9, 2006. AIGFP uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes and bonds and GIA borrowings to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities and derivative transactions. The borrowings may also be temporarily invested in securities purchased under agreements to resell. See also the discussions under “Operating Review,” “Liquidity” and “Derivatives” herein and Notes 1, 8, 9 and 20 of Notes to Financial Statements. AIGFP has established a Euro Medium Term Note Program under which an aggregate principal amount of up to $5.0 billion of notes may be outstanding. The program provides that additional notes may be issued to replace matured or redeemed notes.

During 2002, AGC issued $200 million in notes which matured in March 2003. During 2004, $149 million of previously issued notes matured. Preferred stock issued by an AGC subsidiary, American General Capital I, with a liquidation value of $200 million was redeemed for cash on September 8, 2004. AGC redeemed the related Junior Subordinated Debentures at that time, extinguishing the liabilities connected to the trust preferred stock. ILFC fulfills its short term cash requirements through the issuance of commercial paper. The issuance of commercial paper is subject to the approval of ILFC’s Board of Directors and is not guaranteed by AIG. ILFC is a party to unsecured syndicated revolving credit facilities aggregating $6.0 billion at December 31, 2004.

ILFC expects to replace or extend these credit facilities on or prior to their expiration. There are currently no borrowings under these facilities, nor were any borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2004. During 2004, ILFC increased the aggregate principal amount outstanding of its medium term and long-term notes, which included $518 million resulting from foreign exchange translation into U.S. dollars as of year-end. ILFC had $13.13 billion of debt securities registered for public sale at December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2004, $5.59 billion of debt securities were issued. In addition, ILFC has a Euro Medium Term Note Program for $7.0 billion, under which $4.48 billion in notes were sold through December 31, 2004. ILFC has substantially eliminated the currency exposure arising from foreign-currency denominated notes by either hedging the notes through swaps or through the offset provided by operating lease payments in Euros. Notes issued under this program are included in Notes and Bonds Payable in the preceding table of borrowings. ILFC had a $4.3 billion Export Credit Facility for use in connection with the purchase of approximately 75 aircraft delivered through 2001. This facility was guaranteed by various European Export Credit Agencies. The interest rate varies from 5.75 percent to 5.90 percent on these amortizing ten-year borrowings depending on the delivery date of the aircraft. At December 31, 2004, ILFC had $1.5 billion outstanding under this facility. The debt is collateralized by a pledge of the shares of a subsidiary of ILFC, which holds title to the aircraft financed under the facility. In May 2004, ILFC entered into a similarly structured Export Credit Facility (ECA) for up to a maximum of $2.64 billion for Airbus aircraft to be delivered in 2004 and 2005. The facility becomes available as the various European Export Credit Agencies provide their guarantees for aircraft based on a six-month forward-looking calendar, and the interest rate is determined through a bid process. At December 31, 2004, ILFC had $202 million outstanding under this facility. Borrowings with respect to these facilities are included in Notes and Bonds Payable in the preceding table of borrowings. In August 2004, ILFC received a commitment for an Ex-Im Bank comprehensive guarantee in the amount of $1.68 billion to support the financing of up to 30 new Boeing aircraft. The delivery period initially extends from September 1, 2004 through August 31, 2005, but may be extended to August 31, 2006. ILFC did not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2004. During 2003, ILFC entered into various bank financings for a total funded amount of $1.3 billion.

The terms and\\nFORM 10-K : 87\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nconditions of these agreements are identical to AGF’s 364-day revolving credit facility. During 2004, AGF issued $2.96 billion of fixed rate and variable rate medium term notes ranging in maturities from two to ten years. As of December 31, 2004, notes aggregating $13.71 billion were outstanding with maturity dates ranging from 2005 to 2014 at interest rates ranging from 1.38 percent to 7.50 percent. To the extent deemed appropriate, AGF may enter into swap transactions to manage its effective borrowing with respect to these notes. In addition, AGF issued $2.86 billion of long-term funding in 2004 from sources including Euro-denominated and Sterling-denominated transactions totaling the equivalent of $1.82 billion. Other funding sources included private placement debt, retail note issuances and bank financings. AIG Credit Card Company (Taiwan) - (AIGCCC-Taiwan) and AIG Finance (Taiwan) Limited - (AIGF-Taiwan), both consumer finance subsidiaries in Taiwan, have issued commercial paper for the funding of their own operations. At December 31, 2004, AIG did not guarantee the commercial paper of any of its subsidiaries other than AIG Funding.

FORM 10-K : 89\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\n“Rating triggers” have been defined by one independent rating agency to include clauses or agreements the outcome of which depends upon the level of ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies. Rating triggers generally relate to events which (i) could result in the termination or limitation of credit availability, or require accelerated repayment, (ii) could result in the termination of business contracts or (iii) could require a company to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties. AIG believes that any of its or its subsidiaries’ contractual obligations that are subject to “ratings triggers” or financial covenants relating to “ratings triggers” would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, future operating results or liquidity. As a result of the downgrades of AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings, AIG has been required to post approximately $1.16 billion of collateral with counterparties to municipal guaranteed investment contracts and financial derivatives transactions. In the event of a further downgrade, AIG will be required to post additional collateral. It is estimated that, as of the close of business on May 18, 2005, based on AIG’s outstanding municipal guaranteed investment contracts and financial derivatives transactions as of such date, a further downgrade of AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings to ‘Aa3’ by Moody’s or ‘AA-’ by S&P would permit counterparties to call for approximately $2.33 billion of additional collateral. Further, additional downgrades could result in requirements for substantial additional collateral, which could have a material effect on how AIG manages its liquidity. The actual amount of additional collateral that AIG would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades depends on market conditions, the market value of the outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade. The requirement to post additional collateral may increase if additional counterparties begin to require credit support from AIG through collateralization agreements. Additional obligations to post collateral will increase the demand on AIG’s liquidity. Shareholders’ Equity\\nAIG’s consolidated shareholders’ equity increased $10.58 billion during 2004. During 2004, retained earnings increased $9.0 billion, resulting from net income less dividends. Unrealized appreciation of investments, net of taxes, increased $1.35 billion and the cumulative translation adjustment loss, net of taxes, decreased $686 million. During 2004, there was a gain of $333 million, net of taxes, relating to derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments. See also the discussion under “Operating Review” and “Liquidity” herein, Notes 1(z), 8(d) and 20 of Notes to Financial Statements and the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. AIG has in the past reinvested most of its unrestricted earnings in its operations and believes such continued reinvestment in the future will be adequate to meet any foreseeable capital needs. However, AIG may choose from time to time to raise additional funds through the issuance of additional securities. Stock Purchase\\nDuring 2004, AIG purchased in the open market 16,299,300 shares of its common stock. AIG from time to time may buy shares of its common stock in the open market for general corporate purposes, including to satisfy its obligations under various employee benefit plans. At December 31, 2004, an additional 39,019,800 shares could be purchased under the then current authorization by AIG’s Board of Directors. Through March 31, 2005, AIG purchased an additional 2,477,100 shares of its common stock. Dividends from Insurance Subsidiaries\\nPayments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities. With respect to AIG’s domestic insurance subsidiaries, the payment of any dividend requires formal notice to the insurance department in which the particular insurance subsidiary is domiciled. Under the laws of many states, an insurer may pay a dividend without prior approval of the insurance regulator when the amount of the dividend is below certain regulatory thresholds. Largely as a result of the restrictions, approximately 89 percent of consolidated shareholders’ equity was restricted from immediate transfer to AIG parent at December 31, 2004. However, AIG cannot predict how recent regulatory investigations may affect the ability of its regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. See “Certain Factors Affecting AIG’s Business - Regulatory Investigations.”\\nWith respect to AIG’s foreign insurance subsidiaries, the most significant insurance regulatory jurisdictions include Bermuda, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, Thailand and Singapore. AIG cannot predict whether the regulatory investigations currently underway or future regulatory issues will impair AIG’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. To AIG’s knowledge, no AIG company is currently on any regulatory or similar “watch list” with regard to solvency. See also the discussion under “Liquidity” herein and Note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements, as well as “Certain Factors Affecting AIG’s Business.”\\n90 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nRegulation and Supervision\\nAIG’s insurance subsidiaries, in common with other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. In the U.S. the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has developed Risk-Based Capital (RBC) requirements. RBC relates an individual insurance company’s statutory surplus to the risk inherent in its overall operations. At December 31, 2004, the risk-based adjusted surplus of each of AIG’s Domestic General companies and of each of AIG’s Domestic Life companies exceeded each of their RBC standards. As discussed above, various regulators have commenced investigations into certain insurance business practices, including with respect to AIG. While such investigations are in their early stages, it is possible that they may result in additional regulation of the insurance industry and specific action with respect to AIG, and AIG cannot predict the ultimate effect that such additional regulation might have on its business. Federal, state or local legislation may affect AIG’s ability to operate and expand its various financial services businesses, and changes in the current laws, regulations or interpretations thereof may have a material adverse effect on these businesses. See “Certain Factors Affecting AIG’s Business - Regulatory Investigations” for a further discussion of the effect these investigations may have on AIG’s businesses. AIG’s U.S. operations are negatively affected under guarantee fund assessment laws which exist in most states. As a result of operating in a state which has guarantee fund assessment laws, a solvent insurance company may be assessed for certain obligations arising from the insolvencies of other insurance companies which operated in that state. AIG generally records these assessments upon notice. Additionally, certain states permit at least a portion of the assessed amount to be used as a credit against a company’s future premium tax liabilities.'),\n",

A substantial portion of AIG’s General Insurance business and a majority of its Life Insurance & Retirement Services business are conducted in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. Thus, AIG’s insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. AIG’s international operations include operations in various developing nations. Both current and future foreign operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable political developments up to and including nationalization of AIG’s operations without compensation. Adverse effects resulting from any one country may affect AIG’s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition depending on the magnitude of the event and AIG’s net financial exposure at that time in that country. Foreign operations are individually subject to local solvency margin requirements that require maintenance of adequate capitalization, which AIG complies with by country. In addition, certain foreign locations, notably Japan, have established regulations that can result in guarantee fund assessments. These have not had a material effect on AIG’s operations. Liquidity\\nAIG’s liquidity is primarily derived from the operating cash flows of its General and Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations. Management believes that AIG’s liquid assets, its net cash provided by operations, and access to short term funding through commercial paper and bank credit facilities will enable it to meet any anticipated cash requirements. See “Certain Factors Affecting AIG’s Business - Access to Capital Markets.”\\nAt December 31, 2004, AIG’s consolidated invested assets included $18.11 billion of cash and short-term investments. Consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in 2004 amounted to $35.58 billion. The liquidity of the combined insurance operations is derived both domestically and abroad. The combined insurance operating cash flow is derived from two sources, underwriting operations and investment operations. Cash flow includes periodic premium collections, including policyholders’ contract deposits, cash flows from investment operations and paid loss recoveries less reinsurance premiums, losses, benefits, and acquisition and operating expenses. Generally, there is a time lag from when premiums are collected and, when as a result of the occurrence of events specified in the policy, the losses and benefits are paid. Investment income cash flow is primarily derived from interest and dividends received and includes realized capital gains net of realized capital losses. See also the discussions under “Operating Review - General Insurance\\nFORM 10-K : 91\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nOperations” and “Life Insurance & Retirement Services Operations” herein. With respect to General Insurance operations, if paid losses accelerated beyond AIG’s ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows, AIG might need to liquidate a portion of its General Insurance investment portfolio and/or arrange for financing. Potential events causing such a liquidity strain could be the result of several significant catastrophic events occurring in a relatively short period of time. Additional strain on liquidity could occur if the investments sold to fund such paid losses were sold into a depressed market place and/or reinsurance recoverable on such paid losses became uncollectible or collateral supporting such reinsurance recoverable significantly decreased in value. See also the discussions under “Operating Review - General Insurance Operations” herein. With respect to Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations, if a substantial portion of the Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations bond portfolio diminished significantly in value and/or defaulted, AIG might need to liquidate other portions of its Life Insurance & Retirement Services investment portfolio and/or arrange financing. Potential events causing such a liquidity strain could be the result of economic collapse of a nation or region in which AIG Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations exist, nationalization, terrorist acts, or other such economic or political upheaval. In addition, a significant rise in interest rates leading to a significant increase in policyholder surrenders could also create a liquidity strain.'),\n",

In addition to the combined insurance pretax operating cash flow, AIG’s insurance operations held $7.63 billion in cash and short-term investments at December 31, 2004. Operating cash flow and the cash and short-term balances held provided AIG’s insurance operations with a significant amount of liquidity. This liquidity is available, among other things, to purchase predominately high quality and diversified fixed income securities and, to a lesser extent, marketable equity securities, and to provide mortgage loans on real estate, policy loans, and collateral loans. This cash flow coupled with proceeds of approximately $126 billion from the maturities, sales and redemptions of fixed income securities and from the sale of equity securities was used to purchase approximately $184 billion of fixed income securities and marketable equity securities during 2004. AIG’s major Financial Services operating subsidiaries consist of AIGFP, ILFC, AGF and AIGCFG. Sources of funds considered in meeting the liquidity needs of AIGFP’s operations include guaranteed investment agreements, issuance of long-term and short-term debt, maturities and sales of securities available for sale, securities sold under repurchase agreements, trading liabilities, and securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased. ILFC, AGF and AIGCFG all utilize the commercial paper markets, bank loans and bank credit facilities as sources of liquidity. ILFC and AGF also fund in the domestic and international capital markets without reliance on any guarantee from AIG. An additional source of liquidity for ILFC is the use of export credit facilities. AIGCFG also uses wholesale and retail bank deposits as sources of funds. On occasion, AIG has provided equity capital to ILFC, AGF and AIGCFG and provides intercompany loans to AIGCFG. Cash flow provided from operations is a major source of liquidity for AIG’s primary Financial Services operating subsidiaries. AIG, the parent company, funds its short-term working capital needs through commercial paper issued by AIG Funding. As of March 31, 2005, AIG Funding had $3.485 billion of commercial paper outstanding with an average maturity of 26 days. As additional liquidity, AIG parent has a $2 billion inter-company revolving credit facility provided by certain of its subsidiaries, a $1.375 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facility that expires in July 2005 and a $1.375 billion five year revolving bank credit facility that expires in July 2007. AIG parent’s primary sources of cash flow are dividends and loans from its subsidiaries. Largely as a result of regulatory restrictions, approximately 89 percent of consolidated shareholders’ equity was restricted from immediate transfer to AIG parent at December 31, 2004. However AIG cannot predict how recent regulatory investigations may affect the ability of its regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. See “Certain Factors Affecting AIG’s Business - Regulatory Investigations.” AIG parent’s primary uses of cash flow are for debt service and the payment of dividends to shareholders. As of March 31, 2005, including debt obligations of AGC that are guaranteed by AIG, remaining debt maturities due in 2005 are $300 million, $55 million and $500 million for the second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. See also Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on debt maturities for AIG and its subsidiaries. Special Purpose Vehicles and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements\\nAIG uses special purpose vehicles (SPVs) and off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business. As a result of recent changes in accounting, a number of SPVs and off balance sheet arrangements have been reflected in AIG’s consolidated financial statements.

Derivatives\\nDerivatives are financial instruments among two or more parties with returns linked to or “derived” from some underlying equity, debt, commodity or other asset, liability, or index. Derivatives payments may be based on interest rates and exchange rates and/or prices of certain securities, certain commodities, financial or commodity indices, or other variables. The more significant types of derivative arrangements in which AIG transacts are swaps, forwards, futures and options. In the normal course of business, with the agreement of the original counterparty, these contracts may be terminated early or assigned to another counterparty. The overwhelming majority of AIG’s derivatives activities are conducted by the Capital Markets operations, thus permitting AIG to participate in the derivatives dealer market acting primarily as principal. In these derivative operations, AIG structures agreements which generally allow its counterparties to enter into transactions with respect to changes in interest and exchange rates, securities’ prices and certain commodities and financial or commodity indices. AIG’s customers - such as corporations, financial institutions, multinational organizations, sovereign entities, government agencies and municipalities - use derivatives to hedge their own market exposures. For example, a futures, forward or option contract can be used to protect the customers’ assets or liabilities against price fluctuations. A counterparty may default on any obligation to AIG, including a derivative contract. Credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and/or carrying trading and investment positions. Credit risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to AIG. To help manage this risk, AIGFP’s credit department operates within the guidelines set by the AIG Credit Risk Committee. This committee establishes the credit policy, sets limits for counterparties and provides limits for derivative transactions with counterparties having different credit ratings. In addition to credit ratings, this committee takes into account other factors, including the industry and country of the counterparty. Transactions which fall outside these pre-established guidelines require the approval of the AIG Credit Risk Committee. It is also AIG’s policy to establish reserves for potential credit impairment when appropriate. In addition, AIGFP utilizes various credit enhancements, including letters of credit, guarantees, collateral, credit triggers, credit derivatives, and margin agreements to reduce the credit risk relating to its outstanding derivative financial transactions. AIGFP requires credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties, and the transaction’s size and maturity. AIG’s Derivatives Review Committee provides an independent review of any proposed derivative transaction or program except those derivative transactions entered into by AIGFP with third parties. The committee examines, among other things, the nature and purpose of the derivative transaction, its potential credit exposure, if any, and the estimated benefits. Generally, AIG conducts its businesses in the currencies of the local operating environment. Thus, exchange gains or losses occur when AIG’s foreign currency net investment is affected by changes in the foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar from one reporting period to the next. FAS 133 requires that third-party derivatives used for hedging must be specifically matched with the underlying exposures to an outside third party and documented contemporaneously to qualify for hedge accounting treatment. In many cases AIG did not meet these hedging requirements with respect to certain hedging transactions. AIG has historically reported the changes in the fair value of certain derivatives used for hedging activities through other comprehensive income in consolidated shareholders’ equity or in net income with a corresponding adjustment to the hedged\\nFORM 10-K : 93\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nitem, depending on the nature of the hedge relationship. In order to comply with FAS 133, the restated consolidated financial statements include the changes in fair value for certain derivatives, previously recorded through other comprehensive income, in current period income and reverse the previous adjustments on assets and liabilities recorded in net income in connection with hedge accounting. Because these derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 - “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” requires AIG to recognize the corresponding changes in fair value, including foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate fluctuations relating to available for sale investments through other comprehensive income. These restatement adjustments with respect to FAS 133 do not result in any changes in AIG’s liquidity or its overall financial condition even though inter-period volatility of earnings increased. See also Notes 2 and 20 of Notes to Financial Statements for detailed information relating to AIG’s derivative activities, and Note 1(z) of Notes to Financial Statements for AIG’s derivative accounting policies. Managing Market Risk\\nMarket risk is the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies, equities and commodity prices. AIG has exposures to these risks. AIG analyzes market risk using various statistical techniques including Value at Risk (VaR). VaR is a summary statistical measure that applies the estimated volatility and correlation of market factors to AIG’s market positions. The output from the VaR calculation is the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time given a certain probability. While VaR models are relatively sophisticated, the quantitative market risk information generated is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related models. AIG believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk. Therefore, such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management. Insurance\\nAIG has performed a separate VaR analysis for the General Insurance and Life Insurance & Retirement Services segments and for each market risk within each segment. For purposes of the VaR calculation, the insurance assets and liabilities from GICs are included in the Life Insurance & Retirement Services segment. For the calculations in the analyses the financial instrument assets included are the insurance segments’ invested assets, excluding real estate and investment income due and accrued, and the financial instrument liabilities included are reserve for losses and loss expenses, reserve for unearned premiums, future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and other policyholders’ funds. AIG calculated the VaR with respect to the net fair value of each of AIG’s insurance segments as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. The VaR number represents the maximum potential loss that could be incurred with a 95 percent confidence (i.e., only five percent of historical scenarios show losses greater than the VaR figure) within a one-month holding period. AIG uses the historical simulation methodology that entails repricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period. AIG uses the most recent three years of historical market information for interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity index prices. For each scenario, each transaction was repriced. Portfolio, business unit, and finally AIG-wide scenario values are then calculated by netting the values of all the underlying assets and liabilities. The following table presents the VaR on a combined basis and of each component of market risk for each of AIG’s insurance segments as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. Due to diversification effects, the combined VaR is always smaller than the sum of its components. 94 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nThe following table presents the average, high and low VaRs on a combined basis and of each component of market risk for each of AIG’s insurance segments as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. Due to diversification effects, the combined VaR is always smaller than the sum of its components. VaR figures are typically amplified when yields fall dramatically over time. The notable increase in the Combined and Interest rate VaRs from 2003 to 2004 in the Life Insurance & Retirement Services segment was predominantly caused by continuing declines in yields throughout Asia, along with strong growth in the Asian life businesses. Financial Services\\nAIG generally manages its market exposures within Financial Services by maintaining offsetting positions. Capital Markets seeks to minimize or set limits for open or uncovered market positions. Credit exposure is managed separately. See the discussion on the management of credit risk above. AIG’s Market Risk Management Department provides detailed independent review of AIG’s market exposures, particularly those market exposures of the Capital Markets operations. This department determines whether AIG’s market risks, as well as those market risks of individual subsidiaries, are within the parameters established by AIG’s senior management. Well established market risk management techniques such as sensitivity analysis are used. Additionally, this department verifies that specific market risks of each of certain subsidiaries are managed and hedged by that subsidiary. ILFC is exposed to market risk and the risk of loss of fair value and possible liquidity strain resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates. As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, AIG statistically measured the loss of fair value through the application of a VaR model. In this analysis, the net fair value of Aircraft Finance operations was determined using the financial instrument assets which included the tax adjusted future flight equipment lease revenue, and the financial instrument liabilities which included the future servicing of the current debt. The estimated effect of the current derivative positions was also taken into account. AIG calculated the VaR with respect to the net fair value of Aircraft Finance operations using the historical simulation methodology, as previously described. As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the average VaR with respect to the net fair value of Aircraft Finance operations was approximately $70 million and $38 million, respectively. Capital Markets operations are exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices.'),\n",

To economically hedge interest rate risks, AIGFP may also purchase U.S. and foreign government obligations. AIGFP does not seek to manage the market risk of each transaction through an individual third party offsetting transaction. Rather, AIGFP takes a portfolio approach to the management of its market risk exposures. AIGFP values the predominant portion of its market-sensitive transactions by marking them to market currently through income. A smaller portion is priced by estimated fair value based upon a conservative extrapolation of market factors. There is another limited portion of transactions where changes in fair value are not recorded through income currently and gains or losses are accrued over the life of the transactions. These valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows and may include reserves for such risks as are deemed appropriate by AIGFP and AIG management. AIGFP manages market risk with a variety of transactions, including swaps, trading securities, futures and forward contracts, and other transactions as appropriate. The recorded values of these transactions may be different from the values that might be realized if AIGFP were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes that such differences are not significant to the results of operations,\\nFORM 10-K : 95\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nfinancial condition or liquidity. Such differences would be immediately recognized when the transactions are sold or closed out prior to maturity. AIGFP attempts to secure reliable and independent current market prices, such as published exchange prices, external subscription services such as from Bloomberg or Reuters or third-party broker quotes for use in this model. When such prices are not available, AIGFP uses an internal methodology which includes extrapolation from observable and verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions. Historically, actual results have not materially deviated from these models. Systems used by Capital Markets operations can monitor each unit’s respective market positions on an intraday basis. AIGFP operates in major business centers overseas and therefore is open for business essentially 24 hours a day. Thus, the market exposure and offset strategies are monitored, reviewed and coordinated around the clock. AIGFP applies various testing techniques which reflect significant potential market movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity and equity prices, volatility levels, and the effect of time. These techniques vary by currency and are regularly changed to reflect factors affecting the derivatives portfolio. The results from these analyses are regularly reviewed by AIG management. As described above, Capital Markets operations are exposed to the risk of loss of fair value from adverse fluctuations in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices as well as implied volatilities thereon. AIG statistically measures the losses of fair value through the application of a VaR model across Capital Markets. Capital Markets asset and liability portfolios for which the VaR analyses were performed included over the counter and exchange traded investments, derivative instruments and commodities. Because the market risk with respect to securities available for sale, at market, is substantially hedged, segregation of market sensitive instruments into trading and other than trading was not deemed necessary. The VaR calculation is unaffected by the accounting treatment of hedged transactions under FAS 133. In the calculation of VaR for Capital Markets operations, AIG uses the same historical simulation methodology, described under Insurance above, which entails repricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period. AIGFP has recently enhanced its library of factors by including implied option volatilities to construct the historical scenarios for simulation. The following table presents the VaR on a combined basis and of each component of risk for Capital Markets operations as of December 31, 2004 and 2003.

Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below. Consolidated financial statements and\\nfinancial statement schedules\\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of American International Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (AIG) at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of AIG’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, AIG restated its 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements. As described in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements, AIG changed the manner in which it accounts for certain non-traditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts as of January 1, 2004. Internal control over financial reporting\\nAlso, we have audited management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that AIG did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 because of the effect of the material weaknesses relating to the (1) control environment, (2) controls over the evaluation of risk transfer, (3) controls over certain balance sheet reconciliations, (4) controls over accounting for certain derivative transactions and (5) controls over income tax accounting based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). AIG’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of AIG’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of\\nFORM 10-K : 99\\nmanagement and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. As of December 31, 2004, the following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management’s assessment. Control environment: Certain of AIG’s controls within its control environment were not effective to prevent certain members of senior management, including the former Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Financial Officer, from having the ability, which in certain instances was utilized, to override certain controls and effect certain transactions and accounting entries. In certain of these instances, such transactions and accounting entries appear to have been largely motivated to achieve desired accounting results and were not properly accounted for in accordance with GAAP. Further, in certain of these instances, information critical to an effective review of transactions, accounting entries, and certain entities used in these transactions and accounting entries, were not disclosed to the appropriate financial and accounting personnel, regulators and AIG’s independent registered public accounting firm. As a result, discussion and thorough legal, accounting, actuarial or other professional analysis did not occur. This control deficiency is based primarily on these overrides. Specifically, this control deficiency permitted the following:\\n•\\nCreation of Capco, a special purpose entity used to effect transactions that were recorded to convert, improperly, underwriting losses to investment losses and that were not correctly accounted for in accordance with GAAP, resulting in a misstatement of premiums and other considerations, realized capital gains (losses), incurred policy losses and benefits and related balance sheet accounts. •\\nIncorrect recording under GAAP of reinsurance transactions that did not involve sufficient risk transfer, such as the Gen Re transaction, and in some cases also related to entities which should have been consolidated, such as Union Excess and Richmond. This incorrect recording under GAAP resulted in a misstatement of premiums and other considerations, incurred policy losses and benefits, net investment income, reinsurance assets, deferred policy acquisition costs, other assets, reserve for losses and loss expenses, reserve for unearned premiums, other liabilities and retained earnings. See below for a related discussion under Controls over the evaluation of risk transfer. •\\nVarious transactions, such as Covered Calls and certain “Top Level” Adjustments, converted realized and unrealized gains into investment income, thereby incorrectly applying GAAP, resulting in a misstatement of net investment income, realized capital gains (losses), and accumulated other comprehensive income. •\\nIncorrect recording under GAAP of changes to loss reserves and changes to loss reserves through “Top Level” Adjustments without adequate support, resulting in a misstatement of incurred policy losses and benefits, reserves for losses and loss expenses, foreign currency translation adjustments and retained earnings. Controls over the evaluation of risk transfer: AIG did not maintain effective controls over the proper evaluation, documentation and disclosure of whether certain insurance and reinsurance transactions involved sufficient risk transfer to qualify for insurance and reinsurance accounting. These transactions included Gen Re, Union Excess, Richmond and certain transactions involving AIG Re, AIG Risk Finance and AIG Risk Management. As a result, AIG did not properly account for these transactions under GAAP, resulting in a misstatement of premiums and other considerations, incurred policy losses and benefits, net investment income, reinsurance assets, deferred policy acquisition costs, other assets, reserve for losses and loss expenses, reserve for unearned premiums, other liabilities and retained earnings. Controls over certain balance sheet reconciliations: AIG did not maintain effective controls to ensure the accuracy of certain balance sheet accounts in certain key segments of AIG’s operations, principally in the Domestic Brokerage Group. Specifically, accounting personnel did not perform timely reconciliations and did not properly resolve reconciling items for premium receivables, reinsurance recoverables and intercompany accounts. As a result, insurance acquisition and other operating expenses, premiums and insurance balances receivable, reinsurance assets, other assets and retained earnings were misstated under GAAP. Controls over the accounting for certain derivative transactions: AIG did not maintain effective controls over the evaluation and documentation of whether certain derivative transactions qualified under GAAP for hedge accounting, resulting in a misstatement of net investment income, realized capital gains (losses), other revenues, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and related balance sheet accounts. 100 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nControls over income tax accounting: AIG did not maintain effective controls over the determination and reporting of certain components of the provision for income taxes and related deferred income tax balances. Specifically, AIG did not maintain effective controls to review and monitor the accuracy of the components of the income tax provision calculations and related deferred income taxes and to monitor the differences between the income tax basis and the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities to effectively reconcile the differences to the deferred income tax balances. As a result, deferred income taxes payable, retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income were misstated under GAAP. The control deficiencies described above resulted in the restatement of AIG’s 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000 annual consolidated financial statements and 2004 and 2003 interim consolidated financial statements, as well as adjustments, including audit adjustments relating to the derivative matter described above, to AIG’s 2004 annual consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, these control deficiencies could result in other misstatements in financial statement accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim AIG consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, management has concluded that these control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses. These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2004 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of AIG’s internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, management’s assessment that AIG did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. Also, in our opinion, because of the effects of the material weaknesses described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, AIG has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.

Acquisition costs represent those costs, including commissions and premium taxes, that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new business. These costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums written are earned. The deferred policy acquisition cost (DAC) asset is reviewed for recoverability based on the profitability of the underlying insurance contracts. Investment income is not anticipated in the recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs. Losses and loss expenses are charged to income as incurred. The reserve for losses and loss expenses represents the accumulation of estimates for reported losses and includes provisions for losses incurred but not reported. The methods of determining such estimates and establishing resulting reserves, including amounts relating to reserves for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance, are reviewed and updated. Adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in income currently. AIG discounts its loss reserves relating to workers compensation business written by its U.S. domiciled subsidiaries as permitted by the domiciliary statutory regulatory authorities. As of year end 2004, this discount is $399 million on a tabular basis and $503 million on a non-tabular basis. Additionally, AIG discounts liability business assumed by AIRCO from DBG as permitted by its domiciliary regulatory authority. As of year end 2004, this discount is $651 million. The total amount of discount is $1.55 billion or less than three percent of outstanding loss reserves as reflected on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Life Insurance & Retirement Services Operations: AIG’s Life Insurance & Retirement Services subsidiaries offer a wide range of insurance and retirement savings products both domestically and abroad. Insurance-oriented products consist of individual and group life, payout annuities, endowment, and accident and health policies. Retirement savings-oriented products generally consist of fixed and variable annuities. Premiums for life insurance products and life contingent annuities are recognized as revenues when due. Estimates for premiums due but not yet collected are accrued. Benefits and expenses are provided against such revenues to recognize profits over the estimated life of the policies. Revenues for universal life and investment-type products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, administration, and surrenders during the period. Policy charges collected with respect to future services are deferred and recognized in a manner similar to the deferred policy acquisition costs related to such products. Expenses include interest credited to policy account balances and benefit payments made in excess of policy account balances. Personal accident products are accounted for in a manner similar to general insurance products described above. Policy acquisition costs for life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period of the policy (FAS 60). Policy acquisition costs and policy issuance costs related to universal life and investment-type products (investment-oriented products) are deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts (FAS 97). Estimated gross profits are composed of net interest income, net realized investment gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses, and mortality and morbidity gains and losses. The resulting DAC asset is reviewed for recoverability based on the profitability (both current and projected future) of the underlying insurance contracts. The deferred policy acquisition costs for investment-oriented products are adjusted with respect to estimated gross profits as a result of changes in the net unrealized gains or losses on debt and equity securities available for sale. That is,\\nFORM 10-K : 109\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\\nas debt and equity securities available for sale are carried at aggregate fair value, an adjustment is made to deferred policy acquisition costs equal to the change in amortization that would have been recorded if such securities had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields. The change in this adjustment, net of tax, is included with the change in net unrealized gains/losses on debt and equity securities available for sale that is credited or charged directly to comprehensive income. Deferred policy acquisition costs have been decreased by $2.26 billion at December 31, 2004 and decreased by $2.05 billion at December 31, 2003 for this adjustment. See also Note 4 herein. Value of Business Acquired (VOBA) is determined at time of acquisition. This value is based on present value of future pre-tax profits discounted at current yields applicable at time of purchase. For products accounted under FAS 60, the VOBA is amortized over the life of the business similar to that for Deferred Acquisition Costs based on the assumptions at purchase. For FAS 97 products, the VOBA is amortized in relation to the estimated gross profits to date for each period. No impairments have occurred for acquired business to date.'),\n",

Financial Services: AIG’s Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified activities including aircraft leasing, capital market transactions, and consumer and insurance premium financing. Aircraft Finance operations represent the operations of ILFC, which engages primarily in the acquisition of commercial jet aircraft and the leasing and remarketing of such aircraft to airlines around the world. ILFC also provides, for a fee, fleet management services to certain third-party operators. ILFC, as lessor, leases flight equipment principally under operating leases. Accordingly, income is recognized over the life of the lease as rentals become receivable under the provisions of the lease or, in the case of leases with varying payments, under the straight-line method over the noncancelable term of the lease. In certain cases, leases provide for additional payments contingent on usage. Rental income is recognized at the time such usage occurs less a provision for future contractual aircraft maintenance. ILFC is also a remarketer of flight equipment for its own account and for airlines and financial institutions and provides, for a fee, fleet management services to certain third-party operators. ILFC’s revenues from such operations consist of net gains on sales of flight equipment and commissions. During the third quarter of 2003, AIG integrated the operations of AIG Trading Group Inc. with AIG Financial Products Corp., establishing the Capital Markets reporting unit. AIGFP engages as principal in standard and customized interest rate, currency, equity, commodity, and credit products with top-tier corporations, financial institutions, governments, agencies, institutional investors, and high-net-worth individuals throughout the world. AIGFP also raises funds through municipal reinvestment contracts and other private and public securities offerings, investing the proceeds in a diversified portfolio of high grade securities and derivative transactions. AIGFP engages in various commodity and foreign exchange trading and market-making activities. AIGFP owns inventories in the commodities in which it trades and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the use of swaps, forwards, futures, and option contracts. See also Note 3 herein.

Certain costs incurred in the sale of mutual funds are deferred and subsequently amortized. (c) Investments in Fixed Maturities and Equity Securities: Bonds held to maturity are principally owned by the insurance subsidiaries and are carried at amortized cost where AIG has the ability and positive intent to hold these securities until maturity. Where AIG may not have the positive intent to hold bonds and preferred stocks until maturity, these securities are considered to be available for sale and carried at current market values. Interest income with respect to fixed maturity securities is accrued as earned. Premiums and discounts arising from the purchase of bonds are treated as yield adjustments over their estimated lives, or call date if applicable. Bond trading securities are carried at current market values, as it is AIG’s intention to sell these securities in the near term. Common and preferred stocks are carried at current market values. Dividend income is generally recognized when receivable. Unrealized gains and losses from investments in equity securities and fixed maturities available for sale are reflected as a separate component of comprehensive income, net of deferred income taxes in consolidated shareholders’ equity currently. Unrealized gains and losses from investments in trading securities are reflected in income currently. Realized capital gains and losses are determined principally by specific identification. AIG evaluates its investments for impairment. As a matter of policy, the determination that a security has incurred an other-than-temporary decline in value and the amount of any loss recognition requires the judgment of AIG’s management and a continual review of its investments. In general, a security is considered a candidate for impairment if it meets any of the following criteria:\\n•\\nTrading at a significant (25 percent or more) discount to par, amortized cost (if lower) or cost for an extended period of time (nine months or longer);\\n•\\nThe occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in (i) the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation; or (ii) the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for the court supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprises; or (iii) the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value of their claims; or\\n•\\nIn the opinion of AIG’s management, it is possible that AIG may not realize a full recovery on its investment, irrespective of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events. Once a security has been identified as impaired, the amount of such impairment is determined by reference to that security’s contemporaneous market price and recorded as a charge to earnings. AIG also enters into dollar roll agreements. These are agreements to sell mortgage-backed securities and to repurchase substantially similar securities at a specified price and date in the future. At December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, there were no dollar roll agreements outstanding. (d) Mortgage Loans on Real Estate, Policy, and Collateral Loans - net: Mortgage loans on real estate, policy loans, and collateral loans are carried at unpaid principal balances. Interest income on such loans is accrued as earned. Impairment of mortgage loans on real estate and collateral loans is based upon certain risk factors and when collection of all amounts due under the contractual term is not probable. This impairment is generally measured based on the\\nFORM 10-K : 111\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\\npresent value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate subject to the fair value of underlying collateral. Interest income on such loans is recognized as cash is received. There is no allowance for policy loans, as these loans serve to reduce the death benefit paid when the death claim is made and the balances are effectively collateralized by the cash surrender value of the policy.

Under the provisions of most leases for certain airframe and engine overhauls, the lessee is reimbursed for costs incurred up to but not exceeding contingent rentals paid to AIG by the lessee. AIG provides a charge to income for such reimbursements based upon the expected reimbursements during the life of the lease. Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line basis to a residual value of approximately 15 percent over the estimated useful lives of the related assets but not exceeding 25 years. AIG monitors the global aircraft market and the values of various types and models of aircraft within that market relative to the values of its own fleet. If events or circumstances were such that the carrying amount of AIG’s aircraft might be impaired, AIG would determine if such impairment existed and recognize such impairment in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”\\nThis caption also includes deposits for aircraft to be purchased. At the time the assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the related accounts and the difference, net of proceeds, is recorded as a gain or loss. (f) Financial Services - Securities Available for Sale, at market value: These securities are held to meet long-term investment objectives and are accounted for as available for sale, carried at current market values and recorded on a trade date basis. This portfolio is hedged using interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity and equity derivatives. The market risk associated with such hedges is managed on a portfolio basis, with third party hedging transactions executed as necessary. As hedge accounting treatment is not achieved in accordance with FAS 133, the unrealized gains and losses on these securities resulting from changes in interest rates, currency rates and equity prices are recorded in consolidated shareholders’ equity while the unrealized gains and losses on the related economic hedges are reflected in operating income. (g) Financial Services - Trading Securities, at market value: Trading securities are held to meet short term investment objectives, including hedging securities. These securities are recorded on a trade-date basis and carried at current market values. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in income currently. (h) Financial Services - Spot Commodities, at market value: Spot commodities are carried at current market values and are recorded on a trade-date basis. The exposure to market risk may be reduced through the use of forwards, futures and option contracts. Unrealized gains and losses from commodities and derivative transactions are reflected in income currently. (i) Financial Services - Unrealized Gain and Unrealized Loss on Swaps, Options and Forward Transactions: Interest rate, currency, equity and commodity swaps, swaptions, options and forward transactions are accounted for as contractual commitments recorded on a trade-date basis and are carried at current market values or estimated fair values when market values are not available. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in income currently, where appropriate. In certain instances, income is recognized over the life of the contract. Estimated fair values are based on the use of valuation models that utilize, among other things, current interest, foreign exchange, equity, commodity and volatility rates. AIG attempts to secure reliable and independent current market prices, such as published exchange prices, external subscription services’ prices such as Bloomberg or Reuters or third-party broker quotes for use in these models. When such prices are not available, AIG uses an internal methodology which includes extrapolation from observable and verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions. These valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows of these transactions and reflect market and credit risk. The portfolio’s discounted cash flows are evaluated with reference to current market conditions, maturities within the portfolio, and other relevant factors. Based upon this evaluation, it is determined what offsetting transactions, if any, are necessary to reduce the market risk of the portfolio. AIG manages its market risk with a variety of transactions, including swaps, trading securities, futures and forward contracts and other transactions as appropriate. Because of the limited liquidity of some of these instruments, the recorded values of these transactions may be different from the values that might be realized if AIG were to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes that such differences are not significant to the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Such differences would be immediately recognized in income when the transactions are sold or closed out prior to maturity. 112 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc.'),\n",

Options are carried at fair values based on the use of valuation models that utilize, among other things, current interest or commodity rates, and foreign exchange and volatility rates, as applicable. (k) Financial Services - Securities Purchased (Sold) Under Agreements to Resell (Repurchase), at contract value: Purchases of securities under agreements to resell and sales of securities under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized lending transactions and are recorded at their contracted resale or repurchase amounts, plus accrued interest. Generally, AIG’s policy is to take possession of or obtain a security interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell. AIG minimizes the credit risk that counterparties to transactions might be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations by monitoring customer credit exposure and collateral value and generally requiring additional collateral to be deposited with AIG when deemed necessary. (l) Financial Services - Finance Receivables: Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, plus unamortized fees, net of an allowance. (m) Securities Lending Collateral and Securities Lending Payable: AIG’s insurance and asset management operations lend their securities and primarily take cash as collateral with respect to the securities lent. Income earned on invested collateral, net of interest payable to the collateral provider, is recorded in net investment income. The market value of securities pledged under securities lending arrangements were $48.8 billion and $29.5 billion as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Of these amounts, $48.2 billion and $29.3 billion represent securities included in the bonds available for sale caption in AIG’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (n) Other Invested Assets: Other invested assets consist primarily of investments by AIG’s insurance operations in hedge funds and limited partnerships. Hedge funds and limited partnerships in which AIG holds in the aggregate less than a five percent interest are carried at fair value. The change in fair value is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. With respect to hedge funds and limited partnerships in which AIG holds in the aggregate a five percent or greater interest, AIG’s carrying value is the net asset value. The changes in such net asset values are recorded in earnings through net investment income. AIG obtains the fair value of its investments in limited partnerships and hedge funds from information provided by the general partner or manager of each of these investments, the accounts of which are generally audited on an annual basis. (o) Reinsurance Assets: Reinsurance assets include the balances due from both reinsurance and insurance companies under the terms of AIG’s reinsurance agreements for paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses, ceded unearned premiums and ceded future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and benefits paid and unpaid. Amounts related to paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses with respect to these reinsurance agreements are substantially collateralized. (p) Deposit Liabilities: AIG has entered into certain insurance and reinsurance contracts, primarily in its general insurance segment, which do not contain sufficient amount and timing risk to be accounted for as insurance or reinsurance. Accordingly, these transactions are recorded based upon deposit accounting, and the premiums received, after deduction for certain related expenses, are recorded as deposits within Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Net proceeds of these deposits are invested and generate net investment income. As amounts are paid, consistent with the underlying contracts, the deposit liability is reduced. Periodically, AIG evaluates the expected payments to be made under each contract and adjusts the deposit liability through earnings in the current period. (q) Investments in Partially Owned Companies: Generally, the equity method of accounting is used for AIG’s investment in companies in which AIG’s ownership interest approximates\\nFORM 10-K : 113\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\\n20 percent but is not greater than 50 percent (minority owned companies). At December 31, 2004, AIG’s significant investments in partially owned companies included its 24.3 percent interest in IPC Holdings, Ltd., its 23.4 percent interest in Allied World Assurance Holdings, Ltd. and its 24.5 percent interest in The Fuji Fire and Marine Insurance Co., Ltd. This balance sheet caption also includes investments in less significant partially owned companies and in certain minor majority owned subsidiaries. The amounts of dividends received from unconsolidated entities owned less than 50 percent were $21 million, $12 million and $12 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The undistributed earnings of unconsolidated entities owned less than 50 percent was $403 million, $283 million and $155 million as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. (r) Real Estate and Other Fixed Assets: The costs of buildings and furniture and equipment are depreciated principally on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (maximum of 40 years for buildings and ten years for furniture and equipment). Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred; expenditures for betterments are capitalized and depreciated. From time to time, AIG assesses the carrying value of its real estate relative to the market values of real estate within the specific local area, for the purpose of determining any asset impairment. (s) Separate and Variable Accounts: Separate and variable accounts represent funds for which investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to the policyholders who predominantly bear the investment risk. Each account has specific investment objectives, and the assets are carried at market value. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims which arise out of any other business of AIG. The liabilities for these accounts are generally equal to the account assets. (t) Financial Services - Securities and Spot Commodities Sold but not yet Purchased, at market value: Securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased represent sales of securities and spot commodities not owned at the time of sale. The obligations arising from such transactions are recorded on a trade-date basis and carried at the respective current market values or current commodity prices.'),\n",

Under FAS 52, functional currency assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars generally using current rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date of each respective subsidiary and the related translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of comprehensive income, net of any related taxes, in consolidated shareholders’ equity. Functional currencies are generally the currencies of the local operating environment. Income statement accounts expressed in functional currencies are translated using average exchange rates. The adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign entities operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in income. Exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recorded in income currently.

The number of shares excluded were 7 million, 26 million and 9 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. (z) Derivatives: AIG carries all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The financial statement recognition of the change in the fair value of a derivative depends on a number of factors, including the intended use of the derivative and the extent to which it is effective as part of a hedge transaction. The changes in fair value of the derivative transactions of AIGFP are currently presented as a component of AIG’s operating income. However, in certain instances income is recognized over the life of the contract, where appropriate. The discussion below relates to the derivative activities of AIG (other than those of AIGFP) that qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133. (See also Note 2 “Other GAAP Corrections - Accounting for Derivatives (FAS 133 Hedge Accounting)”). For derivatives designated as hedges, on the date the derivative contract is entered into, AIG designates the derivative as: (i) a hedge of the subsequent changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (“fair value” hedge); (ii) a hedge of a forecasted transaction, or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow” hedge); or (iii) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Fair value and cash flow hedges may involve foreign currencies (“foreign currency hedges”). The gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative that is appropriately and contemporaneously documented, designated and is highly effective as a fair value hedge is recorded in current period earnings, along with the loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative that is appropriately\\nFORM 10-K : 115\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\\nand contemporaneously documented, designated and is highly effective as a cash flow hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows. The gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative that is appropriately and contemporaneously documented, designated and is highly effective as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustments account within other comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of derivatives used for other than hedging activities are reported in current period earnings (principally in realized capital gains and losses for AIG’s insurance operations). AIG appropriately and contemporaneously documented relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet, specific firm commitments, or forecasted transactions. AIG also assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. In addition to hedging activities, AIG also uses derivative instruments with respect to investment operations, which include, among other things, credit default swaps, and purchasing investments with embedded derivatives, such as equity linked notes and convertible bonds. All changes in the market value of these derivatives are recorded in earnings. AIG bifurcates an embedded derivative where: (i) the economic characteristics of the embedded instruments are not clearly and closely related to those of the remaining components of the financial instrument; and (ii) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument meets the definition of a derivative under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” See also Note 20 herein. (aa) Goodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that a possible impairment has occurred. The assessment of impairment involves a two-step process whereby an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed, followed by a measurement of the amount of impairment, if any.'),\n",

On August 29, 2003, AIG acquired 100 percent of the outstanding common shares of GE Edison Life Insurance Company in Japan and the U.S.-based auto and home insurance business of General Electric Company (GE) for $2.1 billion. The acquisition expanded AIG’s life insurance presence in Japan and AIG’s auto and home insurance presence in the U.S. At the date of acquisition, the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were $20 billion and $19 billion, respectively. Goodwill associated with this transaction as of December 31, 2003 amounted to $1.3 billion, primarily related to the life business. Other changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are primarily caused as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments and other purchase price adjustments. (bb) Recent Accounting Standards: In December 2003, FASB issued Interpretation No. 46R, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities Revised” (FIN46R). See also Notes 2 and 19 herein. In March 2005, FASB issued FSP FIN46R-5 “Implicit Variable Interests under FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (FSP FIN46R-5) to address whether a reporting enterprise has an implicit variable interest in a variable interest entity (VIE) or potential VIE when specific conditions exist. Although implicit variable interests are mentioned in FIN46R, the term is not defined and only one example is provided. FSP FIN46R-5 offers additional guidance, stating that implicit variable interests are implied financial interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets exclusive of variable interests. An implicit variable interest acts the same as an explicit variable interest except it involves the absorbing and/or receiving of variability indirectly from the entity (rather than directly). The identification of an implicit variable interest is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances. FSP FIN46R-5 is effective for the second quarter of 2005, and AIG is currently assessing the effect, if any, of FSP FIN46R-5. In July 2003, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position 03-1, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts” (SOP 03-1). See also Note 21 herein. In December 2003, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132 (Revised), “Employers’ Disclosures About Pensions and Other Post Retirement Benefits,” which revised disclosure requirements with respect to defined benefit plans.

The adoption of Issue No. 04-8 did not have a material effect on AIG’s diluted EPS. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123 (revised 2004) (FAS 123R), “Share-Based Payment.” FAS 123R replaces FASB Statement No. 123 (FAS 123), “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” FAS 123, as originally issued in 1995, established as preferable a fair-value-based method of accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees. On January 1, 2003, AIG adopted the recognition provisions of FAS 123. See also Note 14 herein. In April 2005, the SEC delayed the effective date for FAS 123R until the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, AIG expects to adopt the provisions of the revised FAS 123R in the first quarter of 2006. AIG is currently assessing the effect of FAS 123R and believes the effect will not be material to AIG’s results of operations. In March 2005, FASB issued FSP No. 46(R)-5, “Implicit Variable Interests under FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”, or FSP FIN 46R-5. FSP FIN 46R-5 provides guidance for a reporting enterprise on whether it holds an implicit variable interest in VIEs or potential VIEs when specific conditions exist. This FSP is effective in the first period beginning after March 3, 2005 in accordance with the transition provisions of FIN 46R. AIG is currently assessing the effect of the adoption of FSP FIN 46R-5 on results of operations and financial condition and does not expect it to have a material impact. (cc) Fourth Quarter 2004 Changes in Estimates: The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make extensive use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Examples of some of the significant estimates in AIG’s financial statements include estimation of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, deferred acquisition costs, allowances for reinsurance recoverable, estimation of future cash flows for use in evaluating asset valuation and potential asset impairments, loss contingencies, fair value of financial instruments, income tax provisions and tax valuation reserves and various assumptions with regard to the valuation of pension and other post-retirement employee benefit expenses. AIG’s internal review was complemented by investigations by outside counsel for AIG and for the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm (PwC or independent auditors) was consulted on the scope of the internal review for certain matters and reviewed the results of the internal review. As a result of the findings of the internal review, together with the results of investigations conducted by outside counsel at the request of AIG’s Audit Committee and in consultation with PwC, AIG has concluded that the accounting for certain transactions and certain relationships needs to be restated or adjusted. See Note 2 herein - “Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements”. In connection with the internal review previously described, AIG has made extensive evaluation of information used in the preparation of certain estimates made in completing the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004. These estimates were reflected in the previously released unaudited results of operations disclosed in AIG’s press release furnished in its Current Report on Form 8-K dated February 9, 2005. Management believes that the additional information now available provides additional evidence about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date that have\\nFORM 10-K : 117\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\\ncome to management’s attention prior to the release of the Company’s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004. Accordingly, certain fourth quarter 2004 estimates were revised to reflect the financial statement effect of the additional information upon management’s estimates. The following table summarizes the more significant of the fourth quarter changes in estimates:\\n2. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial\\nStatements\\nIn connection with the preparation of AIG’s consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, AIG’s current management initiated an internal review of AIG’s books and records, which was substantially expanded in mid-March. The following provides a description of the internal review process, details of the accounting adjustments included in the restatement of AIG’s consolidated financial statements and the effect of the adjustments on AIG’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2003 and its Consolidated Statement of Income and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. Internal Review. The internal review, conducted under the direction of current senior management with the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, spanned AIG’s major business units globally, and included a review of information and a number of transactions from 2000 to the present. In certain cases, items in periods prior to 2000 were examined due to the nature of the transactions under review. The business units subject to review were Domestic General Insurance, Foreign General Insurance, Reinsurance, Financial Services, Domestic and Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services and Asset Management. The internal review encompassed AIG’s books and records, thousands of files and e-mails and interviews with current and former employees and members of management. Management believes that the scope and process of its internal review was sufficient to identify issues of a material nature that could affect AIG’s financial statements. AIG’s internal review was complemented by investigations by outside counsel for AIG and for the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm (PwC or independent auditors), was consulted on the scope of the internal review for certain matters and reviewed the results of the internal review. As a result of the findings of the internal review, together with the results of investigations conducted by outside counsel at the request of AIG’s Audit Committee and in consultation with AIG’s independent auditors, AIG has concluded that the accounting for certain transactions and certain relationships needs to be restated.'),\n",

AIG has restated its Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2003 and its Consolidated Statement of Income and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 as well as the quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2004 and 2003 and the quarter ended December 31, 2003 included herein. AIG’s previously issued financial statements for these periods should no longer be relied upon. See below for a reconciliation of certain previously reported amounts to the restated amounts. As part of its internal review, AIG evaluated the financial reporting consolidation process and the resulting financial statements as well as the appropriateness of AIG’s prior accounting and reporting decisions. Based on this evaluation, the restatement includes corrections of errors in current or prior accounting periods for improper or inappropriate transactions or entries identified by the review. In many cases these transactions or entries appear to have had the purpose of achieving an accounting result that would enhance measures\\n118 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\n2. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial\\nStatements (continued)\\nbelieved to be important to the financial community and may have involved documentation that did not accurately reflect the true nature of the arrangements. In certain instances, these transactions or entries may also have involved misrepresentations to members of management, regulators and AIG’s independent auditors. The restatement includes adjustments, some of which had been previously identified but considered not to be sufficiently material to require correction. Details of Accounting Adjustments included in the Restatement. The accounting adjustments relate primarily to the categories described below. Many of the adjustments that do not affect previously reported net income or consolidated shareholders’ equity do, however, change both the consolidated and business segment reporting of premiums, underwriting results, net investment income, realized capital gains and losses and operating income, as well as other items. Adjustments that affect reported net income and consolidated shareholders’ equity relate to both the timing and recognition of revenues and expenses and affect the comparison of period-to-period results. Following the description of each transaction, accounting entry or entity category is a summary of the principal consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts affected by the adjustments relating to that category. •\\nRisk Transfer. To recognize the cash flows under an insurance contract as premium and losses, GAAP requires the transfer of risk. If risk transfer requirements are not met, an insurance contract is accounted for as a deposit, resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract as deposit assets or liabilities and not as revenues or expense. AIG has concluded, based upon its internal review, that there was insufficient risk transfer to qualify for insurance accounting for certain transactions where AIG subsidiaries either wrote direct insurance or assumed or ceded reinsurance. These transactions are now recorded using deposit accounting.'),\n",

Eliminating the cessions reduces reinsurance assets, effectively eliminates the inherent discount related to the loss reserves ceded under the contracts, and increases net premiums and losses. In addition, as a result of certain facts and circumstances related to the formation of Union Excess, as well as certain relationships with Starr International Company, Inc. (SICO), Union Excess is now included in AIG’s consolidated financial statements. The facts and circumstances surrounding SICO’s involvement with Union Excess were not properly reflected in AIG’s books and records, were not known to all relevant AIG financial reporting personnel and, AIG now believes, were not known to AIG’s independent auditors. For example, a significant portion of the ownership interests of Union Excess shareholders are protected against loss under financial arrangements with SICO. Additionally, from its formation in 1991, Union Excess has reinsured risks emanating primarily or solely from AIG subsidiaries, both directly and indirectly. Further, it appears that the employees responsible for the reinsurance related to Union Excess managed that relationship to prevent signifi-\\ncant losses or gains to Union Excess so that substantially all of the risks and rewards of the underlying reinsurance inured to AIG. This relationship allowed AIG to absorb substantially all the economic returns, which in turn caused Union Excess to be deemed a variable interest entity (VIE). The effect of the restatement relating to Union Excess on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts is as follows:\\n-\\nGen Re: In December 2000 and March 2001, an AIG subsidiary entered into an assumed reinsurance transaction with a subsidiary of General Re Corporation (Gen Re) involving two tranches of $250 million each. In connection with each tranche, consolidated net premiums written and consolidated incurred policy losses and benefits increased by $250 million in the fourth quarter of 2000 (with respect to the first tranche) and the first quarter of 2001 (with\\nFORM 10-K : 119\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n2. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial\\nStatements (continued)\\nrespect to the second tranche). The first tranche of the transaction was commuted in November 2004, reducing premiums and reserves for losses and loss expenses by approximately $250 million in the fourth quarter 2004. AIG has concluded that the transaction was done to accomplish a desired accounting result and did not entail sufficient qualifying risk transfer. As a result, AIG has determined that the transaction should not have been recorded as insurance. AIG’s restated financial statements recharacterize the transaction as a deposit rather than as insurance. Such recharacterization had virtually no effect on net income or consolidated shareholders’ equity but had the following effect on AIG’s consolidated balance sheet accounts:\\n-\\nOther Risk Transfer: AIG has concluded that Richmond Insurance Company, Ltd., a Bermuda-based reinsurance holding company (Richmond) in which AIG currently holds a 19.9 percent ownership interest, should be treated as a consolidated entity in AIG’s financial statements due to AIG’s ability to exert control over that entity. Such determination was based, in part, on arrangements and documents, including put agreements requiring an AIG subsidiary to purchase the Richmond shares, that appear not to have been previously disclosed to appropriate AIG financial personnel or AIG’s independent auditors. Although AIG currently owns only a minority ownership interest in Richmond, a review of the operations of Richmond and its subsidiaries has shown significant previously undisclosed evidence of AIG control causing Richmond to be deemed a VIE. The consolidation of Richmond had virtually no effect on net income or consolidated shareholders’ equity. AIG has received notice of exercise of a put with respect to 49.9 percent of the Richmond shares and expects to acquire the shares by June 30, 2005. As a result of its internal review of AIG Re, AIG Risk Finance and AIG Risk Management and certain transactions, AIG determined that adjustments were required because certain transactions lacked sufficient risk transfer to qualify for insurance accounting under GAAP. The effect of the restatement for Richmond, AIG Re, AIG Risk Finance, AIG Risk Management and certain other transactions on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts is as follows:\\n•\\nLoss Reserves: Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses is a complex process requiring the use of assumptions which may be highly uncertain at the time of estimation. As a result of its internal review, AIG has determined that the IBNR included in the General Insurance reserve for losses and loss expenses was adjusted on a regular basis without appropriate support for the changes requested to be made. Although AIG does not believe that any change materially affected the integrity of AIG’s loss reserve position because in each instance IBNR as adjusted was determined to be within an appropriate tolerance of the applicable actuarial point estimate, AIG has determined that the unsupported decreases in reserves generated independently from the actuarial process constituted errors which should be corrected and has restated the amounts of carried reserves accordingly. As a result, the fourth quarter 2002 charge relating to the increase in the General Insurance reserve for losses and loss expenses, previously reported as $2.8 billion, has been restated to $2.1 billion to reduce the original charge by the cumulative effect of the correction of the unsupported adjustments to reserves through that date (approximately $700 million). Therefore, the charge to pretax earnings is approximately $700 million less than previously reported, reflecting the removal of the unsupported adjustments to reserves in periods prior to and including the fourth quarter of 2002. The effect of the restatement of the loss reserves on\\n120 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc.'),\n",

Restatement of Previously Issued Financial\\nStatements (continued)\\ncertain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts is set forth as follows:\\n•\\nNet Investment Income. As a result of the internal review, AIG determined that the accounting for certain transactions had the effect of improperly converting capital gains into net investment income and was not consistent with GAAP. The most significant of these transactions are:\\n-\\nCovered Calls: From 2001 through 2003, certain AIG subsidiaries entered into a series of transactions with third parties whereby these subsidiaries sold in-the-money calls, principally on municipal bonds in their investment portfolios that had unrealized appreciation associated with them. Upon exercise of a call, the related bonds were delivered to the purchaser of the call and subsequently reacquired by the subsidiaries pursuant to contingent forward agreements which permitted the AIG subsidiaries to repurchase the bonds at the prevailing market value. In connection with selling the calls, the AIG subsidiaries also entered into interest rate swaps to protect them against the effects of changes in value of the applicable bonds as a result of movements in interest rates during the transaction period. These transactions were accounted for as sales and subsequent purchases and appear to have been initiated to increase net investment income. AIG has determined that, because AIG was able to cause the bonds to be returned from the third parties even after the third parties exercised the call options, AIG did not cede control over the bonds and therefore the transactions should not have been accounted for as sales and subsequent purchases but rather as financings. The adjustments required to correct this error reduce previously reported amounts of net investment income and correspondingly increase realized capital gains from these transactions over the three-year period. The restatement had no net effect on consolidated shareholders’ equity for any period and the following effects on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income accounts:\\n-\\nSynthetic Fuel Investment: AIG subsidiaries invest in certain limited liability companies that invest in synthetic fuel production facilities as a means of generating income tax credits. As a result of a misapplication of GAAP, AIG recorded net investment income or, in some cases, other revenues, on a pretax basis rather than reflecting the tax credit as a reduction of income tax expense, thereby increasing net investment income for AIG’s life insurance and retirement services segment and other revenues for the financial services segment. Certain of these entries were previously identified but not corrected as the amounts were viewed as not sufficiently material to require correction. In the fourth quarter of 2004, AIG changed its accounting to present these tax credits as a component of income taxes. AIG has now determined that it is necessary to record these adjustments for the periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2004. The restatement had no effect on consolidated net income or shareholders’ equity but had the following effects on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income accounts:\\nFORM 10-K : 121\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n2. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial\\nStatements (continued)\\n-\\nHedge Fund Accounting: AIG subsidiaries invest in a variety of alternative asset classes, including hedge fund limited partnerships, that are accounted for as available for sale securities. As part of the underlying partnership agreements, such AIG subsidiaries have the right to redeem their interests at defined times. A redemption allows AIG to record net investment income to the extent there are gains in the underlying funds at the time. However, as a result of its internal review, AIG has determined that, in certain cases, the redemption resulted in inappropriate gain recognition because the proceeds were required to be immediately reinvested in the funds. In addition, the cost bases of certain funds were misallocated in determining gains. The restated consolidated financial statements correct these errors. These corrections had virtually no effect on consolidated shareholders’ equity but had the following effects on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income accounts. -\\nMuni Tender Option Bond Program: From 2000 through early 2003, AIG subsidiaries participated in a program in which they transferred highly rated municipal bonds at market value to a third-party broker, which in turn transferred these securities to a trust that the broker had established. The trust then issued two sets of beneficial interests.'),\n",

The remaining beneficial interests were “inverse” floating interest rate certificates. Third parties invested in the floating interest rate certificates, and AIG subsidiaries invested in the inverse floating interest rate certificates. AIG did not consolidate the trust into AIG’s balance sheet. The AIG subsidiaries, as the holders of the residual interest inverse floating rate certificates, had the right to unilaterally liquidate the trust and cause the municipal bonds to be returned to AIG on short notice. Accordingly, the AIG subsidiaries did not cede control over the bonds. As a result, AIG now believes that the conclusion not to consolidate was an error in the application of GAAP. Therefore, AIG has now consolidated the trusts into its balance sheets. Because the program was discontinued in early 2003 there was no effect on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003: The consolidations had no effect on consolidated shareholders’ equity but had the following effects on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income accounts:\\n-\\nDBG/AIG Capital Corporation Intercompany Dividend: In 2002, AIG Capital Corporation issued shares of its preferred stock to National Union in exchange for shares of ILFC’s common stock. AIG did not eliminate the preferred stock investment in consolidation, instead recording the dividend as income in net investment income and as corresponding expense in other operating expenses. AIG has now determined that this accounting is a misapplication of GAAP. Accordingly, AIG has eliminated this intercompany investment and reversed the accounting entries in its consolidated statement of income. The restatement had no effect on consolidated net income or shareholders’ equity but had the following effects on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income accounts:\\n•\\n“Top Level” Adjustments and Other Directed Entries (other than loss reserves). Certain accounting entries originated at the parent company level had the effect of reclassifying realized capital gains to net investment income, as well as adjusting other line item reclassifications and other segment financial information. In some cases, expense deferrals were increased or reserves decreased, both having the effect of increasing reported earnings. In other\\n122 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\n2. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial\\nStatements (continued)\\ncases, the adjustments affected revenue and expense recognition between reporting periods or among business segments. Certain of these entries were previously identified but considered not to be sufficiently material to require correction. As part of its internal review, AIG analyzed and assessed “top level” adjustments since 2000 and determined that certain entries appear to have been made at the direction of certain former members of senior management without appropriate documentation or support. -\\nForeign Life Insurance Net Investment Income Reclassification: In addition to the matters described above, certain accounting entries, now determined to be errors, had the effect of reclassifying capital gains realized from investments made to match liabilities relating to policies in Japan and Southeast Asia. Due to the limited availability of long-duration bonds or bonds with sufficient yield to meet the policyholder liability requirements in Japan and Southeast Asia, AIG subsidiaries made alternative investments, including investments in equities. Until the fourth quarter of 2003, a portion of the capital gains realized on these alternative investments, including substantial amounts related to the sale of fixed income securities, was reclassified to net investment income in the consolidated statement of income to match these revenues against the incurred policy benefit expense of the underlying policies. Amounts so reflected, which were previously identified but not corrected as they were viewed as immaterial, are treated as corrections of errors in the restated financial statements, and are as follows: $448 million and $278 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively. Beginning in the first quarter of 2004, a process was implemented to identify only certain equity-related gains in Southeast Asia and a limited amount of fixed income and equity gains in Japan and to segregate and treat such realized capital gains separately for segment reporting purposes only. The new process and limits were applied retroactively for 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000 as part of the restatement. The restatement reverses all such unsupported “top level” and other directed entries, including the Foreign Life Insurance Net Investment Income Reclassification, with the following effect on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts:\\n•\\nConversion of Underwriting Losses to Capital Losses. This category includes transactions and entries that had the principal effect of improperly recharacterizing underwriting losses as capital losses. This category also includes insurance and reinsurance transactions where AIG’s accounting resulted in errors relating to the timing and classification of income recognition as well as errors relating to the timing of premium recognition. The most significant transactions in this category are the following:\\n-\\nCapco: AIG has determined that a series of transactions with Capco Reinsurance Company, Ltd. (Capco), a Barbados-domiciled reinsurer, involved an improper structure created to recharacterize underwriting losses relating to auto warranty business as capital losses. That structure, which appears to have not been properly disclosed to appropriate AIG personnel or its independent auditors, consisted primarily of arrangements between subsidiaries of AIG and Capco that require Capco to be treated as a consolidated entity in AIG’s financial statements. The result of such consolidation is to reverse capital losses for the years 2000 through 2003 and recognize a corresponding amount of underwriting losses in 2000. -\\nThe Robert Plan: AIG has restated the accounting for surplus notes purchased as part of a litigation settlement in 2002 with The Robert Plan Corporation (The Robert Plan). Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the surplus notes were to be repaid through profits received from a managing general agency relationship with The Robert Plan. When AIG deemed that repayment under the surplus notes was unlikely, AIG recorded the impairment charge as realized capital losses rather than underwriting losses. AIG now be-\\nFORM 10-K : 123\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n2. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial\\nStatements (continued)\\nlieves that this accounting treatment was an error and has restated the impairment charges as underwriting losses. -\\nAIRCO Reinsurance: In each of 1999 and 2000, AIRCO entered into stop loss reinsurance agreements with Union Excess relating to accident and health business of Nan Shan. Concurrently with each reinsurance agreement, AIRCO entered into a swap agreement with Union Excess, under which the payments were linked to payments under the reinsurance agreement. The transaction had the effect of converting incurred policy losses into capital losses. AIG has determined that its prior accounting was a misapplication of GAAP and has reversed both the cessions under the reinsurance agreement and the corresponding swaps. The effect of the restatement on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts is as follows:\\n•\\nAsset Realization. As a result of the internal review, AIG concluded that adjustments should be made to the value of certain assets included in its consolidated balance sheet. The most significant of these items are:\\n-\\nDomestic Brokerage Group (DBG) Issues: A review of allowances for doubtful accounts and other accruals recorded by certain DBG member companies has led AIG to conclude that the allowances related to certain premiums receivable, reinsurance recoverables and other assets were not properly analyzed in prior periods and that appropriate allowances were not properly recorded in AIG’s consolidated financial statements. Certain relevant information was known by certain members of senior management but, AIG now understands, not previously disclosed to the independent auditors. In addition, various accounts were not properly reconciled. AIG’s restated financial statements reflect the recording of appropriate amounts for these reserves and allowances for doubtful accounts for the appropriate time period, resulting in an after-tax reduction in consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 1999 of $514 million. Because all of the reporting periods affected by these adjustments were prior to 2000, the restatement results in decreases in insurance acquisition and other operating expenses for the periods presented. The effect of the restatement resulting from DBG issues on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts is as follows:\\n-\\nOther Than Temporary Declines: AIG’s investment accounting policies require that an investment that has been identified as impaired should be written down in the period in which such impairment is determined, and recorded as a realized capital loss. AIG has determined that realized capital losses with respect to certain impaired investments were not recorded in the appropriate periods, and the restatement will thus affect the timing of previously reported realized capital losses. The restatement resulting from other than temporary declines had only a minor effect on consolidated shareholders’ equity but affected certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts as follows:\\n•\\nOther GAAP Corrections. As part of its internal review, AIG has considered the application of certain accounting principles to specific businesses and transactions, and has determined that certain misapplications of GAAP are errors that require restatement of its financial statements. These adjustments include the following:\\n-\\nAccounting for Derivatives (FAS 133 Hedge Accounting): AIG and its subsidiaries, including AIGFP, engage in hedging activities for their own accounts, which AIG believes have been and remain economically effective. AIG\\n124 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\n2.

Such derivative transactions include interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forwards, which are generally executed through AIGFP. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 - “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (FAS 133) requires that third-party derivatives used for hedging must be specifically matched with the underlying exposures to an outside third party and documented contemporaneously to qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The internal review determined that in many cases AIG did not meet these hedging requirements with respect to certain hedging transactions. See Note 20 herein. AIG has historically reported the changes in the fair value of certain derivatives used for hedging activities through other comprehensive income in consolidated shareholders’ equity or in net income with a corresponding adjustment to the hedged item, depending on the nature of the hedging relationship. In order to comply with FAS 133, the restated consolidated financial statements include the changes in fair value for certain derivatives, previously recorded through other comprehensive income, in current period income and reverse the previous adjustments on certain assets and liabilities recorded in income in connection with hedge accounting. Because these activities did not qualify for hedge accounting, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 - “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” requires AIG to recognize the corresponding changes in fair value, including foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate fluctuations, relating to available-for-sale investments through accumulated other comprehensive income. These restatement adjustments with respect to FAS 133 do not result in any changes in AIG’s liquidity or its overall financial condition even though inter-period volatility of earnings increases. AIG is assessing the cost and benefits of modifying its hedging activities to obtain hedge accounting under the requirements of FAS 133. The restatement to reflect appropriate GAAP accounting for these derivatives, which also included reclassifications between the accounts securities available for sale, at market value and securities purchased under agreements to resell, at contract value, had the following effects on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts:\\n-\\nAccounting for Deferred Taxes: AIG identified certain misapplications of GAAP in its provision for deferred income taxes as follows:\\nFor certain foreign subsidiaries for which AIG has plans to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings, AIG incorrectly provided U.S. deferred taxes on the unrealized appreciation associated with investment securities in accumulated other comprehensive income. For certain foreign subsidiaries for which AIG does not have plans for permanent reinvestment of undistributed earnings, U.S. deferred taxes were incorrectly omitted on certain components of other comprehensive income. The restatement had the following effects on AIG’s consolidated net income and shareholders’ equity:\\nFORM 10-K : 125\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n2. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial\\nStatements (continued)\\n-\\nForeign Currency Translation (FAS 52): FAS 52 is used to determine the timing of the recognition of income or expense resulting from foreign exchange rate changes for transactions denominated in other than a functional currency. AIG has determined that, in certain cases, its application of FAS 52 in its consolidated financial statements did not comply with the functional currency determination requirements of the standard. As a result, AIG has recorded accounting adjustments to reclassify currency transaction gains and losses from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income. These corrections affected consolidated net income in certain periods but had no effect on consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2004 or for prior periods. AIG adopted a practice in the 1990s of recording adjustments to general insurance reserves to offset increases or decreases in such reserves through other comprehensive income, net of tax, resulting from translation of reserves denominated in foreign currencies. AIG now believes that this accounting practice was a misapplication of GAAP. As a result of this adjustment, general insurance reserves denominated in foreign currencies have been restated to restore the translation effect to reserve for losses and loss expenses. Together, these restatements had the following effects on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts:\\n-\\nLife Settlements. Life settlements are designed to assist life insurance policyholders to monetize the existing value of life insurance policies. AIG, through an insurance subsidiary and non-consolidated trusts, which are deemed to be a qualifying special purpose entity and a VIE, engages in this business. The non-consolidated trusts purchase life insurance policies from policyholders at an initial price and pay additional premiums to keep the policies in force until the insured dies. AIG’s proportionate share of the net death benefits from the purchased contracts, net of reinsurance to a third party reinsurer, was recorded as premium. The costs incurred by the trusts to acquire the contracts and keep them in force were recorded as paid losses by AIG, net of reinsurance. AIG’s accounting resulted in upfront gain recognition of expected profits and premium recognition for amounts loaned to the trusts by other AIG subsidiaries. AIG has determined, in light of new information which was not available to management or AIG’s independent auditors at the time the initial accounting determination was made, that the accounting for these transactions as insurance and reinsurance is a misapplication of GAAP that should be corrected through restatement. This restatement results in life settlements being accounted for using an investment method of accounting under FASB Technical Bulletin (FTB) 85-4 “Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance.” Under FTB 85-4, the carrying value of each contract at purchase and at the end of each reporting period is equal to the cash surrender value of the contract. Cash paid to purchase these contracts that is in excess of the cash surrender value at the date of purchase is recognized as a loss immediately and periodic maintenance costs, such as premiums necessary to keep the underlying contract in force, are charged to earnings immediately. The life insurance benefits at the insured’s death are payable to the AIG subsidiary and reflected in income at that time. The effect of the restatement on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts is as follows:\\n-\\nDeferred Acquisition Costs (DAC): The internal review identified a misapplication of GAAP with respect to General Insurance DAC. As a result of “top level” entries, substantially all costs associated with underwriting and marketing operations were deferred. The internal review determined\\n126 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\n2.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'doc_id': '5272_2004.htm#section_8::chunk25', 'section_id': '5272_2004.htm#section_8', 'section': 'section_8', 'section_title': 'ITEM 8.', 'filename': '5272_2004.htm', 'cik': '0000005272', 'year': 2004, 'chunk_index': 25}, page_content='Restatement of Previously Issued Financial\\nStatements (continued)\\nthat certain of these costs did not vary sufficiently with the production of business and should not have been deferred. These costs have been allocated to the periods in which they were incurred and the corresponding DAC asset has been adjusted accordingly. In addition, AIG determined that the amortization period for certain DAC was longer than the typical life of the underlying policies and needed to be shortened, and that certain deferrals associated with an inter-company reinsurance treaty were in error and required correction. This adjustment includes the recharacterization of certain incurred policy losses and benefits to Insurance acquisition and other operating expenses. The effect of the restatement on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts is as follows:\\n-\\nSICO Deferred Compensation: AIG has included in this restatement, expense amounts attributable to deferred compensation granted to certain AIG employees by SICO (pursuant to the SICO Plans described in Note 16 herein), a private holding company that owns approximately 12 percent of AIG’s common stock. The amount of deferred compensation granted by SICO has previously been disclosed in the notes to AIG’s consolidated financial statements but was not included as an expense in the calculation of AIG’s consolidated net income because the amounts had been determined not to be material to AIG’s consolidated results of operations in any individual period. The expense related to SICO deferred compensation is recorded as a charge to reported earnings in the periods restated, with an offsetting entry to additional paid-in capital reflecting amounts deemed contributed by SICO. For prior periods, AIG has recorded a reduction of $905 million in retained earnings on its December 31, 1999 consolidated balance sheet and a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital. The volatility in the expense is attributable to the variable accounting as well as the fact that shares are allocated only in alternate years. The inclusion of the expense attributable to the SICO Plans in AIG’s consolidated financial statements had no effect on consolidated shareholders’ equity but had the following effects on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income accounts:\\n-\\nCommutations: Certain direct insurance, and ceded and assumed reinsurance contracts, were commuted prior to their natural expiration. For certain commutations, the cash received was recorded through negative paid losses in accordance with statutory guidance, while for others it was recorded as written premiums. Despite the lack of guidance under GAAP with respect to this issue, AIG has determined that the accounting for certain commutations was in error due to the inconsistency in AIG’s accounting for commutations and the fact that certain commutations were recorded through the written premium line when there was no unearned premium balance outstanding. As part of this restatement any commutations that were originally recorded through written premium are reclassified to paid losses in the period in which they occurred. The restatement has no effect on consolidated net income or shareholders’ equity but affected certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts is as follows:\\n-\\nDollar Roll Transactions: In 2002 and 2003, certain AIG subsidiaries entered into dollar roll transactions with third parties designed to enhance the return on AIG’s mortgage backed securities (MBS) portfolio. In a dollar roll transaction, AIG subsidiaries agree to sell a pool of MBSs and simultaneously agree to repurchase substantially the same securities at a later date, typically in one month. AIG accounted for these transactions as collateralized financings under SFAS 140. Even though it had received collateral sufficient to fund substantially all of the cost of purchasing identical replacement securities at the time of transfer, AIG was not fully protected during the term of the contract to\\nFORM 10-K : 127\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n2. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial\\nStatements (continued)\\nreplace the asset in the event that the transferee defaulted. Accordingly, AIG should not have accounted for these transactions as financings, but rather as derivatives with mark-to-market changes reflected in earnings. The effect of the restatement on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income is as follows:\\n-\\nAffordable Housing: Through an investment limited partnership, an AIG subsidiary, as the general partner, syndicates the tax benefits (including both tax credits and tax losses) generated by affordable housing real estate properties. AIG guarantees the return of the tax benefits to the limited partner investors. Prior to the second quarter of 2003, these syndication transactions were accounted for as sales and the gain was recorded on a straight-line basis over ten years. Beginning in the third quarter of 2003, because of the guarantees, AIG changed its accounting for these partnerships to record all new syndications as financings, rather than sales. At the same time, AIG adjusted its consolidated balance sheet to reflect previous syndications as financings, but did not record the cumulative impact to earnings because the amounts were viewed as immaterial. AIG has now determined that it is necessary to record these adjustments for the periods prior to the third quarter of 2003, and the restatement had the following effects on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts:\\n-\\nSunAmerica Partnerships: As part of the restatement, management has reclassified the earnings of the SunAmerica partnerships out of other operations, where previously reported, into the Asset Management segment. This revised presentation characterizes the partnership earnings as revenues rather than as a component of insurance acquisition and operating expenses in AIG’s consolidated statement of income. Within the Asset Management segment, this presentation divides the partnership earnings into those of SunAmerica Life, whose equity supports the GIC business, and those of AIG SunAmerica, which are now classified as other asset management revenues. The restatement has no effect on consolidated net income and the effect of the restatement on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income accounts is set forth as follows:\\n128 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\n2.

SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\\nFORM 10-K : 141\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\\n3. Segment Information\\nIn 2003 and prior years, AIG’s operations were conducted by its subsidiaries principally through four operating segments: General Insurance, Life Insurance, Financial Services and Retirement Services & Asset Management. Beginning with the first quarter of 2004, AIG reports Retirement Services results in the same segment as Life Insurance, reflecting the convergence of protective financial and retirement products and AIG’s current management of these operations. Information for years prior to 2004 included herein has been reclassified to show AIG’s results of operations and financial position on a comparable basis with the 2004 presentation. These segments and their respective operations are as follows:\\nGeneral Insurance: AIG’s General Insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance.
