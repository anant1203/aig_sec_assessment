In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, AIG maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). AIG’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on AIG’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\\nNew York, New York\\nFebruary 23,\\nAIG | 2016 Form 10-K 169\\nAmerican International Group, Inc.\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\\nAIG | 2016 Form 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc.\\nConsolidated Statements of Income\\nAIG | 2016 Form 10-K 171\\nAmerican International Group, Inc.\\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss)\\nAIG | 2016 Form 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc.\\nConsolidated Statements of Equity\\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nAIG | 2016 Form 10-K 173\\nAmerican International Group, Inc.\\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\\nAIG | 2016 Form 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc.\\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\\nAIG | 2016 Form 10-K 175\\nITEM 8 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements | 1.

AIG companies serve commercial and individual customers through one of the most extensive worldwide property-casualty networks of any insurer. In addition, AIG companies are leading providers of life insurance and retirement services in the United States. AIG Common Stock, par value $2.50 per share (AIG Common Stock), is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: AIG) and the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “AIG,” “we,” “us” or “our” mean American International Group, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries and the term “AIG Parent” means American International Group, Inc. and not any of its consolidated subsidiaries.\\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AIG Parent, our controlled subsidiaries (generally through a greater than 50 percent ownership of voting rights and voting interests), and variable interest entities (VIEs) of which we are the primary beneficiary. Equity investments in entities that we do not consolidate, including corporate entities in which we have significant influence and partnership and partnership-like entities in which we have more than minor influence over the operating and financial policies, are accounted for under the equity method unless we have elected the fair value option.\\nCertain of our foreign subsidiaries included in the Consolidated Financial Statements report on different fiscal-period bases. The effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations of all material events occurring at these subsidiaries through the date of each of the periods presented in these Consolidated Financial Statements has been considered for adjustment and/or disclosure.\\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\\nSales of Businesses\\nNSM\\nOn August 31, 2016, we sold our controlling interest in NSM Insurance Group (NSM), a managing general agent to ABRY Partners, a private equity firm, for consideration of $201 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $105 million in the third quarter of 2016. We retained an equity interest in a newly formed joint venture and will continue to provide underwriting capacity to NSM. We also retained exclusive renewal rights for certain business written through NSM.\\nAscot\\nOn September 16, 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our 20 percent interest in Ascot Underwriting Holdings Ltd. and our 100 percent interest in the related syndicate-funding subsidiary Ascot Corporate Name Ltd. to Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB). Total consideration for the transaction was $1.1 billion resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $162 million attributable to AIG’s controlling interest, inclusive of CPPIB’s recapitalization of Syndicate 1414’s Funds at Lloyd’s (FAL) capital requirements. The transaction closed on November 18, 2016, and we received approximately $244 million in net cash proceeds.\\nKorea Fund\\nOn November 17, 2016, an AIG sponsored Fund (the Korea Fund), completed the sale of mixed-use commercial complex in Seoul, South Korea commonly known as the Seoul International Finance Center to Brookfield Properties for a total consideration of $2.5 billion, of which $1.2 billion was used to repay the fund’s debt. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain ☐ f $1.1 billi ☐ n included in Other Income, of which $464 million was attributable to AIG’s controlling interest.\\nUnited Guaranty\\nOn December 31, 2016, we sold our 100 percent interest in United Guaranty Corporation (UGC) and certain related affiliates to Arch Capital Group Ltd. (Arch) for total consideration of $3.3 billion, consisting of $2.2 billion of cash and approximately $1.1 billion of newly issued Arch convertible non-voting common-equivalent preferred stock and reported a pre-tax gain of approximately $697 million. We also received $261 million in pre-closing dividends from UGC in the fourth quarter of 2016.\\nConcurrent with the closing, we entered into reinsurance agreements with Arch, including an amended and restated 50 percent quota share reinsurance agreement and an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement, pursuant to which we will continue to be exposed to certain UGC policies written between 2009 and 2016.\\nAIG | 2016 Form 10-K 176\\nITEM 8 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements | 1.

(AerCap), in exchange for total consideration of approximately $7.6 billion, including cash and 97.6 million newly issued AerCap common shares (the AerCap Transaction). The total value of the consideration was based in part on AerCap’s closing price per share of $47.01 on May 13, 2014.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nShort Duration Insurance Contracts\\nIn May 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard that requires additional disclosures for short-duration insurance contracts. New disclosures about the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and net incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are now required (including accident year information). The annual disclosures by accident year include: disaggregated net incurred and paid claims development tables segregated by business type (not required to exceed 10 years), reconciliation of total net reserves included in development tables to the reported liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, incurred but not reported (IBNR) information, quantitative information and a qualitative description about claim frequency, and the average annual percentage payout of incurred claims. Further, the new standard requires, when applicable, disclosures about discounting liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and significant changes and reasons for changes in methodologies and assumptions used to determine unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.\\nWe adopted this standard on its required effective date of December 31, 2016. The required disclosures, reflected in Note 13, did not have any effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the roll forward of the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses currently disclosed in the annual financial statements will be disclosed as required for interim periods beginning in the first quarter of 2017.\\nDisclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard that requires management to evaluate and disclose if there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern even if the entity’s liquidation is not imminent. In those situations, financial statements should continue to be prepared under the going concern basis of accounting, but this new standard requires an evaluation to determine whether to disclose information about the relevant conditions and events. Currently under U.S. GAAP there is no guidance about management’s responsibility under this standard. U.S. auditing standards and federal securities law require that an auditor evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time not to exceed one year beyond the date of the financial statements being audited.\\nWe adopted the standard on its required effective date of December 31, 2016. The adoption of this standard did not have an effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\\nImprovements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued a standard that simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based compensation, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification on the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.\\nWe elected early-adoption of the Standard, effective January 1, 2016. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\\nFuture Application of Accounting Standards\\nRevenue Recognition\\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard that supersedes most existing revenue recognition guidance. The standard excludes from its scope the accounting for insurance contracts, leases, financial instruments, and certain other agreements that are governed under other GAAP guidance, but could affect the revenue recognition for certain of our other activities.\\nThe standard is effective on January 1, 2018 and may be applied retrospectively or through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings at the date of adoption. Early adoption is permitted as of January 1, 2017, including interim periods. We are currently evaluating the impact to our revenue sources that are in scope of the standard. However, as the majority of our revenue sources are not in scope of the standard, we do not expect the adoption of the standard to have a material effect on our reported consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\\nRecognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard that will require equity investments that do not follow the equity method of accounting or are not subject to consolidation to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings, while financial liabilities for which fair value option accounting has been elected, changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk will be presented separately in other comprehensive income. The standard allows the election to record equity investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes with changes in the\\nAIG | 2016 Form 10-K 182\\nITEM 8 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements | 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\ncarrying value of the equity investments recorded in earnings. The standard also updates certain fair value disclosure requirements for financial instruments carried at amortized cost.\\nThe standard is effective on January 1, 2018, with early adoption of certain provisions permitted. We are assessing the impact of the standard on our reported consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\\nLeases'),\n",

Certain of the measurements used by AIG management are “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules and regulations. Gross premiums written, statutory underwriting profit (loss) and combined ratios are determined in accordance with accounting principles prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities.

Sales inducements provided to the contract holder are recognized in Policyholder contract deposits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such amounts are deferred and amortized over the life of the contract using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize DAC (see Note 9 herein). To qualify for such accounting treatment, the bonus interest must be explicitly identified in the contract at inception. We must also demonstrate that such amounts are incremental to amounts we credit on similar contracts without bonus interest, and are higher than the contract’s expected ongoing crediting rates for periods after the bonus period. The deferred bonus interest and other deferred sales inducement assets totaled $808 million and $845 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The amortization expense associated with these assets is reported within Interest credited to policyholder account balances in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nThe cost of buildings and furniture and equipment is depreciated principally on the straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (maximum of 40 years for buildings and 10 years for furniture and equipment). Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred and expenditures for improvements are capitalized and depreciated. We periodically assess the carrying amount of our real estate for purposes of determining any asset impairment. Capitalized software costs, which represent costs directly related to obtaining, developing or upgrading internal use software, are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over a period generally not exceeding five years. Real estate, fixed assets and other long-lived assets are assessed for impairment when impairment indicators exist.\\nSeparate accounts represent funds for which investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to the policyholders who bear the investment risk. Each account has specific investment objectives and the assets are carried at fair value. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise from any of our other businesses. The liabilities for these accounts are equal to the account assets. Separate accounts may also include deposits for funds held under stable value wrap funding agreements, although the majority of stable value wrap sales are measured based on the notional amount included in assets under management and do not include the receipt of funds. For a more detailed discussion of separate accounts, see Note 14 herein.\\nOther liabilities consist of other funds on deposit, other payables, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities sold but not yet purchased and derivative liabilities. We have entered into certain insurance and reinsurance contracts, primarily in our Property Casualty Insurance Companies, that do not contain sufficient insurance risk to be accounted for as insurance or reinsurance. Accordingly, the premiums received on such contracts, after deduction for certain related expenses, are recorded as deposits within Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net proceeds of these deposits are invested and generate Net investment income. As amounts are paid, consistent with the underlying contracts, the deposit liability is reduced. Also included in Other liabilities are trade payables for the DIB and GCM, which include option premiums received and payables to counterparties that relate to unrealized gains and losses on futures, forwards, and options and balances due to clearing brokers and exchanges. Trade payables for GCM also include cash collateral received from derivative counterparties that contractually cannot be netted against derivative assets.\\nSecurities sold but not yet purchased represent sales of securities not owned at the time of sale. The obligations arising from such transactions are recorded on a trade-date basis and carried at fair value. Fair values of securities sold but not yet purchased are based on current market prices.\\nForeign currency: Financial statement accounts expressed in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars. Functional currency assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars generally using rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date of each respective subsidiary and the related translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of any related taxes, in Total AIG shareholders’ equity. Income statement accounts expressed in functional currencies are translated using average exchange rates during the period. Functional currencies are generally the currencies of the local operating environment. Financial statement accounts expressed in currencies other than the functional currency of a consolidated entity are remeasured into that entity’s functional currency resulting in exchange gains or losses recorded in income. The adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign entities operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in income.\\nNon-redeemable noncontrolling interest is the portion of equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent.\\nAccounting Standards Adopted During 2016\\nAccounting for Share-Based Payments with Performance Targets'),\n",

Accordingly, the AIG subsidiaries did not cede control over the bonds. As a result, AIG now believes that the conclusion not to consolidate was an error in the application of GAAP. Therefore, AIG has now consolidated the trusts into its balance sheets at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. The consolidations had no effect on consolidated shareholders’ equity but had the following effects on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts:\\n-\\nDBG/AIG Capital Corporation Intercompany Dividend: In 2002, AIG Capital Corporation issued shares of its preferred stock to National Union in exchange for shares of ILFC’s common stock. AIG did not eliminate the preferred stock investment in consolidation, instead recording the dividend as income in net investment income and as corresponding expense in other operating expenses. AIG has now determined that this accounting is a misapplication of GAAP. Accordingly, AIG has eliminated this intercompany investment and reversed the accounting entries in its consolidated statement of income. The adjustments and restatement had no effect on consolidated net income or shareholders’ equity but had the following effects on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income accounts:\\n•\\n“Top Level” Adjustments and Other Directed Entries (other than loss reserves). Certain accounting entries originated at the parent company level had the effect of reclassifying realized capital gains to net investment income, as well as adjusting other line item reclassifications and other segment financial information. In some cases, expense deferrals were increased or reserves decreased, both having the effect of increasing reported earnings. In other\\nFORM 10-K : 35\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\ncases, the adjustments affected revenue and expense recognition between reporting periods or among business segments. Certain of these entries were previously identified but considered not to be sufficiently material to require correction. As part of its internal review, AIG analyzed and assessed “top level” adjustments since 2000 and determined that certain entries appear to have been made at the direction of certain former members of senior management without appropriate documentation or support.\\n-\\nForeign Life Insurance Net Investment Income Reclassification: In addition to the matters described above, certain accounting entries, now determined to be errors, had the effect of reclassifying capital gains realized from investments made to match liabilities relating to policies in Japan and Southeast Asia. Due to the limited availability of long-duration bonds or bonds with sufficient yield to meet the policyholder liability requirements in Japan and Southeast Asia, AIG subsidiaries made alternative investments, including investments in equities. Until the fourth quarter of 2003, a portion of the capital gains realized on these alternative investments, including substantial amounts related to the sale of fixed income securities, was reclassified to net investment income in the consolidated statement of income to match these revenues against the incurred policy benefit expense of the underlying policies. Amounts so reflected, which were previously identified but not corrected as they were viewed as immaterial, are treated as corrections of errors in the restated financial statements, and are as follows: $57 million, $448 million, $278 million, $129 million, and $87 million for 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.\\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2004, a process was implemented to identify only certain equity-related gains in Southeast Asia and a limited amount of fixed income and equity gains in Japan and to segregate and treat such realized capital gains separately for segment reporting purposes only. The new process and limits were applied retroactively for 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000 as part of the restatement.\\nThe restatement reverses all such unsupported “top level” and other directed entries, including the Foreign Life Insurance Net Investment Income Reclassification, with the following effect on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts:\\n•\\nConversion of Underwriting Losses to Capital Losses. This category includes transactions and entries that had the principal effect of improperly recharacterizing underwriting losses as capital losses. Although these errors have a minimal effect on consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2004, they have an effect on underwriting results in each year. This category also includes insurance and reinsurance transactions where AIG’s accounting resulted in errors relating to the timing and classification of income recognition as well as errors relating to the timing of premium recognition.

In recent years, efforts to reform the tort system and class action litigation procedures, legislation to deal with the asbestos problem and the renewal of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act have been key issues, while in prior years trade legislation and Superfund had been issues of concern.\\nFORM 10-K : 53\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\\nThe following table summarizes AIG’s revenues, income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes and net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:\\nConsolidated Results\\nThe 23.3 percent growth in revenues in 2004 was primarily attributable to the growth in net premiums earned from global General Insurance operations as well as growth in both General Insurance and Life Insurance & Retirement Services net investment income and Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums. An additional factor was the decline in aggregate realized capital losses in 2004 compared to 2003.\\nThe decline in realized capital losses in 2004 reflects an improved economy, stronger corporate balance sheets and a significantly lower level of impairment loss provisions. The realized capital losses in 2003 reflect primarily impairment loss provisions. Upon the ultimate disposition of these holdings, a portion of these losses may be recovered depending on future market conditions.\\nAIG’s income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes increased 28.3 percent in 2004 when compared to 2003. Life Insurance & Retirement Services, Financial Services and Asset Management operating income gains, together with the decrease in realized capital losses, generated the increase over 2003 in both pretax income and net income.\\nThe following table summarizes the net effect of catastrophe losses for December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.\\n*\\nIncludes $96 million in catastrophe losses from partially owned companies.\\nThe following table summarizes the operations of each principal segment for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

General Insurance operating income includes catastrophe losses of $1.05 billion, $83 million and $61 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition, General Insurance operations generated realized capital gains of $220 million in 2004 compared to realized capital losses of $62 million in 2003. General Insurance operating income in 2003 was substantially higher than 2002 due to the $2.1 billion reserve charge in 2002.\\n54 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nLife Insurance & Retirement Services\\nAIG’s Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations provide insurance, financial and investment products throughout the world. Foreign operations provide over 60 percent of AIG’s Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income.\\nLife Insurance & Retirement Services operating income increased by 24.7 percent in 2004. This increase resulted from growth in each of AIG’s principal Life Insurance & Retirement Services businesses, and the capital gains realized in 2004 rather than the capital losses realized in 2003. Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income also grew in 2003 relative to 2002 by 22.6 percent.\\nFinancial Services\\nAIG’s Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified financial products and services including aircraft leasing, capital market transactions, consumer finance and insurance premium financing.\\nFinancial Services operating income increased in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to the fluctuation in earnings resulting from derivative activities that did not quality for hedge accounting under FAS 133. Offsetting this increase is the reduced income from Capital Markets operations and the effect of ILFC’s disposition of approximately $2 billion in aircraft through securitizations in the third quarter of 2003 and first quarter of 2004. Fluctuations in revenues and operating income from quarter to quarter are not unusual because of the transaction-oriented nature of Capital Markets operations and the effect of the FAS 133 adjustments. The charge relating to the PNC settlement, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings, also had a significant negative effect on results. Consumer Finance operations increased revenues and operating income, both domestically and internationally.\\nAsset Management'),\n",

The trust then issued two sets of beneficial interests. Half of the beneficial interests were floating interest rate certificates. The remaining beneficial interests were “inverse” floating interest rate certificates. Third parties invested in the floating interest rate certificates, and AIG subsidiaries invested in the inverse floating interest rate certificates. AIG did not consolidate the trust into AIG’s balance sheet.\\nThe AIG subsidiaries, as the holders of the residual interest inverse floating rate certificates, had the right to unilaterally liquidate the trust and cause the municipal bonds to be returned to AIG on short notice. Accordingly, the AIG subsidiaries did not cede control over the bonds. As a result, AIG now believes that the conclusion not to consolidate was an error in the application of GAAP. Therefore, AIG has now consolidated the trusts into its balance sheets. Because the program was discontinued in early 2003 there was no effect on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003: The consolidations had no effect on consolidated shareholders’ equity but had the following effects on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income accounts:\\n-\\nDBG/AIG Capital Corporation Intercompany Dividend: In 2002, AIG Capital Corporation issued shares of its preferred stock to National Union in exchange for shares of ILFC’s common stock. AIG did not eliminate the preferred stock investment in consolidation, instead recording the dividend as income in net investment income and as corresponding expense in other operating expenses. AIG has now determined that this accounting is a misapplication of GAAP. Accordingly, AIG has eliminated this intercompany investment and reversed the accounting entries in its consolidated statement of income. The restatement had no effect on consolidated net income or shareholders’ equity but had the following effects on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income accounts:\\n•\\n“Top Level” Adjustments and Other Directed Entries (other than loss reserves). Certain accounting entries originated at the parent company level had the effect of reclassifying realized capital gains to net investment income, as well as adjusting other line item reclassifications and other segment financial information. In some cases, expense deferrals were increased or reserves decreased, both having the effect of increasing reported earnings. In other\\n122 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\n2. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial\\nStatements (continued)\\ncases, the adjustments affected revenue and expense recognition between reporting periods or among business segments. Certain of these entries were previously identified but considered not to be sufficiently material to require correction. As part of its internal review, AIG analyzed and assessed “top level” adjustments since 2000 and determined that certain entries appear to have been made at the direction of certain former members of senior management without appropriate documentation or support.\\n-\\nForeign Life Insurance Net Investment Income Reclassification: In addition to the matters described above, certain accounting entries, now determined to be errors, had the effect of reclassifying capital gains realized from investments made to match liabilities relating to policies in Japan and Southeast Asia. Due to the limited availability of long-duration bonds or bonds with sufficient yield to meet the policyholder liability requirements in Japan and Southeast Asia, AIG subsidiaries made alternative investments, including investments in equities. Until the fourth quarter of 2003, a portion of the capital gains realized on these alternative investments, including substantial amounts related to the sale of fixed income securities, was reclassified to net investment income in the consolidated statement of income to match these revenues against the incurred policy benefit expense of the underlying policies. Amounts so reflected, which were previously identified but not corrected as they were viewed as immaterial, are treated as corrections of errors in the restated financial statements, and are as follows: $448 million and $278 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively.\\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2004, a process was implemented to identify only certain equity-related gains in Southeast Asia and a limited amount of fixed income and equity gains in Japan and to segregate and treat such realized capital gains separately for segment reporting purposes only. The new process and limits were applied retroactively for 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000 as part of the restatement.\\nThe restatement reverses all such unsupported “top level” and other directed entries, including the Foreign Life Insurance Net Investment Income Reclassification, with the following effect on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts:\\n•\\nConversion of Underwriting Losses to Capital Losses. This category includes transactions and entries that had the principal effect of improperly recharacterizing underwriting losses as capital losses. This category also includes insurance and reinsurance transactions where AIG’s accounting resulted in errors relating to the timing and classification of income recognition as well as errors relating to the timing of premium recognition.

This restatement results in life settlements being accounted for using an investment method of accounting under FASB Technical Bulletin (FTB) 85-4 “Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance.” Under FTB 85-4, the carrying value of each contract at purchase and at the end of each reporting period is equal to the cash surrender value of the contract. Cash paid to purchase these contracts that is in excess of the cash surrender value at the date of purchase is recognized as a loss immediately, and periodic maintenance costs, such as premiums necessary to keep the underlying contract in force, are charged to earnings immediately. The life insurance benefits at the insured’s death are payable to the AIG subsidiary and reflected in income at that time. The effect of the adjustments and restatement on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts is as follows.\\nRecently, the FASB tentatively concluded that life settlement contracts should be accounted for as an investment, held at cost, with no loss recognized at inception, and revenue recognized when the death benefit is received. In its discussions, the FASB tentatively concluded that retroactive application will be required. AIG expects that approximately $250 million of the restatement adjustment to shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2004 would be eliminated if the FASB’s tentative conclusion is adopted.\\n-\\nDeferred Acquisition Costs (DAC): The internal review identified a misapplication of GAAP with respect to General Insurance DAC. As a result of “top level” entries, substantially all costs associated with underwriting and marketing operations were deferred. The internal review determined that certain of these costs did not vary sufficiently with the production of business and should not have been deferred. These costs have been allocated to the periods in which they were incurred and the corresponding DAC asset has been adjusted accordingly. In addition, AIG determined that the amortization period for certain DAC was longer than the typical life of the underlying policies and needed to be shortened, and that certain deferrals associated with an inter-company reinsurance treaty were in error and required correction. This adjustment includes the recharacterization of certain incurred policy losses and benefits to Insurance acquisition and other operating expenses. The effect of\\n40 : FORM 10-K\\nAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries\\nthese adjustments on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts is as follows:\\n-\\nSICO Deferred Compensation: AIG has included in this restatement, expense amounts attributable to deferred compensation granted to certain AIG employees by SICO (pursuant to the SICO Plan described under Item 11. Executive Compensation), a private holding company that owns approximately 12 percent of AIG’s common stock. The amount of deferred compensation granted by SICO has previously been disclosed in the notes to AIG’s consolidated financial statements but was not included as an expense in the calculation of AIG’s consolidated net income because the amounts had been determined not to be material to AIG’s consolidated results of operations in any individual period. The expense related to SICO deferred compensation is recorded as a charge to reported earnings in the periods restated, with an offsetting entry to additional paid-in capital reflecting amounts deemed contributed by SICO. For prior periods, AIG has recorded a reduction of $905 million in retained earnings on its December 31, 1999 consolidated balance sheet and a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital. The volatility in the expense is attributable to the variable accounting as well as the fact that shares are allocated only in alternate years. The inclusion of the expense attributable to the SICO Plans in AIG’s consolidated financial statements had no effect on consolidated shareholders’ equity but had the following effects on certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income accounts:\\n-\\nCommutations: Certain direct insurance, and ceded and assumed reinsurance contracts, were commuted prior to their natural expiration. For certain commutations, the cash received was recorded through negative paid losses in accordance with statutory guidance, while for others it was recorded as written premiums. Despite the lack of guidance under GAAP with respect to this issue, AIG has determined that the accounting for certain commutations was in error due to the inconsistency in AIG’s accounting for commutations and the fact that certain commutations were recorded through the written premium line when there was no unearned premium balance outstanding. As part of this restatement any commutations that were originally recorded through written premium are reclassified to paid losses in the period in which they occurred. The adjustments and restatement have no effect on consolidated net income or shareholders’ equity but affected certain of AIG’s consolidated statement of income and balance sheet accounts as follows:\\n-'),\n",

For December 31, 2020 compared to September 30, 2020, we decreased our reversion to the mean rates of return (gross of fees) to 1.66 percent from 3.12 percent for the variable annuity product line in Individual Retirement, and to 0.55 percent from 2.87 percent for the variable annuity product line in Group Retirement, primarily due to recent equity market movements. The five-year reversion to the mean period did not meet the criteria for adjustment in 2020 which would have otherwise required a reset of the start date used in the calculation of the average gross long-term return rate. The long-term growth assumption used in our reversion to the mean methodology remained unchanged at 7.0 percent in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\\nFor additional discussion of assumptions related to our reversion to the mean methodology see Critical Accounting Estimates - Estimated Gross Profits for Investment-Oriented Products.\\nDAC and Reserves Related to Unrealized Appreciation of Investments\\nDAC and Reserves for universal life and investment-oriented products are adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the change in DAC, unearned revenue, and benefit reserves with an offset to Other comprehensive income (OCI) as if securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (shadow Investment-Oriented Adjustments). Similarly, for long-duration traditional products, significant unrealized appreciation of investments in a sustained low interest rate environment may cause additional future policy benefit liabilities with an offset to OCI to be recorded.\\nShadow adjustments to DAC and unearned revenue generally move in the opposite direction of the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, reducing the reported DAC and unearned revenue balance when market interest rates decline. Conversely, shadow adjustments to benefit reserves generally move in the same direction as the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, increasing reported future policy benefit liabilities balance when market interest rates decline.\\n136 AIG | 2020 Form 10-K\\nITEM 7 | Insurance Reserves\\nMarket conditions in 2020 drove an $8.7 billion increase in the unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity securities held to support businesses in the Life and Retirement companies at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, the shadow Investment-Oriented Adjustments reflected decreases in amortized balances including DAC and Unearned Revenue Reserves, while accrued liabilities such as policyholder benefit liabilities increased compared to December 31, 2019. Accrued shadow loss recognition reserves decreased from December 31, 2019, primarily due to the discontinuation of recognizing shadow loss recognition reserves related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets. Although these assets remain on AIG’s balance sheet, subsequent to the June 2, 2020 deconsolidation of Fortitude Re, AIG is no longer exposed to the returns on these assets and corresponding shadow adjustments because the assets economically belong to Fortitude Re as a result of the funds withheld arrangements with Fortitude Holdings.\\nFor further discussion on the sale of Fortitude Holdings see Consolidated Results of Operation.\\nReserves\\nThe following table presents a rollforward of insurance reserves by operating segments for Life and Retirement, including future policy benefits, policyholder contract deposits, other policyholder funds, and separate account liabilities, as well as Retail Mutual Funds and Group Retirement mutual fund assets under administration:\\nAIG | 2020 Form 10-K 137\\nITEM 7 | Insurance Reserves\\nInstitutional Markets\\nBalance at beginning of year, gross\\n$\\n23,673\\n$\\n21,762\\n$\\n20,645\\nPremiums and deposits\\n4,846\\n2,822\\n3,207\\nSurrenders and withdrawals\\n(1,788)\\n(984)\\n(2,034)\\nDeath and other contract benefits\\n(886)\\n(1,102)\\n(655)\\nSubtotal\\n25,845\\n22,498\\n21,163\\nChange in fair value of underlying assets and reserve accretion, net of policy fees\\nCost of funds*\\nOther reserve changes\\nBalance at end of year\\n27,342\\n23,673\\n21,762\\nReinsurance ceded\\n(45)\\n(44)\\n(44)\\nTotal Institutional Markets reserves\\n$\\n27,297\\n$\\n23,629\\n$\\n21,718\\nTotal insurance reserves and mutual fund assets\\nBalance at beginning of year, gross\\n$\\n297,872\\n$\\n270,820\\n$\\n280,861\\nPremiums and deposits\\n26,758\\n29,998\\n31,245\\nSurrenders and withdrawals\\n(22,991)\\n(25,099)\\n(27,802)\\nDeath and other contract benefits\\n(5,258)\\n(5,644)\\n(5,230)\\nSubtotal\\n296,381\\n270,075\\n279,074\\nChange in fair value of underlying assets and reserve accretion, net of policy fees\\n16,619\\n23,081\\n(10,393)\\nCost of funds*\\n3,477\\n3,524\\n3,367\\nOther reserve changes\\n(1,649)\\n1,192\\n(1,228)\\nBalance at end of year, excluding Fortitude Re reserves\\n314,828\\n297,872\\n270,820\\nFortitude Re reserves\\n28,505\\n30,441\\n28,747\\nBalance at end of year, including Fortitude Re reserves\\n343,333\\n328,313\\n299,567\\nFortitude Re reinsurance ceded\\n(28,505)\\n-\\n-\\nReinsurance ceded\\n(1,795)\\n(1,710)\\n(1,798)\\nTotal insurance reserves and mutual fund assets\\n$\\n313,033\\n$\\n326,603\\n$\\n297,769\\n* Excludes amortization of deferred sales inducements.'),\n",

It is defined as cash and unencumbered assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost. We endeavor to manage our liquidity prudently through various risk committees, policies and procedures, and a stress testing and liquidity risk framework established by our Treasury group with oversight by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Our liquidity risk framework is designed to manage liquidity at both AIG Parent and its subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six months under a liquidity stress scenario.\\nSee Enterprise Risk Management - Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification and Measurement and Enterprise Risk Management - Liquidity Risk Management below for additional information.\\nCapital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. Our primary source of ongoing capital generation is derived from the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. We must comply with numerous constraints on our minimum capital positions. These constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy at AIG and the individual businesses and are based on internally-defined risk tolerances, regulatory requirements, rating agency and creditor expectations and business needs. Actual capital levels are monitored on a regular basis, and using ERM’s stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital impact of potential macroeconomic, financial and insurance stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraints of both AIG and our insurance subsidiaries.\\nWe believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events.\\nNevertheless, some circumstances may cause our cash or capital needs to exceed projected liquidity or readily deployable capital resources. Additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in credit ratings, catastrophic losses or fluctuations in the capital markets generally may result in significant additional cash or capital needs and loss of sources of liquidity and capital. Other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include an economic collapse of a nation or region significant to our operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval. In addition, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.\\nFor a discussion regarding risks associated with COVID-19, see Part I. Item 1A. - Risk Factors - COVID-19 is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our global business, financial condition and results of operations, and its ultimate impact will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope, severity and duration of the crisis, and the governmental, legislative and regulatory actions taken and court decisions rendered in response thereto.\\nDepending on market conditions, regulatory and rating agency considerations and other factors, we may take various liability and capital management actions. Liability management actions may include, but are not limited to, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers. Capital management actions may include, but are not limited to, issuing preferred stock, paying dividends to our shareholders on the AIG Common Stock, paying dividends to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, and repurchases of AIG Common Stock.\\nAIG | 2020 Form 10-K 139\\nITEM 7 | Liquidity and Capital Resources\\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES HIGHLIGHTS\\nSources(a)\\nAIG Parent Funding from Subsidiaries\\nDuring 2020, AIG Parent received $1.8 billion in dividends and $108 million in loan repayments from subsidiaries. Of this amount, $1.3 billion consisted of dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our General Insurance companies and $473 million consisted of dividends and $108 million in loan repayments in the form of cash from our Life and Retirement companies.\\nAIG Parent also received a net amount of $1.7 billion in tax sharing payments in the form of cash from our insurance businesses in 2020, including $419 million of such payments in the fourth quarter of 2020. The tax sharing payments may be subject to further adjustment in future periods.\\nRevolving Credit Facility\\nOn March 20, 2020, AIG Parent borrowed $1.3 billion under its $4.5 billion committed, revolving syndicated credit facility, which amount was repaid in full with interest on June 9, 2020.\\nDebt Issuance'),\n",

For additional information about the DOL Fiduciary Rule, see Part I, Item 1. Business - Regulation. We have been analyzing the DOL Fiduciary Rule’s potential impact on our customers, distribution partners, financial advisors and our Individual Retirement and Group Retirement businesses, and preparing to implement the necessary adjustments to achieve compliance with the DOL Fiduciary Rule. Overall, the DOL Fiduciary Rule as currently promulgated would result in increased compliance costs and, as currently promulgated, may create increased exposure to legal claims under certain circumstances, including class actions. The DOL has also issued interpretive guidance on the DOL Fiduciary Rule, and we are evaluating whether or not this guidance would affect the actions we would need to take to comply with the DOL Fiduciary Rule.\\nOn February 3, 2017, the new administration issued a memo requiring the DOL to review the DOL Fiduciary Rule and determine whether the DOL Fiduciary Rule will adversely impact the ability of retirement savers to access information and financial advice. Accordingly, the DOL announced that it would consider legal options for postponing the applicability date of the DOL Fiduciary Rule while the DOL considers the issues raised in the referenced memo. We are closely following the DOL’s pronouncements about further delays to the DOL Fiduciary Rule’s effective date.\\nImpact of Currency Volatility\\nCurrency volatility in 2016 and 2015 was acute compared to recent years, as the British pound weakened considerably against the U.S. dollar in 2016, although the Japanese yen strengthened against the U.S. dollar. The euro also weakened modestly against the U.S. dollar. Such volatility affected line item components of income for those businesses with substantial international operations. In particular, growth trends in net premiums written reported in U.S. dollars can differ significantly from those measured in original currencies. The net effect on underwriting results, however, is significantly mitigated, as both revenues and expenses are similarly affected.\\nThese currencies may continue to fluctuate, in either direction, especially as a result of the UK’s expected exit from the EU, and such fluctuations will affect net premiums written growth trends reported in U.S. dollars, as well as financial statement line item comparability.\\nLiability and Financial Lines, Property and Special Risks, International Life Insurance and Personal Insurance businesses are transacted in most major foreign currencies. The following table presents the average of the quarterly weighted average exchange rates of the currencies that have the most significant impact on our businesses:\\nUnless otherwise noted, references to the effects of foreign exchange in the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance discussion of results of operations are with respect to movements in the three Major Currencies included in the preceding table.\\nAIG | 2016 Form 10-K\\nITEM 7 | Consolidated Results of Operations\\nConsolidated Results of Operations\\nThe following section provides a comparative discussion of our Consolidated Results of Operations for the three-year period ended December 31, 2016. Factors that relate primarily to a specific business are discussed in more detail within the business segment operations section. For a discussion of the Critical Accounting Estimates that affect our results of operations, see the Critical Accounting Estimates section of this MD&A.\\nThe following table presents our consolidated results of operations and other key financial metrics:\\nAIG | 2016 Form 10-K 63\\nITEM 7 | Consolidated Results of Operations\\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of General operating and other expenses to General operating expense, operating basis, which is a Non-GAAP measure:\\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of pre-tax income/net income (loss) attributable to AIG to pre-tax operating income/after-tax operating income attributable to AIG:\\nAIG | 2016 Form 10-K\\nITEM 7 | Consolidated Results of Operations\\n* For 2016, because we reported a net loss, all common stock equivalents are anti-dilutive and are therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted shares and diluted per share amounts. However, because we reported after-tax operating income, the calculation of after-tax operating income per diluted share includes 30,326,772 dilutive shares.\\npre-tax income (LOSS) Comparison for 2016 and 2015\\nPre-tax results decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to:\\n• adverse prior year loss reserve development in Commercial Insurance of $5.6 billion in 2016 compared to $3.3 billion in 2015; and\\n• net realized losses compared to net realized gains in the prior-year period due to:\\n- foreign exchange losses in 2016 compared to foreign exchange gains in 2015 primarily due to $910 million of remeasurement losses for a short-term intercompany balance;\\n- the sale of Class B shares of Prudential Financial Inc. and common shares of Springleaf Holdings, Inc. (Springleaf, now known as OneMain Holdings, Inc.) in 2015; and\\n- a net decrease of $1.4 billion related to guaranteed living benefits, net of hedges, primarily due to movement in the non-performance or “own credit” risk adjustment (NPA) component of the embedded derivative fair value measurement and 2016 actuarial assumption updates to surrender and mortality assumptions (see Insurance Reserves - Life and Annuity Reserves and DAC - Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefits and Hedging Results).\\nThese decreases were partially offset by:'),\n",
